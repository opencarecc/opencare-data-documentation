Hello there,   I am copying a story on behalf of Filippo, a volunteer to the community of  pemphigus, an auto-immune disease that affects skin layers, causing them to detach, form blisters, among other complications.   Filippo will join the conversation, but we wanted to speed up the onboarding barrier, while link the story to other software volunteers whom we met at the MakerFaire in Rome.  Lets see how his works ;)" Just as first input, a simple idea that is needed is a “scratching indicator”?This is something missing in the scenario, I mean some app that using a wearable device (like a apple watch or something designed ad hoc – a simple arduino like mb with an accelerometer should be sufficient) can identify the scratching movement of the arm an apply an indicator.The objective is to measure a quantity (a number) that indicate the duration and the intensity of scratching activity of te patient, building a sort of standard to be used for that  that kind of patoloty and patients to be used to analyze the efficacy of specific therapy on one of the worst and less understood symptoms, the itching.  This could be the starting point of this app for pemphigus/pemphigoid patients, (but not limited to them), that can be integrated with other functionalities aiming to “measure” efficacy of therapies granting an indication of the status of the patient. Do you think this could be a valid input to start the discussion?"  
How can we get better as groups at learning from the experiences we go through? I have been wondering about new approaches to care and this question has been much in my mind since interviewing members of the public during a project about the “word on the street” in Liverpool in 2015. It was a sobering month in which I came to know personally just how disaffected and disenfranchised the public felt about anything changing for the better in England.  In a comment on the Edgeryders community call on improving how we support each others mental and spiritual health, I wondered if “everyone who lives in a distributed area is in some way involved in processing the emotions experienced in that place”. I feel a great potential for technological networks to create rituals and bring people together to process experiences in new ways. Generally, I'm talking about creative networks for coming back to life: networks that invite people into a social experience to care about themselves and other people, to keep hold of their hopes, to understand beyond their own spheres of experience and to find support in being the magician of their own life. This is speculative stuff, I realise, so I’ll anchor my offering to this strand in real examples and share work that I know of and am making.A frank admission to start: the subject of networks of care is relatively new terrain for me. I’m no expert and there are long histories and contexts that I cannot represent here.  I really welcome feedback, criticism, references and most of all, examples of working networks already in place. There are many excellent examples and the diversity of reports shared on this site - the variety of food sharing initiatives, performance and storytelling circles, maker spaces and innovative support systems - is informing my learning around this subject.One of the areas that show most clearly the positive effects that community interventions can have are post-conflict efforts. In this post, I want to tell you about the powerful work of theTrust for Indigenous Culture and Health (TICAH) who developed a program with survivors of the Nyayo House Torture Centre and other centres in Kenya. In a follow up piece I will look more at digital systems with a mind to exploring how elements of ritual and and formalised events for expression and listening might be tapped into in new ways to support communities through online means. Facilitating Forgiveness: the hardest job there is?I met Denis Ngala when I was doing some work in Timbavati, South Africa. He is a tall, radiant and infectiously joyful character, utterly grounded and with a sense of spiritual authority having spent most of his twenties studying in a seminary. He told me a lot about the work that he was doing in Kenya with TICAH and the problems that faced victims of torture returning to society after they had been released. Details of the intense suffering and the physical and mental abuse that went on in Nairobi’s Nyayo House torture chambers and other places of detention during President Moi’s regime are still emerging decades later. Ngala was working at facilitating meals for torture victims and their perpetrators where they could have honest discussions in an attempt to heal these old wounds. He told me that often the victims and perpetrators of the violence were people who grew up in the same village and had studied at neighbouring schools so he was often bringing together people who had known each other throughout their lives. The kind of emotional resolve and resources needed for either survivor or perpetrator to face the horror of the past and sit down together, share food and listen to each other’s stories is frankly extraordinary. But Ngala describes his methodology when convening these meetings as based on simplicity: “it is rooted in listening to one another and honouring each life story.” His role as the third party, guiding the conversation, ensuring that each person spoke and was listened to has had truly beneficial effects. He tells me that some who have gone through the process visit each other and share their childhood stories or are able to meet at public occasions.One very illuminating aspect of this work is that the focus goes beyond the individuals directly involved. TICHAH has looked to help educate the wider community to understand what had happened and how to support it. This was necessary as without  intervention communities often closed up, and rather than accepting the survivor back into social contact they viewed the returning survivor with unease and distrust, creating a situation in which survivors sometimes found themselves ostracised, left to deal with the experience alone. TICHAH met this situation with interventions that emphasised embodied communication and the creative body. They invited those effected to walk a labyrinth together in a peace ceremony and organised body map workshops that brought together different survivors to share their stories. The body-mapping workshops use art skills to trace participants’ bodies and then map elements of their life stories onto this body map: visual elements are added that stand for the individual’s aims, what supports them, the traumas they have lived through and their strengths. These visual records are a way of introducing the details of what happened in captivity back into the community to be held by everyone. So the labyrinth walking and the body-mapping make the real lives, bodies and experiences of the victims a public experience and enable the wider community to listen to and appreciate how these survivors managed to live through painful and unbelievably challenging times. The Human ElementThis is incredible work - through these interventions TICAH help communicate that the process of recovery is not the problem of the victim of torture alone, but is in a very real sense owned by the whole community. One striking aspect is the emphasis on accepting the seriousness of the situation - dealing with the very worst of what humans can do to each other - with vital, dramatic, expressive interactive meetings. The labyrinth walking is profoundly beautiful group ritual and the body mapping opens up the assembled individuals to listen to the challenges that others have lived through, and it does this in a joyful and creative way. Reconciliation over food feels innately right. The activities though almost timeless in their simplicity are unusual and unexpected, and generally unlike anything that any of the participants have done before. The act of doing something new is particularly suited to transforming problems as there are no painful memories attached; it opens up new horizons and is perhaps more likely to lead to a renewed present. When I ask Ngala what networked technologies could do to help these efforts he replies that they could help facilitate expression: “In this work there are problems, most of them could be solved through sharing. When survivors are given opportunities to share their stories they heal fast. Networks would provide a good platform for people to share their experiences. Sharing could be done through writing or be spoken. Narrations could be recorded and later could be used to make short clips.” I think of just how possible this is as it is poses a clear and actionable technological problem, but looking at Ngala I wonder whether he realises how key his presence is to the process and the quality of the interaction. What forges the profound shifts in people’s experience is how their expression is received, listened to, validated and responded to. When speaking with Ngala, a man with vast generosity of soul and focused attention, you really do feel stronger. He beams at you and honours your presence in a way that is rare. In conversation with him you feel that your words matter, your life is respected and that miraculous healing is possible. Popular culture tends to talk about purging emotions, as if emotions are toxic material that needs ejecting from your system, but what Ngala’s work shows is that the magic is in the courage to speak honestly and the grace of being heard: that’s when emotions turn into understanding. The human catalysts at TICAH are so much a part of why these reconciliation attempts have been successful and any attempt to extend the work through technology needs to factor this in at the centre. Simplicity of invitation, creative expression, embodied shared experience, working and listening to others, ritual time and focus, the unexpected, all these feel like good leads for designing a transformative care network. TICAH’s emphasis on shared humanity and that each person is a human being with a different story encourages survivors and perpetrators alike to stand strong in themselves, to understand the past and live a better day.  I think of post-conflict creative efforts like http://reflections.org.np/ that creatively depict the subjectivities of Nepali people in the aftermath of the earthquake. There is a courage in projects that present every person, even though they may have lived through horrendous circumstances, as a human being with a unique story and power.Digital Networks for Creative CareStrong mutual care is essential not only in places seeking to recover from atrocities, but generally for people working together and sharing space, especially if they are "living on the edge". Change is difficult and every group liable to conflict. E.C. Whitmont writes in The Symbolic Quest that “The seeming inevitability of conflict among the archetypal "powers" can cause us to experience life as a hopeless, senseless impasse. But the conflict can also be discovered to be the expression of a symbolic pattern still to be intuited.” There's a potential that we can reach into the intuitions that come out of difficult experience and grow understanding of group dynamics to create pathways that do not end in violence, abuse and waste. The sad cases of suicide, sabotage, ill health and conflict that we know of in digital tech, startup and hacker cultures show that forging wisdom in this area is important. I feel the need for strange networks of care: unusual, compelling networks that don’t attempt to fix anyone but make healing and self-understanding an adventure and help individuals back into the simple joys of communion and creativity. To explore group dynamics and coherence in recent projects I’ve been involved in, I've worked with beans http://www.rootbeans.com/, with dreams (following the method of my mentor Apela Colorado) http://oneiricarchives.tumblr.com/ and with storytelling http://www.thehaguecenter.org/pathways-project-2/.  Back up in Liverpool we're improvising on Stafford Beer's work on group dynamics in public meetings. Whether it’s VR group therapy where you experience your own body and other people in highly unusual ways or group Skype rituals for reconciliation the whole notion of care networks is wide open for innovation and renewal. As a guiding design point I think the only answer to questions like how can ritual time be held online or how can digital networks provide the intensity of feedback of live interaction is bold creativity. If you have examples of creative online systems to faciliate group communication and support that go beyond a message board or online forum and become something more vital and "live" please share them.  I’ll be at 33C3 if there’s people from the Edgeryders community who want to meet around the theme of hacking strange networks of care. There’s also an option to organise a session: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Static:Self-organized_Sessions Learning in Doing There is a huge amount of trauma recovery material and contexts for group psychology that I do not know about. It is challenging terrain. As much as it’s essential to tread carefully, it is also necessary to create. The outpouring of emotional pain, anger and concern after the American election makes clear a need for strong communities of action and bold ways for participating in new stories. As worrying as is the prospect of making mistakes around mental health, the more worrying prospect is not creating networks to meaningfully connect up alienated, isolated or suffering individuals. Local actions, online networks and communities are all growing this November: each network has a different focus. Involving digital technology to reimagine group psychology and care (beyond Facebook) is just one of the potentials to help these evolving networks support themselves. Ngala’s experience shows that targeted and bold ventures can reboot the community’s ability to support and that there is the possiblity of even the most horrific of violations healing. The greatest thing that I learnt from Ngala is the scale of his belief. When I ask him what has been the most illuminating discovery about human care through facilitating this work he replies: “The most amazing thing is we are all human who heal despite all the experiences we have met in life”.  His belief is born out by his experience. It is vital not to miss the transformative quality of having one person believe in another. I consider the enormous amount of work and transformation needed in the decades ahead to meet the problems of our time and then I think about three human beings sitting down for a meal in Kenya and have the sense that great tasks are possible if we learn to work together. Links on article: http://ticahealth.org/ http://www.ticahealth.org/files/TICAH-nyayo-house-torture-body-maps.pdfInterview with TICAH’s founder Mary Ann Burris with details on body mapping: http://practicalmattersjournal.org/2011/03/01/burris-interview/https://twitter.com/TICAH_KEPhoto: Denis Ngala in South Africa The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
Drawing from Alex's proposal here, collecting here some ideas for the concept and format."VAULT Festival is a multi-week line-up of non-stop entertainment across eight unbelievable venues, three stylish bars and a top-notch restaurant, all hidden away within the labyrinthine Vaults beneath Waterloo."A Fundraising WorkathonWe connect the attendees of the event together, bringing new support and volunteers to organisations in the UK (and further afield), creating the opportunity for collaboration and skills sharing in the future. (Alex)->the event becomes an opportunity where sponsor company employees co-work on their professional company project, and the payment for the day goes into a common fund directed to a non-profit (most obvious choice is Crew for Calais). SourceA Writers' ChallengeWe set out to solve a problem that the people who are likely to attend could help solve. The number one target on my list is: How can we change the prevaling narrative about refugees in the UK? As part of this has to do with the stories we tell about them, and who tells them, it fits really nicely into the other work that we are producing at the festival as well. (Alex)-> the event becomes a space for meaningful human encounters between people who wish to learn and make a contribution to building a new media narrative around refugees. A playful mix of Storytellers and Capturers combining various media (text, visuals, audio, video etc) produce and reproduce what are essentially deeply human stories.-> we'd need experienced journalists, (v)bloggers, data people and art storytellers to support the creative processCreative concepts: New Media Therapy, Citizen Journalism, Data Journalism, #nofilter #nostigma-> modelled on an event in Kathmandu in 2015 - Call for participation | Planning document-> Morroccan volunteer led blog-> Humans of NY style for massive outreach.-> Parts:I.

That participants articulate what they found most relevant from key case studies: in personal statements, live introductions or by leaving comments online prior to the event. That participants can locate their role in a brokerage model for a new deal between institutional politics, media landscape and the individual's own possibilities to take meaningful paths of action. That participants design a fair value proposition for the communities which their workshop output is intended to serve.  That main insights from the meeting are summarised in the form of high quality blogposts to be posted on the event and partners platform no later than a week after the event. That participants are sent a follow up email with all summaries and reminder of what has been agreed and what the next steps are.  What we need to pay attention toHow to structure collaborative writing? The long collaborative writing session was possibly a bit disorienting. I don’t know, did participants enjoy this time, or did they feel left alone to “work for us”? Since the sharing time session worked so well and was seemingly more interesting, a next writers’ workshop might consist of just the sharing session (and the presentation sessions before). Not every participant would have to come with a text to share, some might enjoy to hear the comments and discussions when others share, and learn a great deal from that about how to write.

Open Insulin is one of many projects at Counter Culture Labs, a biohacker space in Oakland, CA. Counter Culture Labs was founded around 2011-2012 by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests. Members joined us from Sudo Room, another hacker space in Oakland, and Biocurious, a biohacker space in Sunnyvale. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Eventually, the community we built in the hacker space reached a critical mass of knowledge and interest around the idea of starting to producing insulin with a manual protocol, but one designed to be simpler and less expensive than existing methods. We named the project “Open Insulin” to reflect a commitment to make the results freely available to any interested party and publish our methods openly. The name was a deliberate reference to open source software.Open source, as many readers may know from the software world, is the practice of making all information necessary to produce and modify a product publicly available along with the product itself. It started in software as an alternative to the practice of providing only machine-readable copies of programs, which can’t be understood or practically changed by users of the software. Without access to human-readable code, users and other stakeholders were shut out of their own tools. Open source methods of production are relevant not just to aligning incentives and improving the economics of software development, but also to scientific reproducibility and transparency, and in both software and science, open source can enable more participation and progress than trying to hold secrets close. In medicine in general, and diabetes treatments in particular, I think it holds one of the keys to breaking through the barrier between promising research and a stagnant market of treatments available to patients, just as it made software much more efficient to produce and use and enabled a great deal more innovation than was otherwise possible.A few of the crew of Counter Culture Labs. Open source software and the hacker culture that makes it was a major inspiration for biohackers to organize as such. “Biohacker” derives from the term “hacker” in the sense used in the communities of early pioneers of computing, where it’s a term used to refer to people who seek to understand how things work on the inside, instead of just using products as a consumer. Hackers are people who seek to modify things to serve their own purposes, instead of just accepting them as being limited to their originally intended purposes. It’s an approach that emphasizes the philosophical concepts of phronesis and techne, which describe an embodied, contextualized, practical approach to things, applied to science and technology. Biohackers are people who take a practical approach to understanding and engineering biological systems, and look beyond appearances and inside the black boxes of commercial products to understand the substance and true implications of things.If we can achieve the creation of open source insulin, it could contribute to at least three important goals - first, by making insulin production more economical at a smaller scale, and opening up manufacturing to much more competition, it could improve cost and access for patients. Second, we hope the protocol will serve as a basis for future research into improvements to insulin - variants that are longer acting, shorter acting, more temperature stable, and so on - that address different concerns that arise in treatment. Third, we hope it might serve as a basis for research and production of other proteins by small groups, and open up participation in research and development to accelerate progress in other aspects of diabetes treatment besides insulin and other areas of science and medicine besides diabetes treatment.Currently we’re working on a novel method to produce human insulin, which is not patented, and as far as I know is not patentable. There are variations on normal human insulin to make them longer or shorter acting, which involve very small changes to the sequence that codes for human insulin.The green fluorescence in these tubes of purified protein from our cultures is the visual indicator that suggests our proinsulin-containing fusion protein has been expressed successfully. We’ve been working in the lab for about 10 months, and we’re just seeing the first signs of success on our first major milestone, the production of proinsulin, which is the precursor to insulin. Once we’ve verified our success there, we’ll move on to making the final form of insulin.A 3D printed model of insulin shows how the two chains of the protein must be bonded together to obtain the correct, active form of the protein. We face two main challenges. First, while we are a group of talented and curious folks, most of us are learning challenging lab protocols from scratch, and second, we’re working with limited amounts of time and money, fitting the work into gaps in our schedules left by work or school, and mainly relying on surplus equipment and reagents that add delays and uncertainties to our work. So progress can be slow and involve a lot of detours on top of those implied by the already uncertain nature of scientific investigation, and we have to dig deep to figure out what to do next when something goes wrong. We do our best to learn fast, but it’s difficult to follow up on everything we should with our limited time and resources and background knowledge. There’s a lot of practical wisdom around making insulin that doesn’t show up directly in the papers published in scientific journals, and we’re learning these nuances of making things work as we go. Much of the value we hope to provide to the community is documenting as much of this practical wisdom as we can, and perhaps eventually automating the kind of work we’re doing by hand right now.If all goes well, we hope our techniques will be available to people with diabetes, especially to help meet the needs of people in resource-poor and lower-income countries. However, it’s hard to say at this point when we might be able to deliver a result useful for making a pharmaceutical-grade product. After the scientific work, which might take a few years, there will be the work of seeking business partnerships and going through more engineering work and the biosimilar approval process in the US. In other areas of the world, it may be simpler, but might also involve more unusual local political considerations. We’re hoping that our work will inspire others to move in parallel alongside us and increase the chances that one group will succeed quickly, and there are some preliminary signs that this is happening, which could yield results sooner. But there’s no doubt we’re at the start of a very long and winding road.We’ve had the good fortune to have many experts in relevant fields reach out to advise us to smooth out our path, but many important questions remain, and the most important ones remain for us to find new answers. Scientists who are reading this – can we count on you to contribute your expertise in protein expression and purification? Organizers – can you share with us your vision for expanding these efforts into a movement with participation from parallel groups like ours around the world?The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
Lately I’ve been having sudden cravings to get offline and do to things with my hands which don’t involve a keyboard. With several people in town we hosted a community dinner as a way to take action against something happening every day under our noses - massive good food throwaway. By households, restaurants, markets and especially supermarkets, by you, by your family, by your neighbor, by me. We collected food close to being dumped and got people to cook together and share a meal while interacting heavily around the issue.I won’t ramble about why it’s important we pay more attention to food overall - from where and how far it comes from, the cost of having nicely chopped avocados on a restaurant plate, to how we pick stuff off the supermarket shelves and never wonder where the brown bananas are going, to how we realize our canned peas are overdue after having been hidden in overstuffed fridges or pantries (it’s a trap!). You know this already, right?Food Waste Combat in Cluj (FWC) is a local collective experimenting with creative ways to address the issue, and I joined them for many selfish reasons, but mostly because I’d like to see food activism reach educated, resourceful urbanites. I’m one of them and I think as a group we can do better. We’re well positioned to use a tiny bit of our time doing something other than work, other than expensive hobbies, other than just consuming. It seems teaching each other how to eat is a pretty low hanging fruit.More photos here.We set up a 60 people afternoon event in a week, in a very lightweight mode.I think it’s worth sharing why and how we did it:Context exists - a Repair Cafe Week full of activities in town and already talking about circular economy. That helped promote the event in only a few days time in a period quite busy for Cluj, helped it be part of a bigger mobilization and also get some media attention. Large enough venue is available - The Paintbrush Factory, a former factory-turned-contemporary-art-collective has a cosy room for events equipped with minimal cooking infrastructure; we were able to bring add-ons with no problem (except the lights going off for like an hour, but well, can’t plan it all! :-)) Crazy levels of enthusiasm and capacity are just.. there! I don’t know if it’s the food effect, but so many people chimed in and brought own assets to the table: Cimbru, a local food truck with patient cooks helping everyone find a role; Casa de Cultura Permanenta, a local open house already prototyping circularity in every possible way! and their resident volunteers; FWC team coordinating on an online wiki to plan and split tasks; photographers supporting the cause; Local markets and a large shopping centre donating throw away food and also pretty decent one! It took us up to two hours to collect 35 kg of fruit and vegetables. You spend more time getting to and from locations than on the actual food collection. Outstanding community connectors gently nudging everyone - how else could you mobilize effortlessly a team of teams?! @Ponyo  is one of them for sure. Some pocket money is available - we spent 200 Romanian lei (
[@Noemi’s note] I was happy to connect with Emma Jones, who is in her words, a third of the We Mental Health Nurses team at WeCommunities, along with Vanessa Garrity and Mark Brown. This story serves as a first encounter with Edgeryders. It also includes written reflections by Vanessa.WeMHNurses hosts regular mental health themed twitter chats, as part of a network chat calendar, with wildly diverse topics ranging from “The use of digital technology in everyday practice” to “Workplace democracy in mental health”. The core team runs the day to day operations, on a purely voluntary basis, with the WeMHNurses account, also linking into the wider WeCommunities, which covers many different branches of Nursing and Health Care professions and specialism. Topics for chats tend to mostly emerge from topical conversations within the community or where there is, for example a national policy directive or key piece of published journalism relating to mental health. The community also run sponsored chats for national bodies such as the Dept of Health, Care Quality Commission and NHS England. The WeMHNurses team see their role as being about facilitating broader conversation in a democratised digital space, where everyone can have a voice, regardless of positional authority. The team also see their role as being to make national policy more accessible, in terms of the language being used. The community also has a particular focus on discussing the everyday implications of policy on mental health nursing practice.The chats are generally facilitated by one of the @WeMHNurses team, with guests are often invited to participate in the chat where the person brings specific expertise to the conversation. This is an open process, whereby anyone can contact the team to suggest a chat topic or to ask to host a chat.The team provide support to individuals who want to host a chat from the @WeMHNurses Twitter handle.Our ethos is very much that “your opinion matters” and we focus on the user point of view, getting people talking to each other and bringing a variety of perspectives to the conversation. We enjoy working with people who have previously been in services or are currently in services because we really value the lived experience perspective. As we are an independent voice, we will also cover topics that might be considered controversial, political or critical, as we believe that these conversations are important in setting the future direction for mental health nursing.On reflection, we think that the liveliest and most informative chats are often where there is a real mixture of perspectives, including for example, clinicians, people accessing services, managers, leaders, academics, researchers and policy makers. The conversations that we have online are often very powerful for this reason as we can’t think of many examples from our own professional lives, where there has been such a variety of voices in a room to debate a topic in such a level and democratic way. An example of this is a chat that Vanessa and Mark ran with the Health Service Journal, where we discussed the reduction of inpatient mental health beds across the country. This chat was very much brought to life by people sharing their experiences of how this impacted on them personally when they needed to access inpatient care.The demographics for our chat suggest that we have a largely UK audience. However, because of the global reach of Twitter, we do have some international representation within our community and we love to encourage this because of the dimension that it brings to the conversationBefore we run a chat, we produce some pre chat information on the wecommunities website. This is generally written in a blog style, so it is broadly accessible reading. We are also looking at how we can make our chats even more inclusive, such as by providing audio for people who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. The challenge for us is that we are all volunteers, so we have to find ways of delivering information quickly.How come this twitter format for talking about mental health? Is there something in the medium that helps learning, or alleviation for individuals?As with everything there are always pros and cons. Some would say “there’s only so many characters on twitter” and mental health can be a very complex topic to discuss with limited characters, especially when people are talking about personal experience. On the other hand, it can help you be more focused and concise in what you are trying to say.I suppose using twitter to talk about mental health is quite personal, as is twitter use in general. There are many who find it hugely therapeutic and helpful, either getting involved in chats, communicating/ networking with others or for gaining support. It is a fab place for the sharing of information, including research and it's also a great forum for challenging stigma and moving the mental health agenda forward.Wordcloud from participants twitter bios in a recent chat - source.Is there a cutoff number for participants in a chat? Or a number that makes it effective? I’m wondering because you have such high regularity - every week.There is not a maximum number of people in each chat, it can be anybody using the hashtag. Often people pop into the chat with just one or two tweets, whilst at the same time, we are having a conversation with other people, who participate in the entirety of the chat. When you are facilitating a chat, which is busy, it can be a challenge responding to every single tweet, but we do try to do this and often we find that people branch off and have separate conversations with other participants, within the chat, which goes down a different path to the structured questions of the main chat. Providing they still use the hashtag, we still capture this conversation in the transcript at the end. This is an example of the latest archived chat on a Tuesday evening, counting 133 contributors, 1200 tweets and with a reach of 7,561,098! This was a joint chat with @wenurses and @weldnurses.With our over 6000 followers, plus the wider network, I suppose it is hard to say how many people we reach constantly. However, analytics for the chat are captured within the wecommunities website. Nick Chinn is the technical person behind this at Wecommunities.What do you think draws people in? What makes it a community for you? Is it people interacting with each other, learning, figuring out stuff?I suppose it is all of that. Everyone involved in the chats is interested in that particular area and that shared interest drives the discussions and questions in the chat, which will often support the development of links between people. Often people in the chats might say: ‘this is a good chat’, and ‘why don’t we do one on this other topic area?’ It then keeps expanding, and there are more things that we get involved in. So, in essence, the community is about sharing knowledge and learning, being open to thinking in different ways and developing a support network as well.What for the future and how can we support your work?We are very aware that people establish relationships and friendships offline with people who they have connected with on Twitter and that these relationships are often a great source of strength and support for people. Vanessa and Teresa Chinn, Founder of WeCommunities organised an unConference earlier in the year, through crowdfunding, which brought together 300 people from the community into a physical space to get together and to debate and discuss the future direction of social media in health care. We also provided a parallel online agenda throughout the day, so that the twitter community could still very much be part of it, even if they couldn’t physically attend. Vanessa and Mark from WeMHNurses and Mental Elf on Twitter are also in the process of setting up a Digital mental health conference service, which we are launching at #PDDigital16 later in November.
Summer 2015. It was nearly the end of August when Kos Island turned into a battlefield during a registration procedure. Hundreds of protesting migrants demanding quick registration began blocking the main coastal road. The local police attempted to break up the crowd with batons and by spraying foam with fire extinguishers. An officer was being filmed slapping and shoving migrants queueing outside the local police station.My grandmother came to mind and her story as a refugee child from the area of Pontos (Northern Turkey) in 1922. I just couldn’t believe that something like that could happen again. Despite the fact that Greece, in the throes of its worst ever financial crisis, was straining to accommodate the inflow, most Greek islanders were doing their best. But still there was an ominous feeling in the air.And then I saw that photo. A young woman with her two frightened children hanging onto her arms. Walking to nowhere, barefoot. Beyond endurance, angry but determined to survive the crush. Fearless, though! Imperious! I got angry. I stood beside her, out there in the dust. I'm just one step away from being like her.That moment I realized that there isn’t any Deus ex Machina to save them. To save us.So, I started thinking… What would I need if I were there? What should I carry to help my children withstand it? What should I bring with me for a little break? ...and their feet! What will happen to their feet? And the sun? It's hard being a parent in peace. In war and in refuge, only a hero.I wrote a list* with the necessities. The obvious, the necessary, even those things that seemed unnecessary. The goal was to ease the burden of parents, to give a smile to children. A breath until the next aid. A hope...I post the list in my private facebook profile. I couldn’t imagine the impact of this simple action. In a few days people were coming to my place, bringing bags full of nearly everything! Friends, neighbors or strangers were coming to help. We‘ve been preparing backpacks and sending them to Idomeni, to the islands or anywhere they were needed. Many schools adopted the idea and soon the campaign went viral. In around 8 months, hundreds of people became mobilized and focused on helping this endless wave.It seems that we could tell a lot of stories about, and because of this, but the point now is what emerged from this need. There's a lot of information coming out in the aftermath of this experience.There’s a mountain of questions that we didn’t answer…Is there any kind of system in the world that could cope with that amount of people?What was wrong and why didn't anyone know how to react or to organize?Why weren't we ready? Why didn't governments, NGO’s and independent groups cooperate? And when they did, what happened?What socks are most appropriate for their long trek?How can we fit all the necessary items in a backpack?And what about the weight?How can we gather the right clothing from the world?Have you ever try to sort thousands of clothes?Is it true that women from Syria didn’t want to wear rain boots?And what about UNHCR’s wool blanket?And all those tons of food wrappers, wet wipes, bottles...?Sadly, it turns out that there was no rescue plan in place. Greece seems to be inefficient and Europe appears like an impregnable fortress. This brings up the question “What if a sudden disaster left millions of Greeks or other Europeans homeless and helpless?”Local authorities and their services operated superficially while the government was obviously unprepared. On the other hand, citizens reacted vigorously and passionately despite the fact that they didn’t mobilize immediately.It’s also notable that many conferences, workshops or unofficial brainstorming meetings took place and new technology-oriented groups were created.  New ideas and solutions were proposed and innovative applications were developed from people all over the world. However, most of those didn’t fall on fertile ground for wide use, thus must be investigated thoroughly in the future.Due to my profession as a fashion designer and manufacturer, when I heard about all those calls for clothing needs I started wondering who will manage all these diverse supplies. When facing a disaster, food and medical aid are considered top priorities but it’s not widely known that wearing inappropriate clothing under extreme conditions can become life threatening.It’s noteworthy that if we focus on specific issues we can come to interesting conclusions e.g. Public misinformation by “official” announcements that were based on internet searching or common knowledge about clothing. As a result, there was a shortage of A-shirts (tank tops) while, considered useless, thousands of used socks were gathered although it costs less to buy new ones. Also, acrylic socks were suggested as the most appropriate. But when there’s no luxury of changing them anytime, other materials are more suitable like; wool, bamboo, cotton, tactel etc.Obviously, a problem, arisen from common everyday items, is more complicated than initially thought and requires an expert's opinion.So, without surprise, no one reached out to experts from the clothing sector for professional advice and assistance. Moreover both government and UNHCR ignored any proposals or contact efforts.Surely, the day after was going to be a nightmare. Inexperienced volunteers struggled to adequately classify, pack and distribute huge amounts of donations. Very often the same material had to be sorted again and again for multiple times. The inadequate coordination among government authorities, NGOs, solidarity groups and other stakeholders in combination with the anxiety of refugees led to a disappointing result. Large amounts of food, clothing, medicines and a lot of useless things (that could be a separate funny story), were being carried around Greece like a giant pinball machine. Unnecessary shipments, aid wasted, corrupted by mold, insects or still remain in inappropriate warehouses. A serious waste of resources.In conclusion, the refugee crisis gave rise to a strong solidarity network and also an opportunity for local communities and the society in total. An innovative strategic plan seems to be a necessity, in order to coordinate and manage all the available resources successfully.We should focus on organizing and training ourselves for cases of emergency. Based on the strength of these sharing communities, we should work, in innovative ways, which could bring people together around common concerns, recognize and increase their skills and knowledge and instill in them a belief that they can make a difference.In addition, it’s important to develop a survival handbook with the aim to provide “how-to” guidance based on practical experience in combination with academic knowledge. And the challenge is to respond to all these arisen questions. Or add new.“Could humanitarianism be evolved as a profession or it could be a new way of living?”P. S.More than 1/5 of donations is unsuitable for the refugees, thus is channeled to other vulnerable groups directly or in cooperation with already existing structures.Most of the volunteers gave up, burned out or feeling unable to help. Meanwhile the main responsible for this failure get paid.More than 60.000 refugees stuck in Greece. The majority were transferred to military camps, old factory warehouses or other abandoned and unhealthy places. Out of sight, out of mind. Lost and forgotten. *The winter list for children: Small backpack, waterproof poncho, aluminum blanket, flashlight, socks, rain boots, sports shoes or plastic clogs, underwear, a tracksuit or a change of clothes, cap, gloves, scarves, lunch box, plastic spoon, fork, knife, a bottle of water, cookies, nuts, dried fruit or other snacks, wet wipes (small package), tissues, toothbrush, samples (of sunscreen, shampoo, toothpaste etc.), a toy, note or drawing pads, crayons, pencil, sharpener, eraser, a whistle and a wish (!!)

Fifteen years ago, I wrote an academic paper on the incipient technology of digital advertising screens, the way they were likely to change our experience of urban living and the challenges they posed to our conceptions of self, privacy and the public realm.At the time, such technologies were the stuff of science fiction movies – part of the classic ‘Blade Runner’ aesthetic of cosmopolitan dystopia. Most people did not anticipate their widespread adoption, and certainly did not consider their subtle social implications; but for those who did, perhaps the most haunting fear about their probable dissemination was the certainty that the social and psychological changes they engendered would quickly become the new status quo, unnoticed and unquestioned.Passing through Kobenhavn airport this morning, a digital advertising screen promoted this month’s ‘Presidents Summit’ on the topic of ‘Disruption’: “Disruption will change your job. Disruption will change your company. Disruption will change the world. Join our world leading summit and learn how to lead the change and make sure you are one of tomorrow's frontrunners.”That the idea of ‘disruption’ has moved from the radical edge of digital culture and post-2008 political insurgency to the topic of a plenary meeting of senior executives – featuring speeches by Apple’s Steve Wozniak and arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage – shows the degree to which the concept has spread through society to become the ‘new normal’; a sign, perhaps, of just how much the pace of social, technological and economic change has increased since I fretted about the novel impact of moving images on the urban populace.But it also raises the question of how much of this disruption is merely cosmetic – or, rather, how much the very genuine disruption of ordinary lives only serves to bolster the established iniquities of our current economic and political status quo. If disruption is merely another business opportunity from the playbook of ‘creative destruction’ capitalism, if the elite response to it is simply to fight harder to be one of ‘tomorrow’s frontrunners’ (while those who can’t keep up must, presumably, be left behind), then perhaps this is merely another case of plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.If so, what would genuine disruption look like? Is it possible that it might look like the opposite of all this? That it might look like a rejection of these kinds of disruption? The stories emerging from the OpenCare initiative suggest that this may be the case. Again and again, the tales that emerge are of a less hierarchical, more empowering approach to health and care; of individualised, human-scale responses to unique instances of wider social problems; of a movement away from the paradigm that measures ‘efficiency’ of care in terms of speed, throughput or numbers discharged – measured, in short, on how fast the system can cease to be in relationship with the citizens who have sought aid.True disruption, then, might not look like the world-spanning, high-octane revolutions beloved of the senior executives. It might look like slowness; like quietness; like a return to engagement at the scale of the human being. It might just turn out that old is the new new.My own involvement with OpenCare stems from a very particular form of healthcare, based on something very old, small and quiet – the Community Multibed Acupuncture Clinic (CMAC). Community Acupuncture is a new version of an old format of providing a very old form of medicine – using traditional East Asian methods, it eschews the one-to-one treatments most common in the West, instead adapting the traditional Chinese model of treating multiple patients at once in the same room. This enables treatment to be offered more cheaply, as well as creating a shared space of communal healing, so that healthcare becomes a site of community empowerment. There are now over 170 such clinics in the US and more than 50 in the UK (you can read about their history and ethos on the websites of POCA and ACMAC).As I detailed in my original Opencare blog post, I have been slowly evolving a CMAC of my own to serve a small and somewhat dysfunctional market town in the South-West of the UK. Through this process, a number of tough lessons and intriguing insights have emerged, with broader implications for the innovative provision of care in contemporary European societies.I subtitled my initial post “An Ongoing Mutation” both in reference to the overall development of the approach in the West and to my own experience of developing a clinic. This experience has been one of trial and error, of creative response to practical and bureaucratic challenges, and of constant adaptation to feedback from – and through ongoing relationship with – the community; as I learn more about their needs and perspective, I have changed the way I am treating, the way I interact with patients, the hours treatment is offered and the venue it is offered in.To ask, as a state bureaucrat convinced of the usefulness of CMACs might, “how can we replicate this so that we can roll it out across the country at an official level?” rather misses the point; it is precisely by being embedded in the community that this process of creative mutation can occur, and precisely by meeting patients outside the usual structures of state-sanctioned medical authority that a more horizontal trust and respect can be created, and a more creative approach to healthcare provision enacted.Like many of the other projects featured in OpenCare, the flexibility of Community Acupuncture – light on infrastructure, expensive medical equipment or architectural requirements, reliant instead on the portable diagnostic and treatment skills of the practitioner – makes it well-suited to navigating a disrupted present and an uncertain future. Quite aside from its effectiveness at treating unexplained and chronic conditions (the kind mainstream Western medicine does not excel at curing), having the ability to treat without reliance on fragile, resource-intensive and environmentally-damaging industrial supply chains may well prove to be a great asset in the near future. Indeed, the worth of this is already being proven through the work of charitable foundations like World Medicine, who have set up successful CMACs in poor, rural areas of India, Palestine, Nepal and Sri Lanka.Problems still remain, not least with the institutional resistance to acupuncture – often based on little more than ill-informed prejudice against ‘alternative’ medicine. There are clashes within the acupuncture community, as well, on how best to treat, and issues with providing quality-assurance and redress to patients whilst working outside the usual channels and institutions of healthcare.Nevertheless, the popularity and effectiveness of CMACs speak for themselves. All too often, the state-established institutions of care remain locked into a post-imperial perspective, treating the body, the patient or the polis as the passive subject of a homogenised, top-down intervention.It is a little like a digital advertising screen, broadcasting a single, one-way message to a public who have no choice but to receive it. Just like a digital advertising screen, this kind of healthcare can seem cutting-edge, innovative and technologically impressive, but its values do not respect the uniqueness of individual or place, nor do they promote communal solidarity and empowerment. So long as this is the case, communities will continue to vote with their feet, seeking out new forms of adaptive Open Care that address their real mental, physical and social needs. *** I would love to see Community Acupuncture being integrated with some of the other projects and approaches detailed in OpenCare; to hear suggestions about how the CMAC model could be further improved and evolved; and, as ever, I am keen for people to educate themselves about acupuncture, to help fight against the misguided myths that have arisen about it, and to spread the word about this affordable, effective, environmentally-friendly and humane form of medicine!Steve Wheeler, Lic.

Saturday: baby milk bottle official price = 10 poundsSunday: baby milk bottle not available in marketsMonday: army goes down to the market with 30 million milk bottles, the price: 30 pounds, the media goes like: “the army saved our babies, long live the army”This is a routine scene in lands of horror.The previous scene sums up the role of our government in our lives, a direct enemy you try to avoid day by day, and freedom of expression is guaranteed on the walls of bathrooms in prisons.Faceless states and everything about it was dark.Based on the above, we had to find mechanisms to ensure us to life in the light of repression, but we are lucky, all we had to do is follow a system of solidarity that exists already in our values and upbringing. One of the basics of this system, the most simple rule of it, you find in the words of prophet Mohammad: "he does not enter the paradise, he who whoever sleeps full of, while his neighbor is hungry".You find also in our beliefs that god will be on your side as long as you are on the side of your brother.Mostafa Khalifa, the Syrian novelist, in “The cochlear” is talking about a young man who was arrested for twenty years, the charge - muslim brotherhood. The guy was a.. Christian. In the same novel: talking about a group of young people, call them silf (Fedayeen): their mission is receiving torture instead of the elderly and sick people and those who lost and those who lost their endurance, can you imagine that the (Fidayeen) were singing under torture: "O prison darkness come, we love darkness, inevitably after this long night daybreak is coming"By the way altruism is still there and it is main reason why the Syrians in Syria are still alive.Social solidarity is in its worst conditions in this war but still can feed the hungry and keeps warm to those who are cold. For example the project of "grace conversation" in Damascus which provides medicine for thousands of families from excess medication at other families, and also "maoayed alrahman" which are food tables spent by the Syrians with very high annual cost ( 50 million dollars) in 2014 through all the cities. In addition to internal displacement thousands of families are participating with their homes and food and many other live examples.The shape of our lives makes us one body: we know our relatives, enjoy their joys, get sad for their sadness. The satisfaction of our grandparents is as important as our parents.The poor celebrate double in our holidays because of a race for goodness, because the concept of "Eid" in the perception of Islam linked to "Zakat" which is basically the process of cleansing the money by giving the poor his legitimate right of the money which is 2,5 percent of annual profits in secret. If there is no secrecy Allah does not accept it .And many annual grants to the poor some of it linked to time, and some linked to personal events like "Akika" which is slaughtering two rams and distributing them to the poor when the child is born.Of course every rule has exception but the united community can overcome it.Every citizen has moral responsibilities and he is already indebted to the community.There is no perfection of course, being in Europe allows me to discover the value of freedom, human value, accept differences, respect the personal space, working hard. To be precise I have to admit that the western civilization is the mirror which we see the deterioration of our situation through it, and the image we want to be closer to.The respect for the human person, the system of rights and duties, which I respected from the first day. But living in the middle east gives you the chance to see the dark face of that world, the military training field I came from taught me to not believe the existing models, the part of relations of states specifically.I’m talking here about the weapons/arms markets, and other markets based on the dead bodies of other states. Especially after watching the news talking about Aleppo, Mosul … etc Cheap games to prolong the war, unlimited support for the parties of the conflict, in exchange for contracts and concessions we will know in the future.Transforming the world into struggles areas to gain wealth, and safe areas to enjoy the wealth.Religion also had a lion’s share in the misuse and legitimization of wars has nothing to do with religion and history is full of examples. The equation of religion and ignorance had a devastating impact through history and nowadays it is very clear that faith without understanding is more dangerous than earthquakes, with corrupt regimes support hate speech that all you need to have new Libya, and with governments are the direct enemy to their citizens you will have Syria or Iraq if you are lucky , and in order to not equate the killer with the victim, I blame the governments for expanding the circle of ignorance, and put the platforms in the service of semiconductor scientists and intellectuals.Under these conditions the best thing you can get to is the Egyptian model, with hungry ignorant people afraid to be like those in Syria or Iraq, governed by fascist goverments.But I believe in the communion of civilizations.The ashes of war go away by time, and civilization remains.For some reason we live short lives, nobody knows the reason more than you, nobody can tell you what is the ideal way of thinking, but for sure at least in the civilized world we can be like ants villages, be single hand for the good of future generations, to get a world does not force you to be a refugee, a world where mankind life in the first consideration, morality and intelligence to regulate relations.My message to the reader:Keep readingNo one has a monopoly on truth, it is somewhere in the middle, I don’t have it, but I have part of it, we complete each other, you and me are pieces of the puzzle. Let’s talk with each others, accept each other.The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
Our challenge is to rewire neighbourhoods to take care of teenagers tending to the specific needs of their age, addressing the formation of social emotions, vocation and self knowledge.Europe's population decline must be addressed not only regarding maternity and natural population decrease, but also promoting the dynamic and innovative qualities the younger generations always contribute to society. Making young people relevant, inviting them to our social life, giving them a frame to belong in a European future is the necessary counterbalance for our aging and shrinking population.The rate of cultural change linked to technology has been constantly increasing and initiatives to educate our people must overcome institutional slowing down, if our societies are to participate significantly in the future.Education, learning & the value of teenagersTraditional educational systems are failing to take social changes into account. The inertia of national states behind educational institutions is failing to answer to the reality of communities that are experiencing social change at a faster than ever rate. The future we imagine cannot be reached following old pathways.Teenagers are left out of social life, with no appropriate spaces or other activities expected from them, apart from attending compulsory school until an age that keeps rising as the human life cycle prospers. In a phase of life characterized by passion and vocation, loads of energy and bluntness, teenagers in Europe find themselves institutionalized and irrelevant.«Future Tools» project is an acknowledgment of the value teenagers have for society: they hold our future in their hands. «Future Tools» is a space designed with caring attention to fit the needs of our young generation, aiming to connect them to a new world of opportunities by inviting them to work, to collaborate, to participate and to have a voice in their own community. We can now apply our knowledge about adolescence to provide a comprehensive environment in which teenagers can develop healthy social emotions, autonomous and egalitarian participation.Provide an alternative to corporate uses of technology through the culture of the commons; spread collaborative habits in neighborhoods; build activities rooted in intrinsic motivation that bloom in communal benefit are some of the ways «Future Tools» will engage people in fostering a society with greater equality, solidarity and sustainability.«Future Tools» is a common learning lab for teenagers. By offering youngster a place to gather and pursue their interests while promoting their autonomy, we aim to empower them to work for a better future. Sharing resources and interests in an alternative learning space, the culture of collaboration and the democratizing possibilities of technology, this place will have its roots in the neighborhood’s daily activities and funnel the parents’ interest in social promotion for their kids towards a more inclusive society.The abundance of open resources that can be freely accessed through personal learning environments to learn digital skills —such as computational thinking, governance software, UX design, in fact any skills that we may need to implement our projects in the world— is an opportunity, never known before to such a widespread extent, to empower our youngsters to build a better future.Neighboring environmentThe neighborhood as a community comes to relevance in the task of «helping grow adults». The age group that most closely matches the Secondary Education stage in our culture has in the neighborhood its spatial range of freedom, just one step away from the wide world they will live in as adults. Connecting these neighboring communities to the global emergence of the digital culture as makers and participants through their own teenagers is a pertinent, strengthening link between local and broader communities.It is urgent for these generations of parents and offspring to leap forward over institutional stagnancy and give ourselves the shared resources we can provide for our own borough, in every neighborhood, nurturing our tribe-prone teens from the gang to the team, by building around them the common ground for community.It is sometimes sad hear stating that what is being promoted for innovation in the field of education —on the basis of empathic personal exchange, attention to the tempo, sensibility for intrinsic motivations, in short: the wisdom of caring for each other— are outdated methodologies. Digital tools offers a new breeze to these methodologies, an opportunity to enhance the soft aspects of learning and allow us to cast aside production-line techniques when it comes to our kids: lecturing, memorizing, exams, ringing bell schedules, curriculums and subjects. We can now afford those luxuries our industrialized schools didn't plan for and, dragged by institutional inertia, won't anytime soon.
'Are you on a mission? And how come that trauma - such a heavy word, such a serious matter - is your passion?' That is what people ask me when they hear about my tour, about me and my bus traveling through Europe to talk and teach about trauma and to try to soften the pain of trauma. 'No, I am not on a mission (that is a far too 'religious word for me to befriend with) - and yes, trauma is my passion, and I do have a message.I really believe that pain should come in the open. That it should be de-tabooed: we should know more about it, understand better what traumatic pain is, how it functions, how it takes possession of us, we should be able to look at it more closely, to be with it (for a while). Trauma, pain, fear ... we'd rather not experience it or watch it happen in someone else's life. It is like with 'death': we know it is part of our lives, we all have to deal with it, and yet we don't - because it's (too) uncomfortable. How to talk about human mistreatments, heavy physical pain, profound disrespect of your person, or situations where you felt like if your life was in danger? How to share the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness that go with such pain? We often do not know how to do that, and try to ban painful events and feelings from our minds, we want to forget about it.It is something in pain itself too. We're hardwired to avoid and suppress pain. It helps us survive, it helps us to go on. Avoiding, minimizing and denying pain is our most natural, short term solution to deal with pain. It is a survival mechanism. It often takes a while, from seconds to minutes, to physically feel the pain caused by an accident, a car crash or a broken leg. Not feeling the pain gives us more time to save ourselves, to get away from danger.  Out of the car, walk away and call the ambulance f.ex. On the long term, however, not feeling isn’t very effective. Because it is impossible to heal from something we don't acknowledge. On the long term, suppressed pain comes back to us, like a boomerang. That is what trauma and traumatic pain is about: it is pain that doesn't seems to go away, pain that stays with us far too long, as a residue of what happened to us.I believe that this residual pain needs to be addressed more openly.  Traumatic pain can be softened - and it should be. Because unresolved trauma makes us sick, depressed and heavy-hearted. It deregulates us, deeply and on many levels: mind, heart and body. We know that traumatic pain lies at the heart of most contemporary diseases, be they mental or physical, we know that trauma adds to almost every sickness as a major contributing factor. And yet ... the knowledge about trauma and how to address it to lower its dramatic impact on our lives is far from common.That is what my tour is about: I want the world to be trauma-informed.I want people to come and look at the pictures on the bus and ask questions. I want them to learn about trauma and realize that healing is possible. We can all learn best practices regarding talking and coping. We can all learn to calm down and regulate a body in fight, flight or freeze modus. We can all learn techniques to stop nightmares and flashbacks. We can all learn to help traumatized persons recover. It often takes not more than 15 minutes to help people sleep better: help them release tension before they go to bed, by offering a relaxing breathing exercise, or teach them to intervene in their dreams by using their imagination, by rehearsing a different ending for their nightmare f.ex.We are all on a mission: to a certain degree we all need to become trauma specialists. First, we need to deal with our own trauma's and those of the people around us. We need to dare to feel and face our pain instead of running away from it. Second, there's too much suffering in the world as to leave its resolution to the clinical field or therapeutic setting. Therapeutic knowledge should be accessible to all of us, it should not be protected and copyrighted. Therapeutic knowledge should be alive in the world, not only in shrinks’ offices. That is why I do what I do: share my knowledge about trauma with you, share insights, methods and techniques from the field of trauma healing ... so that we can all, together, ease and soften the pain in our world.  I don’t know of any other projects sharing therapeutic knowledge in the way Trauma Tour does. But the idea of a trauma-informed world is related to a growing field of ‘self care’: taking responsibility for one's own (mental) health by reading self help books, attending self help groups, becoming experience experts, … It is long known that helping on this ‘equal’ level, is often more effective than any method or technique. It is also known that the relationship between ‘therapist’ and ‘patient’ is a major factor when it comes to healing. If we combine both, ‘helping expertise’ and ‘being equal’, it seems a very natural thing to come out of our offices and share therapeutic knowledge with those who suffer. It makes ‘us’ helpers and ‘them’ traumatized people equal human beings, fellow human beings. It restores humanity.I’m now in the middle of planning my first big tour: driving down the Balkan route and visit Greece in December 2016 / January 2017. If you’re reading this and you want to support Trauma Tour, please check out my website, there’s a list of things you can do to help me : call me in for a training, be my local host on my way down to Greece, put me in contact with people who might need me … An easy and very effective way to support Trauma Tour is to make a financial contribution - I thank you for that!The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
"Podziemne Państwo Kobiet" is both a documentary and a collection of abortion stories from Polish women who had illegal abortions in the past two decades. Poland most likely is the only country in the world that had abortions legal by law (1956-1993) and changed it "backward". We ended up having one of the most restrictive laws in the world, and the legislators were smart, by avoiding criminalizing women (with whom society would sympathize) and focusing instead on everyone else who assists with abortions (the penalties are up to 8 years in prison), creating a system of fear and paranoia. The first thing that strikes about abortion in Poland is the statistics - according to Polish Ministry of Health in 2013, there were 744 legal abortions and 718 of them due to the risk of birth defects. 3 of them due to rape and 23 due to the risk posed to women health. In 2015 there were 1044 legal abortions. For a country with 38 million inhabitants, these numbers seem just wrong. In Spain or UK, these numbers are 200 or 400 times higher. And it's estimated that illegal abortions every year account for between 80.000- 200.000 cases in Poland. So, what kind of abortions are available in the underground and how do women access it?Chirurgical abortions are one of the common ways. They usually happen in hidden spaces, often barely up to any standards, with basic equipment, sometimes only in the presence of doctor (women who come to get the abortion might end up assisting them). The price of an abortion is at least 2000 zl (500 euros), and it tends to go up with the standard. In some cases, when doctors are well connected, they can even perform them in hospitals, which would double the price. Many doctors who refused to perform a legal abortion are perfectly fine with doing it illegally after settling the price with their patients. Considering that the minimal wage in Poland is 1850 zl, and the average is 4000 (yet many people struggle to get contracts, work on 3/4 of full time, or often work on irregular gigs earning even less than 1000 zł a month with no minimal wage per hour), the price is quite prohibitive and exclusive. Many women end up taking loans to pay off their abortions. Nowadays, women contact pro-choice organizations to find out who can help them with abortion. Since the 90ties, press and internet advertisements were the ways to find doctors who'd perform them. Such services would be named as "painless restoration of menstruation" - and involve either chirurgical help or access to drugs, highly overpriced. In many cases a friend or a relative knows who does it in your town. The fear and paranoia remain anyhow - women are asked to leave the clinic right after the procedure is done, regardless of their condition, in order not to bring suspicion. They're asked to park their cars far away from the place of appointment. Some of the informal groups specialize in organizing abortions abroad. Ciocia Basia, a group of volunteer activist, helps to organize legal abortions in Berlin. For a price of 290/390 euros, they arrange pharmacological and chirurgical abortions in clinics, help with translations and offer a couch for the women coming over. Another popular destination is Slovakia and Czech Republic - it's super easy to find websites in Poland of clinics in these countries that provide with professional and anonymous help. Prices are similar to those in Polish underground.And then you have the pharmacological abortion. There are two drugs containing misoprostol registered and available in Poland, one of which can be bought without the prescription. Women usually end up making up stories about stomach pain or rheumatic grandmothers to buy them. Sometimes both of them can be obtained from "under the counter", forums also advise to ask a man to help buy them. Misoprostol should be accompanied by mifepristone to increase effectiveness (the combination of both has 98% effectiveness, while only misoprostol alone is between 80-90%), but the latter drug is not registered in Poland. In this case organizations such as Women on Waves help to buy and ship them from other countries (they ask for donation of minimum of 70 euros, but they do support women in economic difficulties by providing them for free). It is well known that some of the doctors write prescriptions for these drugs (a pack of 12 costs 25 zl, but can be sold 10 or more times more expensive on the black market) and help women get access to them via advertisements. It's impossible to track as these drugs are not refunded by the state - therefore not registered anywhere. Due to lack of widespread support, some of the women organize support groups on online forums. They look for other women who seek abortions or just had one, share their stories and explain to each other what happens to their bodies, how to access drugs, if nausea is a normal reaction to pills, etc. As in some cases, pharmacological abortion can lead to prolonged bleeding and even death, they offer each other a call of support during the abortion, which takes up to a day. It's recommended to call for an ambulance in case of emergency - doctors cannot tell if the miscarriage was illegally inducted or not, and that save lives in some instances of home abortions. I am still reading some more about the abortion underground in Poland, and if I find some more interesting facts, I will updated this text. I also encourage you to share your stories on how women access abortion in countries with restrictive law. 
When it comes to social care, it is important to create links between the social movements, in a way they continuously support and feed back to each other, finding solutions that are creative, radical and practical at the same time.This is what is happening with a visionary project that is linking alternative and cooperative economy with the needs of refugees in Thessaloniki, Greece. It is a project of a group of people interested in the building of a cooperative economy network, in which I participate as an activist and a researcher of alternative economy. Having completed my PhD in economics in the last spring, I am now interested in continuing research, exploring links between solidarity economy and refugee solidarity movements in wider Greece. This cooperative project is called ‘Refugees to Refugees (R2R) Solidarity Call Center’ and it is a project run by refugees for fellow refugees. Its objective is to provide information and advice for various kinds of issues related to either transit, temporary stay or settlement of refugees in Thessaloniki, but also in wider Greece. At the same time, through its services, it hopes to create linkages between refugee communities and the wider solidarity movement, in order to break the exclusion and isolation that refugees are feeling, as a result of being crammed in concentration camps. Strong solidarity networks already exist within the cities, in which teams of lawyers, doctors, translators and networks of families offering hospitality in their homes, are offering voluntary support and practical solutions, whenever needed.The project is inspiring in its own right, but what makes it even more important and intriguing, is the fact that it is further linked with the efforts to create a new, fair and solidarity economy on a larger scale. Having such a vision, the group of refugees and solidary comrades that are supporting them on this, have built a collaborative network between the cooperative R2R call center and cooperative grocery stores in the area of Thessaloniki, where the refugee operators of the call center can cover most of their food and other basic needs, using a digital, alternative currency that is called Faircoin.The building of a network of alternative economy is being supported by FairCoop on a global level, and in the area of Thessaloniki it seems to be of special value as it can be directed to service needs of refugees. It is certainly not an easy task to achieve and it requires a lot of networking and cooperation, but already a cooperative store and collectives of producers are participating, while there is interest and plans for more to join very soon. What is also very important is that the cooperative stores participating in this network distribute high quality food products, produced by fellow cooperatives in Greece or imported through fair trade distributions channels.In Thessaloniki and more generally in Greece, there is currently a rise of the cooperative movement, especially as a result of the effects of the ongoing economic crisis, but unfortunately these new initiatives are up to now largely disconnected from each other. To create links between them, means to expand the spaces where solidarity is being practiced, in other words to fill the gaps with ever-increasing solidarity!My role in this project as an activist is to work closely with the group of refugees and locals to support the building of the project which requires a lot of work on communication and cooperation, in order to continue and expand successfully. As an independent researcher, I have presented the results of this ongoing project at a conference in Lesvos and hope to continue documenting its progress as well as to explore other similar initiatives in Greece.One last but very important point is that the funds for this ambitious project are being raised through an international campaign of crowdfunding in both euros and faircoins, which are being used to cover incomes of the refugees working in the project and their home rent. Being a cooperative initiative, this means that all the incomes are being equally distributed among the members, currently four in number, three men from Gambia, Egypt and Morocco, and a woman from Syria.If you would like to support the R2R solidarity call center and at the same time help expand the bridges between the refugee solidarity movement and the solidarity economy movement, please consider to donate using our ‘coopfunding’ platform or share about the project with your solidarity networks! If you work with refugees in Greece or other countries, interested in the call center’s services or interested in building similar initiatives in the countries where they live, please share the phone line’s number and communication e-mail!Photo credits: Maria Orfanou Call center tel: 0030 23111 80903 E-mail: Greece@callcenter.coopWeb: Callcenter.coopFacebook: Refugees to Refugees R2R Solidarity Call Center              
Where do young people go to when they grief? Do they cry alone in their bedrooms? Do they logon to the internet? How do young people in grief find each other? Do they phone a friend? Do they enter a counselling centre? Do they search through hashtags and websites?Death has never been more public than in the age of the internet. Alongside waves of #RIP[insertcelebrity] tributes and #[nameofvictim] police shooting activism proliferating on social media are viral posts of everyday people approaching grief and documenting their experience on the internet: recounting a person’s final days, parting words and gratitude from the deathbed, captures of assisted suicide and “right to die parties”, and families commemorating the deceased.These experiences of death and loss have been augmented and prolonged with the growth of social media use. More specifically, the ways in which a social media platform is structured and the dominant culture of its users has allowed people in grief to process their loss in innovative ways – new spaces of affect are created, new paralanguage vocabularies are innovated, and new transient networks of care are formulated.Research has emerged in various disciplines focusing on internet memorial pages (in which the deceased and/or their funeral is commemorated on a public page), digital altars and graves (in which the living pay respects to the dead via technological mediations), afterlife digital estate management (in which the transfer and privacy of internet artifacts belonging to the deceased are negotiated), and even RIP trolling (in which trolls hijack Facebook memorial pages with abusive content). There is even an academic journal and a handful of institutes dedicated to “Death Studies”.For instance, monuments.com enables clients to personalize cemetery headstones with a QR code. By scanning the QR code with a smartphone, users are led to an interactive website where they may upload images and text of well wishes to the deceased and their family, or contribute to building their family heritage through stories or family trees. Users are also able to re-share their post on more mainstream social media.As an anthropologist and ethnographer of digital culture, I have a comprehensive understanding of such practices. But when my younger sister passed away earlier this year, the ways in which her friends expressed and managed their grief in digital spaces led me to discover a rich repertoire of coping mechanisms, exchange of affect, and mutual aftercare in a vernacular created by young people who grew up with the internet - these really moved my heart and encouraged me to examine young people and grief in digital spaces.But just what is mutual aftercare? Often after a global grieving event such as large-scale natural disasters or spates of violence, strangers would gather in public spaces that transform into transient sites of solidarity. With candles, flowers, and written tributes in tow, strangers come together to process their grief, share their grief, and lend support to those in grief. Bodies who are not familiar with each other are motivated by the immediate, tangible, and tactile presence of other bodies in an enclosed space to disperse emotions they would usually restraint, and dispense care they would usually withhold when the group’s motivations are briefly aligned. Sociologist Emile Durkheim refers to this as “collective effervescence”. This is ‘aftercare’, or the care one offers to others after a hurtful experience. When people come together to publicly acknowledge their pain and simultaneously offer care and concern to fellow others in pain, this becomes a network of ‘mutual aftercare’. Young people seem to be doing similar things in digital spaces, and I wanted to find out how.*Being a young person in my mid-twenties for whom the internet and social media is second nature, I seamlessly took to my blog to make sense of my grief and loss. I wrote about my experiences of “holding space” for my sister in her final days (see also Heather Plett), and about learning to declutter physical artifacts despite my abstract emotional attachment to these things. I also wrote about how I felt when Facebook friends began “deep-liking” my old posts on grief and how it impeded my progress and recovery. As much as I felt hurt and disappointed by these peers, I could not justify my anger knowing that digital etiquette is not universal – knowing how to approach someone in grief on social media or how to express grief on social media is not actually “common sense”. Digital etiquette varies across personal beliefs and cultural norms, and is highly dependent on the context of interpersonal relationships and the norms of a social media platform. In other words, digital etiquette surrounding grief has to be taught, learnt, and practiced.I was both a young person managing grief in digital spaces and an ethnographer invested in understanding everyday practices through intimate anthropological inquiry. To do this, I conducted personal interviews with young people who self-reported using digital media (i.e. the internet, social media, devices and artifacts, non-analogue spaces) to manage their grief. I started with friends in my sister’s social groups, made open calls to undergraduates in local universities, and amassed informants via snowball sampling.I wanted to understand what young people did on the internet to recover and how this differed from analogue coping mechanisms pre-social media. I wanted to learn how they constructed solidarity, conveyed empathy, and maintained networks of mutual aftercare. Some also showed me their smartphone apps so that I could study how they crafted content, ranging from emotive Instagram captions of meaningful photographs to extensive digital catalogues of every tactile item the deceased has ever touched.I learnt that a vocabulary of grief was quietly emerging among young people. For instance, emoji and emoticons were especially significant as a paralanguage. Some reported that “when words fail”, or when they “had no strength” to craft responses back to friends who had sent them condolences, they would mobilize emoji or emoticons to acknowledge receipt, demonstrate reciprocity, or express gratitude. One person who had lost his father to a critical illness said that while “the adults” in his family did not seem to articulate their grief and loss to each other (“they strictly never said anything about it in the house”), those in his generation such as his cousins took to Facebook to comfort each other via status updates and follow-up comments. Another young person began a groupchat on the messaging app WhatsApp and recruited friends of the deceased from all walks of life into the chat. They used the groupchat as a semi-private outlet to share their thoughts without having to worry about self-censorship – many of them felt Facebook was “too public”, that email was “too impersonal”, and that meeting in person was “too soon”, “too painful”, or “too awkward”. As such, the space of a groupchat accorded them the freedom to process grief more transparently among empathetic others in a safe space; the groupchat became a space of mutual aftercare.*The need to understand young people’s grief in digital spaces became clearer to me as I began consulting and conversing with healthcare professionals in palliative care. One hospice nurse expressed that as a patient approaches their end of life, most family members would single-heartedly focus all their effort and affect on that one person. Upon the death of their loved one, many people are suddenly hit with grief all at once and are unable to transit into care for each other, or “care for the living”. In other words, despite social workers and counsellors preaching the value of “care chains”, many people who are deep in grief simply do not have the mental capacity and physical resources to plan for self-care or mutual aftercare.Another doctor reported seeing an increasing number of young patients in their late teens or early-to-mid twenties. Sorrowfully recounting a memorable incident in which her young patient instructed her to post a specifically-worded status update on his Facebook after death, she came to realize that young people deeply valued their digital estates as platforms to communicate gratitude and farewells even on their deathbed. In a handful of other instances, young patients requested for their doctors and counsellors to add them on Facebook or to read their blog in order to access sentiment they felt incapable of articulating in person, in physical spaces, via traditional mediaDespite the very crucial work that such palliative staff engage in, much of this work is negotiated ad hoc on-the-go as they “play by ear”. Most staff do “what feels right” based on their individual relationships with their patients, or on their personal concepts of etiquette and ethics. In other words, once we have a better understanding of how young people grief in digital spaces, palliative healthcare workers can be equipped to guide their young patients and clients using their preferred coping mechanisms, devices, and vocabulary. To a generation for whom death and grief are increasingly public spectacles, such care will be crucial to preserving the mental well being of cohorts to come.*Have you ever commemorated the death of a loved one in digital spaces? What did you do? How did others respond to you?Whenever you witness someone sharing their grief on social media, how do you feel? Does it motivate you to respond to the person in particular ways?How can we use social media more conscientiously so as to create spaces for mutual aftercare? What can we do for each other in digital spaces whenever a global grieving event occurs?We would love to hear from you.*This article was written by Dr Crystal Abidin for OpenCare Research, Edgeryders. Crystal can be contacted at wishcrys.com. The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
Hello open carers and community,This is to let you know we have our next cohort of Op3n Fellows, members on Edgeryders who have accepted to expand their work into a piece to be sent in for community review, then to be uploaded here and shared broadly with the Internets.Before introducing them, we’re on the lookout for a few more Edgeryders willing to up their writing skills and publish a story of care by mid November. If you’ve been active here and could use the Fellowship rewards, get in touch below and I’m sure we can sort it out!@Aravella Salonikidou is one of the most active members from Greece who came on board with the occasion of our collective funding application on OpenandChange. She talked about she “started this initiative of collecting and filling backpacks with first need items for refugees”, and how that went on to engage thousands of volunteers. She also connected with numerous Edgeryders since then, engaging with their stories and showing up to the twitter conference we held a few weeks back. Meet and greet Aravella here.Steve @steelweaver is an acupuncturist, facilitator and natural health consultant currently living in Devon in the South-West of the United Kingdom. He graduated from acupuncture college in 2012 and has since worked in single- and multi-bed practices in London, Dartmoor, India and Guatemala. He is in the process of setting up his own low-cost community clinic in Tiverton, Devon. In a time when the future of mainstream healthcare is uncertain, amid concerns about its financial and environmental sustainability, its dangers and side-effects, and the disempowering nature of its provision, Steve believes that the low-cost, low-impact form of community healthcare derived from Traditional East Asian Medicine offers an important alternative paradigm; one that promotes health rather than just treating sickness, and empowers individual and communities to improve and maintain their own well-being. Read more.Crystal @wishcrys has been lurking around OpenCare ever since we started - she is an anthropologist slash ethnographer currently based in Singapore and with a damn original research interest: young people and peer support during times of grief manifested in the digital realm in the most contemporary ways i.e. through facebook “deep liking” ?! (I first read about that from Crystal). Until she publishes her piece, you can ask her more about this here. Anthony @dfko’s story about OpenInsulin encapsulates the very core spirit of OpenCare - the team are bootstrapping the production of a core insulin component and trying to draw the attention of manufacturers who would then expand this into new markets in less developed areas. The key insight is in how Open Insulin shows that open science can provide for those whose needs aren't met by existing institutions. Kudos for the project and offers to help are here, so head over.@Thom Stewart is someone who builds networks gracefully and understands working together. His care initiative is called Cosain and lives in Galway - and it using cultural resources to provide peer wellness support, including existing infrastructure re-deployed for its activities (the Galway City Museum). Cosain’s applications in public health are numerous, and more than being a community project, it is a partnership between groups on the ground and the Mental Health Services Consumer Panel. Check it out for yourself here.Finally, @Jenny Gkiougki is currently mapping food systems in Greece, from legitimized cooperatives to completely informal groups: “I would like to encourage Greek people to be more involved in the procedure of the Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market or get involved in complex food chains”. Jenny’s different areas of interest are described here, and I’m hoping in her upcoming post she will zoom into just one and satisfy our curiosity.
Hello, We are Lotfi and Selvi, a couple of engaged people with an eclectic cultural background. We opened an elderly home twenty years ago, but stopped a couple of years ago because the field wasn't interesting anymore. Now  we are active on all kind of different levels inside healthcare organizations but we still have a dream to realise a new way of looking at elderly care. We come from different backgrounds from Africa, mixed cultures, and saw how they treat their elderly within the community. We lost that touch with our elderly here in the west, we use the homes a place to bring the elderly, but we we forget they are viable resources for the development of our society. Their knowledge, their experience is a vital organe for society. So why not build more inclusivly we tought?That is where we started thinking about a mini city where the elderly home would be in the center, but where families, schools, shops could intertwine with the daily practice of the elderly. Having elderly people in your surroundings is great for the development of a local neighborhood so why don't we finance more project with that in mind?For me it is partially because the politics isn't ready in Belgium to start this discussion. People started to have the idea it is ok to bring your elderly to a home, so why brutally change it? But for me it is something politics need to invest now, to experiment and learn about these new methods so we can prepare the future, where the elderly will even be an even bigger number of people if we follow the population piramde of Western countries. I would love to find out if other projects around the world are looking at the same problem, and using more design solutions to reconnect the elderly and their homes with the other generations.   
Loic made a paper to analyse squat spaces that are more then meets the eye. In his conclussion he goes deeper in the possibilities of this kind of habitat."Dans le contexte actuel de crise aigue du logement et en considération du taux de vacance des immeubles bruxellois il nous parait manifeste que les projets d’occupation par l’habitat solidaire, tels que celui du « 123 rue royale », sont une réponse viable et durable.Elle est inclusive : personne n’est exclu d’emblée, les personnes rencontrées attestent d’une réelle mixité sociale, économique et culturelle. Plus qu’un toit elle offre à ses habitants une structure physique et sociale où s’épanouir. De plus elle a le mérite de répondre à ces deux problèmes fondamentaux à Bruxelles. Les activités au rez-de-chaussée créent une vie de quartier évitant toute ghettoïsation.Les ateliers permettent aux habitants d’apprendre, développer ou partager leurs connaissances et leur savoir-faire. Bien que la vie dans une communauté telle que celle du «123» peut devenir éprouvante par moments, elle permet d’éviter l’isolement des habitants les plus vulnérables et permet à ceux qui ne se retrouvent pas dans les solutions conventionnelles un moyen d'explorer de nouvelles pistes pour l'habiter en ville. Une médiation permanente des conflits qui apparaissent inexorablement dans une communauté aussi importante est nécessaire et figure parmi les conditions indispensables de réussite de ce genre d'expérience. Ainsi ces bénéfices se font au coût d’une gestion rigoureuse et d’une énergie considérable à déployer quotidiennement par les habitants pour la communauté. Nous avons réalisé à quel point l’inclusion des usagers d'un habitat est importante pour réussir un projet de logement, Le mouvement semble néanmoins en marche et l’association logements123 wonen a commence à transposer l’expérience à d’autres batiments avec d’autres habitants.Ceci en tirant parti des leçons apprises au 123, ainsi qu’au tagawa et au Gésu. Malgré le statut temporaire et incertain de l’occupation, il semblerait que plus que le béton du bâtiment, ce sont les habitants qui portent le projet du «123». «(…) les logements alternatifs ne sont pas abordables parce que l’ensemble des exigences qui y sont liées ne correspondent ni aux réalités qu’ils vivent, ni à leurs moyens (coût des matériaux, accès aux primes, confrontation aux normes de salubrité, sécurité, urbanisme…). Ce que les plus pauvres construisent au quotidien, ce sont des alternatives au logement, pour se garantir un habitat qui soit abordable financièrement et dont ils auront la maitrise» 57 ainsi que les l’importance des gains de la mutualisation de fonctions communes. Ces gains ne se chiffrent pas qu’en mètres carrés, mais surtout en contacts sociaux quotidiens, un partage des ressources et une économie en énergie. Ce modèle n’est néanmoins pas sans limitations. On peut craindre avec l’accroissement de la popularité du projet une gentrification des habitants. Aussi la liste d’attente pour trouver une place, même si moins longue que pour un logement social est là pour rappeler que l’occupation d’un seul bâtiment n’est pas une solution exhaustive au manque de logement. La nature urgente de la question du logement à Bruxelles demande un engagement des pouvoirs public dans une politique de favorisation de telles initiatives.Ceci en adaptant le cadre légal et en informant les propriétaires sur les avantages de telles initiatives. Ce travail nous permet de dégager trois points primordiaux pour le mise en place réussie de ce genre d'initiative:- L'implication active et quotidienne des habitants dans un projet commun.- La collaboration et l'information des propriétaires de bâtiments vides- La permissivité ou l'encadrement par les authorités."You can find the complete publication here: www.academia.edu/16771654/LE_DROIT_à_LHABITAT_PAR_LOCCUPATION123 was a previously office building occupied by the French community which had been vacant for 15 years. Groups of squatters moved in and made a deal with the owner to run different workshops - bike fixing, woodwork, IT etc.Some interesting facts from his paper:-social housing in Bxl is much lower, 7 % compared to the 27% in the Netherlands-7 % of houses totally empty-1 000 000 sq metres of unused office space: 40% of empty offices have been empty for 7 yearsFrom squatting to a participatory process -  a public owned space (Community Francais) but community managed: from refugees to Irish artists to Flemish doctor students. Half the people (of 60) don't have any revenues, and everyone contributes a little - from 60 eur a month to approx. 150.  In Belgium it is possible to have a temporary legal occupation for an office, so you can live in an office space!It's an office building, which means people can change the layout easily. This makes it an interesting testcase for architects that are experimenting with commun space. The big difference between buildings for profit and the testcase of 123:Profit building is praised for being open while just having 7% of their space being used for community. 123 has almost 50% of community used space, but because of their 'illegal' status it isn't praised. Loic showed a detailed distribution of the types of spaces - at each floor you'd have facilities, workshops, library + distribution of private and communal space.  Important detail: Stairs are used instead of working elevators as a social control mechanism. Loic is trying to give more visibility to housing solutions - it's not easy, he says, and it's important to make good contact with the owner! "First you squat, then you talk" is his moto. He wants to continue researching these kinds of houses. You can contact him through mail: loicdesiron@gmail.com
Full story: http://digg.com/2016/women-on-webTL;drAccording to WHO, 19 to 20 million unsafe abortions are performed every year (source)Rebecca Gompert served as the doctor of the good ship Rainbow Warrior. Impressed by the idea of a "pirate ship" defying legality for a good cause, she later started a clinic on a ship, Aurora, in 2001. It provided safe abortion, performed by qualifiied doctors and nurses, to places where abortion was outlawed (Ireland, Poland, Spain, Portugal and Morocco). This service (Women On Waves) later moved to the web. Women on Web starts with an online consultation following WHO protocol. Once risks are deemed negligible, women are mailed medical abortion pills (Mifepristone and Misoprostol ), a very safe procedure. 20 staff answer 10,000 monthly emails anonymously and within 24 hours. There is also a peer-to-peer element, like the I had an abortion section of the website.Many difficulties remain, including customs. They are, however, being hacked.My own reflection: once again, when people need something they are going to get it for themselves. Anyone wants to investigate this further? @Natalia Skoczylas maybe?
[Curator's note] Alkasem was a doctor student in Syria, but had to flee the country for obvious reasons. He studied for four years at the university, but on arriving here he couldn’t continue his studies because of his status of refugee in Europe. Still he came to the workshop in Brussels and we are all really thankful for his disruptive thinking and propositions that helped us think out of the box and see our Western society from another perspective.About alternatives to our healthcare system: In Syria we have an ‘islamic solidarity’ in society that creates a kind of health system without organization, like you have to give a part of your money to the poor, you have social care system that is organized by the people itself. If you haven’t fastened for one day, you have to give food to 64 people. Every doctor works one day a week for free. That is how we can survive under a dictatorship.  We are already prepared for any kind of chaos, it is made for any kind of situation and is part of our cultural heritage.I want to see the whole of society as one body, but here everybody lives in his box, I call this "boxpeople". You live together but you don’t really live together. You are online, but not connected, we have to discuss, to see each other more. This is my new society, so i want to care as much about this now then how I cared about my society in Syria. For exemple the old people are separated from the rest of the adults, they don’t have a connection. Why do you do that? We don’t talk about generational society, we don’t attach value to the older people here and that makes me worry. I hear a lot about that here we work a lot about societal diversity, but not generational diversityAbout people sleeping in the streets:One of the first things I noticed in Brussels is that a lot of people are living in the streets. Why are they living in the streets, don’t they have families to take care of them? Where are the families of the homeless people? I never saw anyone homeless in Syria, or living on a mattress. How did it happen?Some of the participants responded later on: the core family concept has been broken down - after uni and growing up you have to support yourself; so there is no glue which keeps family togetherin North Africa systems are weak - so there has always been a cultural support; whereas in the West the system is supposed to take care of everything"Free, but alone." vs. "Belonging, but coerced" Comparing systems-based  vs. family-based cultures of care (twitter link)About trustEverything moves around friendship. I have the feeling that a lot of people in western society start of with mistrust. If you start with mistrust it is difficult to create trust. And without trust no skill can be shared. How can we create a better health system if we need all kind of difficult systems to create the trust that isn’t there really.In less then one day, Alkasem showed us that the things we find sometimes really obvious aren’t at all for everybody. He inpacted a lot of the discussions with his point of views and made it obvious that sometimes we are still a bit too etnocentric about the way we want to design solutions. Having completly different cultural heritages at the table makes a discussions so much richer. 
For this second tool (Tool 1) i want to come back to the end discussion of the Brussels workshop we held on 24th of September. Alkasem, a doctorstudent and Syrian Refugee started a really important conversation about collaboration: how can we collaborate if there is no trust? Lets go back to this conversation and look at what came out of itCitation from the workshop: SIDENOTE 2: Alkasem was again the most disruptive thinker in the group and gave us a lot to think. For him, everything moves around friendship. He has the feeling that a lot of people in western society start of with mistrust. If you start with mistrust it is difficult to create trust. And without trust no skill can be shared. This intervention of him started a discussion about the meaning of trust and how we can build that.“‘Trust is an enabler to use the resources. How can that be created inside an eclectic group like this?’,asked Yannick.  For Claire it is a text and rules of engagement and a clear path of conflict resolution, and a way to learn to treat each other better. Winnie reacted that your own people's trust is a constant, but gaining the network's trust is more difficult.With the help of Nadia we made a synthesis of the discussion1) Working trust is very different from social trust; and there needs to be a boundary. 2) What also worked for her is deciding to work on even a small project.3) A story that binds us together - understanding how our different activities are related4) Documentation: what does it mean? for us it has been in writing.Finding each other strengths and weaknesses by organizing small events with each other, and beginning with things that don't have something big at stake. Because then we can learn about each other. The importance of documentation in building trust: Leaving a story behind that people can follow.When the discussion was coming to an end we all felt we had got a lot of information and the workshop was going to close. So Nadia came up with a good idea to end the workshop with something concrete. We all felt that one of the biggest issues in care is that we live to much on our own island and that if we want to make care better we need to share and collaborate. But to collaborate we need to create trust. So this exercise was given to every participant and will hopefully end up in solidifying the care network in Belgium. The following question was asked:What can i bring to another organization, that also better myself as a person and is easily realizable?This question will be asked again at the next meeting we are organizing. If you want to join, fill in the framadate and put your contacts in comment. We will update this discussion at that point and see how we have concretized the thrust issue.https://framadate.org/gWB9QN65MCyedmrL  
Réseaux Solidaires is a new organization in Brussels that is working around a direct approach towards less exclusion for people that have social, medical or therapeutical problems. They aren’t online creating a community and platform but rather in the streets and at each others home. Because the thing that differences this organization and others is that every member is at the same time care giver and care taker. What they want to create is a feeling of comprehension toward each other and toward the external world. With their discussions and events they create empowerment for the people inside the platform. At the Brussels workshop of OpenAndCare two of them where participating. This is their story:Claire:  Le projet Réseaux solidaires veut lutter contre les ruptures sociales, voire médicales et thérapeutiques. On veut développer l’entraide et l’empowerment. On a commencé début août un atelier, ouvert à tous (nous sommes aujourd’hui 4), sur le capitalisme et le néo-capitalisme, avec un accent particulier sur les exclus du système qui, en privilégiant la concurrence, en laisse beaucoup sur la touche. Une journée de rencontre sur ce thème est prévue en décembre 2016, réunissant des malades (en santé mentale ou pas), des allocataires sociaux, des sympathisants de la cause des exclus. Une première étape sera le développement d’un volontariat axé sur la fonction, entre autres, d’aidant proche. Mais la personne aidée sera aussi actrice. L’axe formation, écoute, non-jugement sera très important. Lutter contre les ruptures sociales. Volontariat autour de l’aidant proche.What I want to do ?Building bridges. Mixing people together fragile or disabled people and learn how to help each other. I struggle in many organization which I felt didn’t had the good comprehension of social situations. Start things by a good understanding is the key for me. I NEED to create real interaction within social world. I come from a personal fragile life where I have an orphan sickness and I don’t have any family anymore. When I was having health issues I wasn’t taken serious by the hospital, and because I was alone it was difficult to find the energy to prove my sickness. I want a network where people like me can feel save but also feel useful to other people by telling their story and sharing their thoughts. Instead of finding healthy people to help unhealthy people, why not find people with likewise problems to help each other. It isn’t easy at all, but it would be a step forward if such a network could exist.These are the values where she wants to work around: solidarity, sharing & transmission of knowledge & resources. The basic for her is that we create a place where the people listen to each other, because there is for her the key. If we create that base, the rest is possible for her.‘Avant tous était fait par les parents, famille, maintenant c’est les aide social, mais c’est pas le meilleur modèle, on doit reprendre cette responsabilité. ‘Jean:Is also a member of the association “réseaux solidaires” : a group to help people with mental health issues and who are isolated from society There’s no website he says, everything is person related. He is a member because he is sick himself.He is interested by the collaborative systems, how they work without any incomes and business revenu model and capitalism structures. Within the social sector, he wants to have more perspective about this new system. A thought: a basic income could sustain the collaborative economy…He’s looking for contacts, an informatician who can create a friendly and intuitive website, easy to use, but also to make known the initiative  “Réseaux solidaires” to other mentally ill patients, and to raise the awareness about the subject.If you have any ideas you can contact Claire (andreclaire21@yahoo.fr) in French and Jean (duckkington58@yahoo.fr) in English or French.
 This two part evaluation exercise is a follow up on the most discussed topic in our Brussels Workshop. We talked most of the day about collaboration and how we want to find better ways to create fruitful coaction. If we want to be abble to work together inside our value system, we need to understand how we work. If fruitful collaboration means working togheter while feeling good towards each other in a mutual environment of respect, these two thought bubbles could be for you.This article is a more personal post that came to mind after evaluating my own participation in two projects and how horizontal organizations can play mind tricks to your own involvement.Modern organizations, starting as a local and small group of people tend to go fast in an horizontal or flat organization structure. People are seen as equal and every role is important, it helps to feel involved, and makes the range of possibilities bigger. But without a leader the group misses sometimes direction and efficiency is less visible. Roles are then distributed and somebody becomes head of design, head of funds or head of communication. Productivity is flowing again, but for me a subtler barrier is still in the way. From idea to task you still need preparation, and that is something I’m completely lacking of.You could argument that everybody needs to do his part of preparation, and you can’t only be the philosopher, but I lean to see a collective as an ecosystem where each other strengths are put up front and we organize ourselves around this.Often I tend to fill the gaps as soon as I see them. If something practical isn’t been taken care of I jump to do it, because I’m good at last minute problem solving, but with my lack of preparation skills, if it is to much in amount it take all my energy and i’m doomed to fail, followed by personal and collective frustration.The Thinkers, the Preppers and the DoersSo instead of blocking on my personal incompetence, I try to solve it by what I like doing: systemical thinking. I categorize all work inside an organization in three categories that flow in each other: Thinking, preparing and doing.Visualize your own strengths and weaknesses as a finite set of skill points like in a video game. In your short or long-lived life you earned skill points through events and big moments. You gathered your knowledge into one of those categories and how more you collect how more you can handle in that category, but other way around: tackling tasks inside a category you aren’t good is time and energy consuming with an inefficient consequence as a a result.Unless you are a superhuman that can do everything alone, in an organization it is rather intelligent to search for each other complementary skills. A thinker with a lot of energy to give to do will need a preparation master as his right hand. How bigger the group how more difficult it is to find a balance, but have five thinkers and one prepper you will never get the job done.The big difference with a vertical organization is that in a flat organization those three categories aren’t intended. Where you have specific roles inside a hierarchical organization build around power the thinker will always be above the prepper that will be above the doer. When you see everybody as equal we try to divide also the categories equal, but there is the catch: not a lot of people have throughout their lifetime chosen to equally distribute their skill points.What we need is better understanding about this kind of dynamic. Knowing this I’m intended to take lesser practical mid-long tasks and preparative tasks on me cause I never trained myself and communicate it with my teammates to see how we can find a better dynamic inside the collective. On the other side, give me a task, well explained that takes a certain amount of time, even repetitive, I’m your guy.
Ce texte est une pastiche qui n'a jamais été publié suite au faite que le jour de publication était le jour des attentat en France. J'ai rencontré Yannick qui m'a proposé de partager ce texte ici, car comme d'autre idée la réappropriation de l'espace commun a comme bénéfice des gens plus sain d'esprit dans la ville. Voici notre proposition: Une nouvelle Maison du Peuple!Aujourd’hui est un jour historique pour Bruxelles. Après de longs mois d’incertitude, le conseil communal à enfin tranché: le Palais de la Bourse deviendra le lieu commun de tous les bruxellois. Ils ont à nouveau une Maison du Peuple!Ce temple architectural est évidemment d’abord un choix symbolique. Après y avoir accepté la très controversée exposition Behind The Numbers glorifiant le néo-liberalisme, la Ville s’est rendue compte qu’il fallait donner une autre destination à cet endroit que celle de pure spéculation commerciale et d'activité touristique. En transformant une partie de la Bourse en Maison du Peuple elle redonne une place aux Bruxellois au cœur du centre historique!Donnez la ville aux habitants, et tout le monde s’en portera mieuxOn ne comptait plus le nombre d’actions contre les plans de la Ville: plates-formes citoyennes, regroupements de commerçants, actions ludiques diverses... Qui ne se souvient du banc de 30 m déposé au milieu de la Grand place, ou des centaines de gens pique-niquant place de la Bourse, de l'action de revendication des escaliers de la Bourse comme tribune libre d'expression politique lors du KunstenFestivaldesarts? L’espace public était devenu un haut lieu de débat, mais paradoxalement ne recevait pas d’endroit adéquat pour le mener (une Agora). La participation ne remuait que du vent, les riverains ne se sentaient pas entendus. La ville était taillée sur mesure pour les eurocrates, les touristes Chinois, avec commerces ouverts le dimanche, tandis que le Bruxellois devait se contenter d’une ville certes prestigieuse, mais sans lieu où il fait bon vivre, une ville d'expériences individuelles juxtaposées, atomisées, sans liens.Le Beer Tempel projeté dans le Palais de la Bourse aura une entrée par l’arrière, et c'est très bien ainsi. Mais sans occuper tout l'espace, il comprendra une nouvelle Maison du Peuple, où chacun pourrait débattre de ce qui se passe dans la ville, où les initiatives bottom-up pourront croître, de nouvelles idées pour une ville meilleure surgir. Il importe de faire de ce lieu symbolique qu'est la Bourse un espace de libre débat, une Agora. Il s'agit de rendre la ville aux habitants pour que tout le monde en profite, pour que l’habitant s’y sente bien. Alors le touriste, le commerçant et tout les autres s'y sentiront bien aussi.La Ville espère avec cette Maison du Peuple calmer les tensions palpables par le biais d’une communication plus ouverte: un endroit de rencontre et d’écoute sera ainsi aménagé dans le bâtiment. En revitalisant de cette façon la Bourse, en lui donnant une échelle humaine, la Ville aide à fabriquer le tissu social des prochaines décennies. Bien sûr, le touriste y aura sa place, car la Maison du peuple sera ouverte a tous. Mais nous ne voulons pas que la centralité habitée soit confisquée par une vitrine à touristes. A la Maison du Peuple, les touristes pourraient rencontrer des Bruxellois, trouver des bons plans pour une visite de Bruxelles vue par ses habitants, trouver le plaisir culturel de ville plus qu'une consommation grégaire.Utopie et Réalité? Et maintenant vient la chute: on est encore bien loin de cette possible utopie à Bruxelles et c’est bien dommage. On dirait que la peur panique du désordre social jette la Ville dans les bras de la société du spectacle, attractive aux investisseurs, par la privatisation de l’espace public, le non-débat constant avec les acteurs locaux, un trafic encore plus monstrueux, et de plus en plus de gens en désaccord avec chacun mais encore plus avec la politique bruxelloise...Une souffle nouveau, un bref moment d’air frais pourrait nous sortir de là, donc amis Bruxellois, politiciens donnez-nous cette Maison du Peuple à la Bourse. Sinon on la prendra! ;-)  
A couple of years ago i participated to a contest called ‘5 voor 13’ that gave people the challenge to find through use of new technology solutions for healthcare problems. It was organized C-Mine Genk, an innovation laboratory in the old coalmines of the Flemish region of Limburg. I got selected as one of the finalist for my solution for a solution for the intergenerational gab, commonly known as the kids that don’t visit grandma anymore because she is to old…For my solution I started by looking at the obvious part: intergenerational contact is good for the health of the elderly and also good for the development of the kids on multiple levels. So what was missing is a tool that brought them together.I grew up in a rather unconventional setting for people of my generation and later (90s kids like the internet would say) My parents and i shared the house with an elderly woman that wasn’t my grandmother but the godmother of my dad. She was rather cultivated woman with brought knowledge about geography, literature and history. She helped me out on my schoolwork and we shared our interest in reading the news. When she started having difficulties to move out of the house, I helped her staying young by introducing her to the then new technology called DVD and PS2. We played bowling on the Wii and if she would have stayed around longer, I’m sure she would have used my tablet. In opposite to my grandmother who was visiting us every week, my ‘mémé’ stayed young in her head, and i think it was patly thanks to our dayle exchanges. She would learn me about history and i would learn her about technology. So when designing my idea i took this story and tried to create the mechanisms that made it work and what was needed to scale up. I found that people where already implementing wii’s in elderly homes to give them exercise. While this is a good idea for them to exercise, the intergenerational part was still missing. So how could we create a game where kids needed to come to the elderly without them having the feeling it was a burden?Well you know those games on your phone where you need to do repetitive tasks to go up levels to beat new monsters, like 99% of all mechanics of Role Playing Games? Why not extrude those mechanics of training to the elderly. Give them exercises they can do all day to gain skill points. Arm movements will help the Atk stat for example, Balance will help Def stat and so on. The twist is that the kids playing the game will need to go physically to the elderly to get their little guy leveed up. Want to beat a new boss, but you miss some skillpoint, well go to one of the elderly homes where they play the game and go talk with them. Maybe the first time the discussion will be pure mechanical, but when returning a bound will be created between the people and discussions will be about more then only the game. You have to see it as an incentive to bring people together.After presenting this project i finished third and got 500 euro’s to spend on material for the project. At that time i was even less into the entrepreneurs world and i failed to continue this project.  I still think there are some logics and mechanisms that could be interested to work out. Anybody that is willing to use this is free to do anything with it, as long as he gives me a sign about it. It would be awesome to prototype it.
Paramount California University is one of the top education providers in the state. We believe in providing the highest quality education to all our students. Paramount California University website provides all the details regarding the courses that we offer to our students. It ranges widely from associate degrees to masters degrees, diplomas and other short courses. These courses and degrees are designed to prepare our students to get a firm grip over their respective fields of study and to efficiently tackle all the problems that they encounter.Paramount California University ranking is slowly and gradually improving each year because we have stuck to our ambition to maintaining a high standard of education that we strive to provide to our students. We have also made sure that al courses and degrees are reviewed and updated on a regular basis so that it reflects the latest and up to date changes in their respective fields. One of the biggest benefit of pursuing the degrees and courses with us is that we employ highly qualified and professional teaching staff and faculty. All our faculty members have vast experience in the practical fields of education and are experienced enough to understand the nature of each student and help them to realize their educational goals.Not only does we provide on campus classes to students. We also a dedicated online and distance learning program on offer. This program is designed for those who wish to pursue their degrees with us but cannot attend our classes or campuses for different reasons. Through our online and distance learning program, they can enroll in these courses and have the benefit of getting the same quality of education that we provide to students who attend our campuses. The studies are conducted through correspondence and students can study at a time of their own convenience. Paramount California University ranking with regards to its online courses is highly respected and getting better by the time.We realize the fact that our university is a learning ground for students and people from several different nationalities, casts, cultures and ethnicities.

We respect the value and tradition of all our students and strive to provide them with an environment where they feel free to showcase their skills and talents. We also learn a lot from these students and their cultures. Paramount California University ranking has been boosted because of the fact that it is a preferred learning provider for students from all across the globe.Our institution also focuses on the fact that students need to concentrate on their co-curricular activities along with their studies. We encourage our students to take an active part in activities other than their studies. This helps them to divert their attention from studies and focus on another side of their learning which is to learn how to keep their body fit and how to showcase their skills in other activities. It also teaches them to learn the sportsman spirit of the game along with having a good team spirit and respecting the rules of the game.There are a lot of great things about our students and graduates that make them a preferred choice of employers once they enter the practical fields of life. Employers realize the fact that along with being highly qualified, our students are well groomed, well-mannered and are extremely capable of taking the organization forward with their hard work, dedication and vision.         
The problem that we are tackling with Brilliance is the fact that over six million babies requiring treatment for severe jaundice each year are not receiving the treatment they need. One of the main reasons for this is a lack of access to affordable devices that provide phototherapy, the standard treatment for severe jaundice. By introducing a low-cost, high-quality phototherapy device to the global market, we aim to increase the number of babies receiving treatment who otherwise would not have been treated effectively, and thereby, reduce the number of deaths and disabilities due to untreated severe jaundice.Health sensing through smartphones has received considerable attention in recent years because of the devices’ ubiquity and promise to lower the barrier for tracking medical conditions. In this paper, we focus on using smartphones to monitor newborn jaundice, which manifests as a yellow discoloration of the skin. Although a degree of jaundice is common in healthy newborns, early detection of extreme jaundice is essential to prevent permanent brain damage or death. Current detection techniques, however, require clinical tests with blood samples or other specialized equipment. Consequently, newborns often depend on visual assessments of their skin color at home, which is known to be unreliable.Sketch 1 - To explain the IdeaSketch 2 - Concept Storyboard
The basic idea was to create a prototype consisted of two already invented tangible objects. The eyeglasses which give you the possibility to focus by moving the lances and the one that measures your myopia and presbyopia using the size of your retina. The basic idea was to implement one to another and using an algorithm with the application on your phone you  could measure firstly your problem and afterwards adjust the focus depending on the measurements and making your eyesight perfect  almost all the time. The eye sight becomes blurry as years go by and everyone gets older. The technology is simple as you can just focus manually too the lens either if you are trying to read a book for a long time and your eyes are focused on close objects. Using the adjustor the two lens move or slide so they come to a point where they totally focus with the poins of myopia or presbyopia you might have and you can see clearly.The concept of the application was easier as it enables you to measure the points while you are focusing the glasses yourself. This gives you an idea of the size of your problem without necessary have to go to a doctor.
Recruiting people for testing a hybrid bicycle (see here), personal experiences were confirmed: mother nature gives us ideal conditions (Milano, Italy) such as sun, no wind and flat terrain. We are however trapped because private motor transport rules the roads and scares us. Are you a wheelchair user, mother/father with baby carriage, cyclist or pedestrian then you have a handicap. Traffic is dangerous and public transport is prohibitive….unless you already know your way. If you just use Google maps o Here maps for navigation you will be trapped.So we need to figure out a soft mobility map which can help us demonstrate that you don't have to stay home or take your car to the gym to work out. You can get around in many ways and keep fit at the same time.We neednavigation for soft mobility with possibility to set limitations waypoints of broad interest (not just googles shops, restaurants and gas stations) indications of feasibility on a user defined level (accessibility, interesting way, playgrounds, etc. Who's in?
Stress Management collar is one of our ideas about stress. Nowadays everyone knows that stress is one of the most important problems of our lives and most difficult to manage it totally. Our idea is mostly for manage it during the traffic jams. The collar have multiple features on it and might be a solution to help some of us.The basic idea was to create a flexible tangible object like collar which would do some kind of massage to the wearer to lower the tension of the moment. Another important feature is the ability to spray every a specific time adjusted by us a smell that what researches have shown relax the person (grass, flower, forest etc).The last feature this collar has is the ability to stick a usb driver or connect with spotify  and connect with blue-tooth with the cars’ media player so you can listen to your favourite music anytime while you are driving. The collar could also be connected with your mobile so you can “monitor” your stress levels to be aware.
BackgroundThere are tons of reasons that makes baby cries. Baby might be hungry, sleepy, diaper dirty or more and more. While the baby is crying, mom has to check what the exact problem is, and before mom solves it, the baby won’t stop crying. In this period, mom might feel anxious, stressful or panic that from the crying sound, herself or others. This mental situation might influence mom’s decision making or education for the baby.In some case, mom has to leave her baby to cry.What if these all happen in a silence public such as an airplane, train, office or a good restaurant et.? To prevent this kind of situation happened, lots of parents even avoid to go to those places with their baby or even stay at home. What are the main aspects of this project?With the baby crying sound reducer parents can have more choice to go with their baby. It can also reduce the stress that comes from the stranger beside and creates a better quality of life for parents and people together in the same space. How to?Main Function + Active Noise Cancellation Technology+ Baby soothing materialsSecondary Function +Volum control+ Speaker output from baby with funny sound to make fun of himselfWhat have been done?There hasn’t been anything specific active noise cancellation product that has been designed for baby and parents. Most of the active noise cancellation technology are used in earphone and space. 
T-shirts 4 Open CommunicationMain aspect of this project is to create an environment that deaf people can open up to the world through T-shirts...More people use T-shirts, deaf people have a voice. This is also an awareness project about the isolation the deaf people. Because only friend's t-shirts can capture the sign language. (through the gloves)

The seemingly unstoppable drive for ever-increasing economic growth is doing irreparable damage to the planet, to flora and fauna, and to human wellbeing. Fokus Wachstumswende is a project that offers a civil society platform connecting various civil society organizations and scientific institutions that are looking into alternatives to an economic model that is dependent upon constant growth, and thus the depletion of the environment and the exhaustion of human resources. The platform is based on a network called “Zivile Enquete Wachstum, Wohlstand Lebensqualität” (Civil Enquete Growth, Prosperity, Life Quality) that extends from the Degrowth-Conference 2014 in Leipzig. The network meets on a quarterly basis and includes representatives of a broad variety of civil society organizations and scientific institutions concerned with social or environmental issues. The intention is to raise awareness on post-growth-ideas, to facilitate an exchange between different levels and fields, and to create potential synergies. For instance, NGOs often lack a scientific or theoretical backbone for their work, while theoreticians often miss the benefit of practical experience. The sciences in turn lack the ability to communicate their findings to the public at large. The network also works with political foundations and unions, yet the work transcends party lines. Together they generate concrete suggestions for policies that look toward the notion of a post-growth society and they work on storytelling to communicate these proposals to a broader public. On a superficial level, it may seem like the degrowth movement is all about economics and has little to do with care. Yet the vicious circle of increasing production and consumption that we call economic growth is quite clearly making a lot of people unhappy and sick. Beyond certain thresholds, more growth does not necessarily equal a better quality of life. Eliminating the external and internal pressures for senseless growth would allow us to reconsider human potential. Reducing working hours for example can lead to more time for exchange and support between people and new concepts for more societal participation. A post-growth economy is based on sustainable activity within planetary boundaries and a more healthy future!https://wachstumswende.de/project/fokus-wachstumswende/
Breast Cancer RecognizerIdea is about detecting the breast with a prototype which have a skin recognition and accelometre to map the breast. It is necessary because every women and men needs to check their breasts once a month. And the techniques of detecting the breast cancer early is so complicated. First with 2 fingers you should message your arm pit. With 3 fingers you should rub down your breast in a circle to the niple... We can optimize this with a prototype.What are the main aspects of this project?Our goal is to detect the cancer in early stage. Our perspective is “it can happen to anyone” It is an awareness and caring project. So we encourage all the people to look after theirselves with our prototype and catch the cancer before it is too late.How to?We should show supervisors the research and prototype of Yemen University’s to think about more simple ways to make this prototype happen. Because their system is so complex and difficult to built with only Arduinos.http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2014/Lisbon/BIOENV/BIOENV-20.pdfReleated Work done by Yemen University
Caregivers constitute the largest part of the workforce in health and care systems. At the same time, they are typically the ones with the least access to technological means and the necessary digital knowhow. Yet the very people who are performing the day to day work of caregiving have a wealth of real life experience and knowledge that can be used to generate innovative ideas and practical solutions for improving the tools and conditions for their work – and thus the results.  The Care FabLab is an open community platform and mobile creative workshop in which the primary aim is the collaborative implementation of innovative ideas and projects for care through the use of digital fabrication methods. It is a network of creative caregivers and interested people with the common purpose of developing innovative solutions to improve daily patient care. The Care FaLab provides the platform, tools and training with which to present new ideas and discuss them among the community, as well as the means to develop concepts for implementation and create prototypes. All of the information and content is freely available to the community and can be used by participants for their own projects. On this platform, members can present their own ideas about projects, products or processes to improve care. Other members can then comment on those ideas to assess, augment or enhance them. Special virtual working groups can be created for interested members to join in order to work on particular projects. Based on these ideas, concepts can be developed and even implemented collectively. And it all takes place under the Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 3.0) and is thus freely available for all! The mobile FabLab including the innovation workshop can be booked for hospital clinics, nursing schools, symposia and conferences. Participants will be guided and supported through processes of brainstorming and conception, all the way through to the resulting production using 3D-printers and other relevant digital tools. In this way, in just one or two unforgettably creative days, innovative solutions for caregivers by caregivers can be developed and realized! http://fablab.care/ 
Autistic children have limited behaviours about social connections and they can easily get confused from hearing more than one sound when they are outside. We want to help the children to get out into the world without fear. Usually children get very scared of loud noises and it a ects their behaviour. They nd it very intimidating. We propose to care for them by designing a device that lets them hear their parent’s and other familiar voices, phasing out other sounds like those of tra c, crowd, machines etc. What are the main aspects of this project?The main aspect of this project is to use technology that is not only advanced but also very much user friendly. The prototype will be able to have speech recognition so that it detects the sounds of certain people and lets them through but not intimidating sounds like those of tra c and machines How to?We can-use noise cancelling technology and speech recognition software to design the prototype-introducing simple gestures to use and control the headphones Links for reference:http://oureverydaylife.com/use-headphones-children-autism-12460.htmlhttp://www.got-autism.com/blog/?tag=headphones-for-kids-with-asd  What have been done?There hasn’t been anything speci c that has been designed for autistic children that serves the purpose we intend to solve. There have been independent approaches to speech recognition through software and headphones through software.
We want to provide care for people living in neighbour- hoods with lot of noise around them. Noise can a ect physical and mental health of people. Noise pollution in the cities can take a toll on the quality of life of the people. Research has shown that noise pollution can cause problems like heart diseases, stress, lack of sleep and hearing loss to some extent. The average recom- mended noise exposure limit is 55 decibels. However, tra c accounts for 70 decibels and construction machin- ery accounts for about 120 decibels. These are the major generators of sound in the city and well beyond the average exposure limit. We want to provide care to the people living with so much noise around them by using technology. What are the main aspects of this project?The main aspect of this project is to use technology to provide care for the people so that they have a healthy lifestyle How to?We can-use transducers on the walls or windows of the house. -sensors that sense the movement of people in the house, detecting whether to switch the device on-LCD screen showing the decibel levels outside Links for reference:http://www.explainthatstu .com/noisecancellingheadphones.htmlhttp://doctord.dyndns.org/Pubs/POTENT.htm What have been done?www.silentium.com/bloghttp://www.ippinka.com/blog/sono-peace-quiet-home/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wnc/whisper-the-noise-cancelerhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/muzo-personal-zone-creator-w-noise-blocking-tech-sound-sleep#/
Parkinson's, as we all know, is a serious ailment for which there has not been a cure yet. What makes the ailment even more intimidating is that the symptoms keep varying from person to person and we never know in what way is going to affect the patient. Wave, as our team is called, is trying to make someone suffering from parkinson's and their caregiver's lives easier using technology that we have today at our disposal.The first signs of someone having parkinson's are the motor symptoms. These symptoms include essential tremors in hands and other parts of the body. These symptoms further advance overtime enough that it makes it difficult for them to perform the easiest of daily tasks. The symptoms occur when the level of dopamine, the chemical responsible for body movement coordination, reduces in the brain. Medication is used to replenish the dopamine levels or fake the action of the dopamine.With our prototype, we propose to make the lives of someone with parkinson’s simpler. Our prototype will be wearables that can monitor the motor symptoms of the patient. Our prototype will monitor the common symptoms like tremor and stiffness in the human body, and if the symptoms are showing an uncommon behaviour, the prototype can beam the information to the smartphone to remind the patient or the caregiver to take the medicines to or to see the neurologist.Our goal is to help someone who has recently started showing symptoms of parkinson’s to track their motor symptoms and also prolong the initial stage as much as possible.A lot of research-based apps and services are available today that help in better understanding the symptoms of Parkinson’s. Apps like mPower and Parkinson’s Central are monitoring the patient’s health from their rdaily movements and tasks along with daily or weekly surveys. With our prototype, we not only propose to help in tracking symptoms to better understand the disease but we also want to help the patient in the best way possible. 
Idea is about helping blind people about the outside world’s obsticles. Smart stick should have a simcard for navigation (GPRS) communication with friends, family and hospitals. Smart stick should have accelometre sensor to sense the obstickles in streets and roads. It should be used with earphone. It should converts envori- ments conditions to sound via APPs or API’s of google Maps. Normal people could use it too, it can be designed as 2 peaces (modular) People without disabilities can take the top part from the stick and put it in their bags (with earphones) What are the main aspects of this project?Our goal is to help the blind people. Our perspective is to find a way to eleminate the difficulties they face everyday. How to?We can- use a eyeglasses with earphones - headsets and eye bandages- blind smart sticksTechonolgy out there- infrared sensors- Arduino + 3 ultrasound sensors+ buzzer +motor - Another chipset + RFID + ultrasound sensor Project Halo:- Rigid frame (I used a round embroidery frame)- Female headers (for the sensors)- Ultrasonic Rangefinders (Parallax Ping Rangefinders) - Wire (Wires with male and female leads are conve-nient)- Glue- Twist ties to tidy up wiring- Soldering station- Male headers (for creating a bridge to feed 5v and ground- RJ-45-Term Screw Terminal (2) - RJ-45 Cable- MarkerMotor Modules:- Vibration Motors (5) - Motot, VIB,3V/60mA, 7500RPM- Grid-Style PC Board- Male header pins- Motor "shroud" (to prevent things getting sucked into the motor)Haptic Headband:- Headband- Sewing Kit- 5 Motor Modules- Wire (Wires with male and female leads are conve-nient)- Safety Pins- Female headers- Soldering station- RJ-45-Term Screw Terminal (2) - RJ-45 Cable- Marker Wiring the Microcontroller:- Arduino Mega 2560- Wire (Wires with male and female leads are conve- nient)- 5 LEDs- Darlington IC - ULN 2803A - 2 port screw terminal- 9v battery- 5v regulator Building the Software:- USB cable- PC (for editing code and downloading to Arduino)- Arduino- Arduino development environment (www.arduino.cc) - Source Code, modified Ping.h library Smart Blind Stick - InstructablesAn Arduino uno.A Ultrasonic sensor( HCSR04 ).A Mini breadboard.A 9 volt battery.A 9 volt battery connector.DC male power jack.A Buzzer.Some Jumper wire.An Broken cellphone from scratch.A Toggle switch.Other tools and parts used in this project :3/4 inch diameter PVC pipe (used for making the stick).3/4 inch diameter PVC elbow.Insulation tape.Some small screws for mounting Arduino.

My studies in biology, agriculture and sociology took place in a time where the environmental, social and ethical problems related to the broken food system started becoming visible to more and more people across the world. Since about 10 years ago, food activism raised as our generations Woodstock, something that some of us like to call “Foodstock”. Therefore, the lines between political activism and an academic life started becoming very thin, and in times it felt -indeed- awkward to interact with two environments that hardly communicated to each other. Maybe for a good reason.In 2007, I travelled to India for the first time, to do my MSc thesis in the Central Indian Himalayan belt, in collaboration with Navdanya, an NGO founded by renowned food and seeds activist, Dr. Vandana Shiva. In 2008, I published my first book on human-plant relations of tribal hill communities on the noble mountains of the Garhwal Himalaya. At the same time, returning to my university in Stuttgart, Germany, I helped found F.R.E.S.H. - the Food Revitalisation & Ecogastronomic Society of Hohenheim.F.R.E.S.H. was one of the very first student initiatives in Europe, trying to engage young agricultural students in a new, holistic, and self-reflective thinking about the future of the food system. We organised conferences, peaceful protests against unsustainable practices in the university’s canteens, a student garden and we even designed and fundraised for a new academic module on the Ethics of Food & Nutrition Security. Through community work in the campus, a group of young students from more than 15 countries from around the world, started building these much needed bridges between analytical thinking and solving the world’s problems.Around this time, in 2008, I attended Slow Food’s Terra Madre in Turin. This was a game changer, which allowed my friends and me see the wider picture, and to connect with hundreds of other youth. We saw the rise of the urban gardening movement and the food waste movement. We spoke of the need for intergenerational renewal in the agricultural sector, and we started connecting the dots. For us, good food and good farming almost became an obsession, and a latent hope that maybe we can manage to improving the world, by improving our food and our quality of life.At the same year, still a student in Germany and doing my ethnobotanical research for my PhD in India, Thailand and China, I founded a Slow Food Convivium in Thrace, my home land in Northern Greece. Well before the financial crisis and the social havoc it evoked hit home, we started discussing about resilience, an organic transition, urban gardens, quality food production/consumption systems. Early days for such ideas in Greece, this action has raised plenty of scepticism, as no-one would expect what was coming. Our actions ranged from organising public social meals in squares in streets, campaigns, food fairs, etc. I have organised three delegations of small Greek producers to Slow Food fairs in Italy and Germany, and as the crisis was unfolding, I wanted to show that a difference Greece exists -other than the one presented by the media and blamed by politicians- and it was here. In 2012, I produced an award winning short documentary, called “Farming on Crisis?”. This was the untold story of the Greek countryside, unfolding through a man's journey across the crisis-stricken country, uncovering the stories of young farmers and the prospects of revamping the economy through good farming and sustainable rural development. Building a bridge between the small and the large; the urban and the rural; the local with the global, the film used the case of Greece in order to touch urgent global challenges like food security, the environment and the future of our food. This movie travelled around the world, screened in several film festivals and opened a new dialogue: what future can we hope for, with only 6% of Europe’s farmers under the age of 35? We even got an award in Hollywood.As my life proceeded into this environment, I started venturing into good food entrepreneurship. From one side, I was launching global petitions for a better agricultural food system, to be presented at Rio+20, on the other hand I started discussing with my parents plans about revamping our family’s traditional olive grove in Northern Greece. At 2012, we created Calypso, a single varietal extra virgin olive oil made inside the ancient grove of my small village, Makri. Our purpose was (and still is), not only to produce a product of the utmost quality, but to champion innovative agroecological practices, trying to invite more farmers of the region in our journey towards sustainable quality. Soon after, I joined forces with another Italian friend from my former Slow Food years, and then we joined by another one, and another one, and we created We Deliver Taste. This is a small consultancy company connecting agriculture with gastronomy, hospitality and marketing. We are consulting good farmers and help them access new markets, while working with restaurant owners and chefs in order to close the loops in the “broken food system” that we all new is a major part of the problem. This is of utmost importance for Greece and its post-crisis future,  since the country has one of the largest per capita agricultural populations in Europe. We are now establishing new partnerships, working with ICT developers and experimenting on open data systems, with the aim of creating tools that bring more transparency and education in food supply chains, and shorten them in terms of communication and enhanced interaction among all peers.Having experienced these transformation at the personal and social level, I still continue doing a lot of community research in Greece. To me, my country has emerged as a testing ground for a new transformative future, what I like to call the “Plan C”. That is, if the “Plan A” is a Grexit, and “Plan B” is a devastating bankruptcy, then I think there is also space to investigate the possibility for another plant. The “Plan C” has to do with the design of a roadmap for advancing towards a real transition back to the Commons, based on civil engagement for participatory mapping and collective management of the assets that influence what is currently under attack: the everyday lives of the people.Inspired by the many different communities on the rise throughout the country, and concerned about the lack of resources and the disconnection between them, #BackToCommons is my latest project. This is not an organisation (I don’t think there is a need to be one - there are so many organisations which we work with), but rather an informal network of young researchers who are trying to pull resources for creating systemic infrastructure in Greece. The aim is to give a new hope to a desperate society, but also connect this action with the world, knowing that a lot of people in the ground don’t have access to resources, due to many known barriers. Lack of funds and language are only two of them.I am not sure where the journey of #BackToCommons is going to end, but I am convinced that it is heading towards the right direction. More and more people in Greece start believing on the power of commons-based action, and what is considered an “alternative” in other, more affluent economies of Europe in the world, over here is pretty much the only way forward. Despite the discontent, this offers a significant opportunity for working out transition solutions that I am sure are going to prove very useful for the international community.I know that given the political, organisational and financial support, realising this type of transition is  one of the few chances we have in order to achieving the very possibility of realising the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives mapped out at COP21. More importantly, as extremism is on the rise across the continent, what is needed more than ever before, are new narratives that connect our societies - not separate them. And in the absence of political sense, I think that we the people can still continue building them.
We are a community of freelance developers and other digital professionals who work together online often purely over the internet. We started our project RefugeesWork to help newcomers to connect with locals who are looking for freelancers to outsource some work to them.It all started in August 2015 when lots of newcomers, mainly from Syria, arrived to Germany.It now turns out that it’s not very easy for them to find any kind of employment at all. German companies seem to not need the skills they bring to the table and even if they do have what they are looking for, they often reject people who do not speak German well.We decided to use our digital skills, first of all programming, to help them. We developed a marketplace app where on one side newcomers can register and describe their skills and on the other side local organizations can post their requests for freelancers. We believe work is the best pathway to connect refugees and locals and to date, we have over 300 registrations on the site and big community in Berlin and online. Those Syrians come from all walks of life and some have excellent background, or were running their own business.But we also realized that freelance requests are mostly for freelancers with web and mobile development background. These are the jobs freelancers can do online, they don't need to speak the local language and because all the organizations are trying to automate their processes, there is actually a big need for these professions. We checked our database and available statistics and figured out that most of newcomers are young, they just finished their high school or had to leave in the middle of their studies so they actually lack necessary skills to integrate into the highly specialized German job market. Freelancing would give refugees freedom from discrimination they would face otherwise and freelancers are usually paid way better. The tricky part is in making sure there is a regular flow of work. That is our experience.Therefore we decided to extend our Berlin based coding school for kids and use our experiences to create online e-learning platform to teach newcomers programming: from how to install browser to how to build your mobile app. All the learners can learn digital skills/programming no matter where they are, they get 24/7 support on the chat from mentors and other learners and later and they can apply for projects companies outsource through RefugeesWork. All the learners become part of digital collective Coding Amigos, that we started with international crew of developers with activist streak already 3 years ago. We meet in Berlin 2x a week and co-work together on client projects or our own apps that we in long term want to connect in a circular economy. For us - even though circular economy is usually connected to recycling - that means that supply chains form supply circles and money is not loaned by governments and other usual suspects and end up in always the same pockets who save it and don’t even know what to do with all the money.Currently we are also following the work of Sensorica in Canada and Enspiral in New Zealand. Our wish is to create a micro-holding co-ownership model. One part of the motivation is to shield these professionals from all kinds of discrimination that they might otherwise experience.It shields them, for example from the usual politicking among corporate employees who might tend to put such newcomers into a fairly low place. And another part of the motivation is exploring processes and legal ways for cooperation and decision making between many micro-holdings.We try to list all our initiatives inside of Github organization SquatUp.We try to keep all our work open and transparent for which we for now use Github.com, Gitter.im and Waffle.io which allow us versioned storing our documents, including code, working on issues on a kanban board and use open communication on a public chat.All our projects are made with zero budget so with pure love and dedication for our mission: open source & transparency, inclusiveness, digital literacy and open organization. It is not easy, but we don't want to waste our time chasing funding and investors or clients, but instead co-create the world we want to live in. And we believe right people and opportunities will come from that and from the people that share the mindset and want to join us.It’s hard to make a living with all of this, so we just try to live as cheap as possible and we work for a better future where society is organized differently utilizing radical transparency and open source. Until then we live from savings that we sometimes manage to build when working on paid projects. By empowering refugees with skills we hope they will later become our partners and continue to help us build an alternative work. On top of that, we might manage to get in projects on a more regular basis and outsource paid work to each other.So if you are a programmer, ”apptivist”, please consider reaching out and connect your apps to our ecosystem via API or help us build an open ecosystem of related apps.If you know anyone who did not yet start to learn programming, please tell them to join us in http://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners so they can get started for free immediately. We offer 24/7 support for free to get learners from zero to be able to create their first mobile app within a couple of weeks up to a few months given learners are disciplined and learn full time.And last but not least, if you can bring in paid IT projects to support our voluntary efforts, the community of learners and our effort to prototype alternative ways of organizing and working together, we would appreciate it a lot. Everyone who successfully brings in a project and helps us communicating with the customer during the project will be transparently included in the sharing of the revenue.The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.Links:RefugeesWork - www.refugeeswork.comOnline JavaScript school - www.wizardamigos.comCoding Amigos meetup - www.meetup.com/codingamigosCoding Amigos collective - www.codingamigos.comSquatUp - https://github.com/SquatUp/projects/blob/master/README.mdNina Breznik - @ninabreznikAlexander Praetorius - @serapath
 #OPENandChange Workshop Berlin “Living, working and ageing healthily within society” The OPENandChange workshop in Berlin began with a round for participants to introduce themselves. This led straight into individual and collective reflection and the mapping of questions that mattered to participants. Here, three key issues emerged, which participants gathered in three working groups to address.One group tackled the question of "How can we provide care and preventative care adequately and accessibly?" in a process of collective brainstorming and idea development. As a central starting point was the agreement that care and prevention services should be provided by real people for real people, and thus to counteract the further dehumanization in care - both toward those being cared for, but also the caregivers themselves, as has been spreading as a result of the savings and efficiency measures, particularly in the public sector care, such as hospitals and nursing homes,. Based on this arose an idea for central, physical places and spaces in which cross-generational knowledge sharing communities with a decentralized "bottom-up" structure can develop. This should activate the local community at large and encourage more people to visit and thus bringing them together. Simultaneously, through the use of modern telecommunications and the Internet, communities that are located in remote areas will be included – the challenge of inadequate or even non-existent Internet connections in these areas could be countered by open-source technology solutions, such as balloons that are equipped with Internet. The necessary financial resources could be generated by a crowdfunding campaign, also to generate more public attention, especially online, for teaching/learning/exchange spaces for this innovation and strengthen the cohesion of the existing community. A key component of the engagement in these areas could be workshops of all types and themes to be organized, offered and held by participants themselves. These spaces could make a contribution to the initial formulation of questions, because a social community that is open and accessible for all faces the challenge of accessibility to prevention and care, supported by the Internet. Care and prevention again become a matter for the community, and are thus realized in a humane and proportionate way.This common "bottom-up" structure was made tangible in a first prototyping, which opened the question "How can we engage individuals to support these structures, even if they ostensibly do not (yet) benefit from them?"The prototype incorporated the approach of small and relatively autonomous systems where the supply and demand of communities for health and social themes can not only be met, but also that such knowledge can be bundled onsite and via the internet everyone has access to the spaces. Decisions about the design of health promoting coexistence are shaped by the particpating actors themselves. Finally, assumptions were formulated, which should be examined, scrutinized and discussed in the network in order to make this approach more effective and more efficient. Because even subtle or unconscious perceptions and attitudes can potentially be found in each concept, it needs to be balanced by many, diverse and also conflicting perspectives on the concept to make it more resistant. It was also reflected that a certain basic attitude is required of all potential participants to form these care and prevention networks. Another important point is posed by the question of: "How can momentum be created for these spaces and networks?"Another group addressed the question of: "How can we, based on commonalities, learn more from each other?" In a idea development and brainstorming process on this issue, the importance of local and personal interaction was recognized. This includes the networking of stakeholders and users, potentially through an interactive map on the Internet such as used by www.berlinimwandel.de. It also requires the organizing of engaging workshops where actors can share their enthusiasm for relevant topics with others by presenting them as relevant themes, and optionally also to demonstrate activities to make them tangible. In addition, activities such as role reversals to expand the individuals' horizons of experience are possible, as is done, for example, in working with "age suits" – young people slip into full-body suits equipped with weights to enable the experience of having an aged body.In a first prototype lifting the existing resources were, theoretically and practically, visualized through a mapping of individual and collaborative networking, both online and offline and person. This process led to the realization that everything is actually there to the realization of this idea already what is needed, when the dedicated actors gathered as OPENandChange workshop, work together and share their resources and combine theory with practice. These assumptions to check it seems important in the first step to begin with themselves, so to make the possibility of designing a different world tangible. This iterative process leads to fresh insights. But the community-based approach not only leads to new insights, but can lead to a higher incidence of fun and joy, and ultimately health and well-being by strengthening group working experiences.The third working group focused on the question: "How can we increase the societal appreciation for a public welfare oriented social system?" Also during this idea development and brainstorming process, the need for people to meet in person in "their" area, city, country was emphasized. For example, working in interactive groups can lead to an intensification of togetherness and can make prevention and care topic. The supposedly negative connotations otherwise associated with these concepts such as disease, death and a feeling of helplessness are thus transformed. A positive attitude towards the subject is promoted, fears can be reduced, and at the same time the respect and appreciation for the work of nurses and caregivers is increased. In particular, a playful approach to the subject can support this project and convey the idea that all can benefit. Another important aspect for answering the initial question is to explore the current actual situation in care. The question as to why the appreciation in prevention and care sector is so low can lead to valuable information to help find solutions. In prototyping, the motto of "living appreciation" was made tangible and concrete: Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs. To test this assumption requires a thorough basic research of existing resources, as well as bureaucratic hurdles, and to examine stakeholders, especially those who are not participating.Based on the work of the three groups, the following definition of the problems was generated:•    Dehumanization of health and social systems •    The focus on treating symptoms rather than promoting healthy lifestyles •    Privatization and capitalization of public goods, which should be accessible to all The concrete solution that the participants collectively devised, states that:•    All we need is there if we work together and share our resources•    A paradigm shift is needed: "From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis" – Solidary Health Promotion System with Global Knowledge Network and Local Action Spaces •    Working "with people for people" and connect visionaries, experts, institutions and places through concrete actions This solution leads to the following intended:•    Employing existing treasures: Mapping for individual and community networking, online and in person, in theory and practice •    Practising appreciation: Create care and prevention spaces in the middle of society to fulfill the basic needs of all and create new incentive/recognition structures in the long term •    Local systemic change: Developing new skills, resources and infrastructure that can be used by all of us: children, young people, adults, seniors (people in all phases of life). Strong arguments for the proposal are:•    Bottom-up structure with small relatively autonomous systems, who self-regulate the supply and demand of health and social services for individuals and communities •    Only through shared ownership effectiveness and sustainability can this be secured Our approaches, technologies and tactics are:•    Active participation of ALL leads to a prototype that works for the majority and meets their needs (human-centered development of global platform and local spaces) •    Collective, iterative structure combining theory and practice •    Global Knowledge Network – CAREPEDIA: bundled knowledge (Internet / platform) all have access to the "central office" •    Local Action Spaces: Locally designed and managed spaces for health-promoting coexistence "From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis"We believe our solution will work because: We have existing needs (more than 80% of people want a functional and appreciative system for care and prevention ) and real effects from a dehumanized health and care system. We know many people and institutions that are interested in cooperating and who would gladly contribute their respective expertise. Another world is within reach. There are many projects and movements to prove it. We shall make this even more visible. Everything we need is already there. We need the courage to try it, to experience and live it. We can make an active contribution to this. Financial resources are not a challenge or necessity to achieve this.As expected results – in the context of existing cases – we use the following examples: Successful EcoVillages such as Mondragon (a community in the Basque Country without police). Giving spaces, exchange meets and free shops. Micro-agriculture in the city. Urban gardening. Community-supported agriculture creates new relationships between city and land. There are urban farming initiatives in Detroit, critical consumption movements in Italy (GAS), alternative currency systems such as WIR in Switzerland, and solidarity networks for food supply and health clinics in Greece, as well as Networks such as SOLIDAGO and Artabana in Germany. And many more.Furthermore, our proposal is confirmed by literature and scientific consensus such as in the field of neuronal research: Fear paralyzes reason and creativity and leads to depression due to stress and alienation . Yet willingness for lifelong learning, creates new neural connections. Further scientific findings such as the Hierarchy of Needs Maslow, the concept of The Ever-Present Origin (Stuttgart 1949-1953) by Jean Gebser, the classic theories of J.M. Baldwin, G.H. Mead, J. Piaget (The Psychology of the Child) and L. Kohlberg as well as related work by C. Gilligan, F. Oser and M. Parsons. Also the literature and research by Ken Wilber, Aurobindo Ghose, Ervin László, Don Beck, and Michael Murphy;  work on Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, und the research by Kropotkin, who proved that cooperation is more important than competition in the animal kingdom and is effective for the survival of the group. Also the ample literature on the topics of sustainable lifestyles, Solidarity economy, Holacracy and Sociocracy support our suggested solution.However, it is necessary to keep sight of the risks. Here there are also a number of examples that could occur either externally or internally: The risk that corporations hijack the ideas and commercialize them, such as happened with Carsharing and CoLiving. External factors such as war, social conflicts, the collapse of the financial system, climate change and its consequences, privatization of public goods such as drinking water, and environmental disasters could endanger our plans.But also our inner monsters, such as greed and the hunger for power  could torpedo the project. There is always a danger that the idea is not accepted, that the needs of the stakeholders are not met or met only partially; that there are "too many cooks" or that the concept can not be implemented due to conflicting priorities, or dependencies between partners and networks arise.Yet we see possibilities to work against these risks. Reality has proven that it already works, and many people are working toward this aim worldwide:We are many! We cooperate and we are a network. We have sufficient human capacity. Our approach is flexible and can be used in existing structures and institutions. Dependence on existing systems and infrastructures can be solved via an "open-source" approach that leads to a multiplying effect, where copying is allowed and actively encouraged.This leads to the reduction of fears, relaxation, deceleration, satisfaction and happiness. There will be systemic relief or elimination of the superfluous, as well as personal and societal development potential through inclusion and the integration of "fringe groups" such as unemployed, refugees or marginalized citizens.For evaluation it is intended to study these criteria and assumptions in order to confirm them: Self-organization in groups works. Positions, attitudes and values are part of a common vision. Skills are included and allocated according to an open source principle. The new system or the new platform reaches more people and connects more participants than previous systems or platforms. There are spaces where encounters already take place. Spaces can be created where encounters are possible. Spaces that meet various needs lead to added value for all.Interestingly, it can be stated that all three working groups arrived at very similar approaches and ideas, problems and solutions during this intense, exciting and inspiring eight hour workshop: A change of perspective and a paradigm shift is required - instead of focusing on fighting disease, working towards the promotion of health!Caroline Paulick-Thiel & Jahn Harrison, nextlearning e.V.Translation: Alexander Paulick-Thiel
Street Nurses (Infirmiers de Rue): How do we help people living in the street for more than 10years?The non-profit organization Street Nurses was formed in April 2005, following a year and a half of field studies. Two Nurses realized that, despite there being many medical and social organizations in Brussels (Belgium), there were still a great number of homeless people in the Belgian capital. They noticed that personal care and health were major issues for homeless people and were convinced that they could solve these problems.The organization has three primary goals: field work, trainings and tools.Field work: Street Nurses takes to the streets to meet patients directly in their environment, without asking for payment. We take care of them, earning their trust, and we motivate them to take charge of their personal care and health by accompanying them to specific care facilities, by actively listening to their needs and giving them advice.Our work is also based on prevention and the dissemination of health information. We are medical and social intermediaries between, on the one hand, persons who live in an extremely precarious situation and on the other, healthcare professionals and social workers.The follow-up of patients ends with the integration of the patient in accommodation where he or she is regularly supported by professionals and volunteers of Street Nurses, and a network of social associations.We aim to assist persons who live in extremely precarious situations by offering them a home and by permanently reintegrating them into society. This medium- to long-term goal is achieved by improving the living conditions and the hygiene of these individuals, as well as their self-esteem.Trainings: Street Nurses organizes different types of awareness-raising sessions and training courses in French or Dutch on ‘hygiene and precariousness’ and ‘basic first aid’.  These trainings are address to any target group that is likely to come into direct contact with homeless people or that works with people who live at home and have major hygiene issues. Our nurses organize sessions on site – in schools, in the offices of security guards and social workers, clinics etc.Tools: Street Nurses develops prevention tools and information packages to raise awareness among homeless persons about the importance of personal care and health, to give them better access to care and to facilitate their medium - to long-term rehabilitation. Certain tools, however, are aimed at raising awareness among the general public about the situation of homeless people. Examples: list of showers in Brussels, map of fountains and free public conveniences, symptoms and interventions in case of hypothermia, Frostbite prevention poster, Heat stroke prevention posterSince 2005 the non-profit organization Street nurses has grown and its projects are continuously developed. Today, Street Nurses has the equivalent of 13,84 full-time staff members and approximately 60 volunteers.We saw the call by the Mac Arthur Foundation too, but we tough we were way to small to try and get it so we were very happy to receive the information trough DoucheFLux that this kind of initiative exists. We are mostly organized to search every year for new funds. We try to find the good balance between private, public and foundation funds but because of our high costs of wages it is difficult to fund foundations that are willing to support us. Most of them give only money for material or structural projects, not for day to day tasks, and that is what Street Nurses is all about.Since a couple of years we opened our work to an even more inclusive service. We have a collaboration going on with Social housing agencies in Brussels to try to give homeless people a decent home at the end. We participate to the program Housing First Brussels.We have a good network within the association field in Brussels, but when we go to specific funds we are not transcribed in their goals. For example, they help by giving furniture for kids, or funds for kid projects. But our main audience, people living on the street between 8 and 20 years is often forgotten.Something rather unique in the social field is that we have one of our colleagues that is paid by two different organizations, ours and another non-profit organization. This makes it possible to create a solid bridge between both organizations and have a great information flow. We think there is bright future is this way of work.Finally we organize a colloquium the 20th of October in Brussels that has as goal to eradicate homelessness in Brussels for ever. With the mindset: if even we can find homes for the most difficult audience, you can too! We want to share our experience in the field. It takes time and dedication for each of our people to do the whole process, from getting the confidence, to willing to have a stable home. But we want to show that the hard work also has direct results, and if we rally our forces we can go for a total abolishment of homelessness in Brussels!
We are the families of the "Oltrarno", the other or wrong side of the Arno river in Florence, Italy.Facing a tough challenge - surviving in the Disneyland of the Renaissance, as a community.Right behind the Carmine church, where the Renaissance was born, families of the most varied background - both traditional and immigrant - run a garden which was donated to the population of the district by the American Red Cross in 1920 and has since been largely seized by a real estate speculator.A cross-section of ordinary people of every kind, who are beginning to work together to develop new ways of survival, friendship and beauty in an era where the "state" is no longer the key actor.As we discover our own needs, our strength, the power of working together, we find that we have a whole world of prospects before us, something much larger than the garden we started out with.We are here to listen and to learn, and of course we would be glad to show you around our side of Florence, should you ever drop by!   
-----------------------Summary ENG + FRL'atelier a généré beaucoup de contenu que vous pouvez retrouver ici-bas. Mais pour ceux qui se focalisent avant tout sur les résultats, nous avons regroupé les points les plus importants ici :1. Tout le monde souhaite plus de collaboration, mais a des difficultés à rendre cela concret.Après la première série de discussions, nous avons noté que les organisations de toute sorte sont prêtes à devenir plus collaboratives, mais qu'elles manquent d'outils pour y arriver étape par étape. Elles sont toutes conscientes de la force du travail collectif, mais n'ont jamais eu de succès sur le long terme. Dans cet atelier, nous avons essayé de trouver ce qui était important à réussir pour les collaborations, et ainsi nous en venons au deuxième point :2. Comment créons-nous de la Confiance entre organisations inconnues, mais avec le même genre de pensée ?Nous avons eu un test grandeur nature : une quinzaine d'organisations, partageant des valeurs communes et disposées à collaborer et apprendre les unes des autres, mais qui venaient à peine de se rencontrer. Après d'autres débats, nous avons réalisé que la confiance était le principal problème. Nous avons donc essayé d’encadrer la création de confiance en nous avons constaté que c’était mieux d’avoir des petits projets entre les différents groupes   afin de créer des liens entre les personnes. Ces projets peuvent être  des petits projets réalisables en quelques minutes ou une heure. A partir de là chaque pas suivant deviens une tache  plus complexe que la précédente pour créer ainsi un lien plus fort.3.   Donner de perspectives alternatives  aux soins nous fait réfléchir sur notre propre structure de soins. Finalement nous avions un de participants  qui nous a aidés à penser out of the box d’une manière perturbatrice. C’était un refugiée Syrien  qui a dû  reporter ses études de médicine pour fuir du pays et qui nous a donner  beaucoup des choses à réfléchir. Il nous voyait comme  des « boxpeople » , vivant dans une bulle et plaçant  des autres gens dans des bulles. Les personnes âgées, les sans-abri, les personnes avec des maladies psychologiques, etc. ; ils sont tous placés en dehors de la société. Il explique qu’en Syrie ils n’avaient peut-être pas un système de soins de santé efficace, mais  il est beaucoup plus humain. Ceci nous a fait penser  sur la façon comment nous voyons les soins en Europe. C’est aussi lui qui nous a signalé sur le problème de confiance qui est créé ici dans l’ouest.-------The Workshop gave us a lot of content that you can find here. But for those who are result oriented we compiled the most important knowledge bubbels here. 1.    Everybody is in search of collaboration solutions, but have difficulties realizing them.After the first round of discussions we noticed that all kind of organizations are ready to become more collaborative, but they are missing the step-by-step tools to achieve this. They all are conscious about the power of collaboration, but have never had successful long lasting experiences. The goal of this workshop was to find the key elements to make a collaborative initiative succeed, this leads us to the second point.2.    How do we create trust between unbeknown organizations that share the same way of thinking?We had a great test case: around 15 organizations that came together for the first time, all sharing the same ideas and willing to collaborate to learn from each other. After a lot of discussions we discovered trust was the main issue.  So we tried to frame how trust is built and concluded that we needed to start with small projects with each other, these projects don’t need to be longer  than a couple of minutes/hours, this way people start to bond. After that each following project can become more complex to create a stronger bodn between the participants.  We listed a couple of thing each would do, to immidiate have a Proof Of Concept.3. Giving other perspectives of care makes us think about our own caretaking structureFinally we had one person that helped think out of the box in a really disruptive way. He was a Syrian refugee that had to postpone his medical studies/Ph.D.  To flee the country and gave us a lot of material to think about. He saw us as 'boxpeople', living in a bubble and putting others in bubbles. Elderly, homeless people, psychological ill are all given a space outside society. They maybe didn't have the most efficient healthcare system, but he explained it was much more humane. It made us think a lot about how we see care in the west. He was also the person that pointed out the problem of trust we create in the west.----------------------- Last Saturday we hosted a quit successful workshop in Brussels around the Open & Care thematic with local participants and workers of the designated field. We had a set up loosely based on the Berlin workshop and will go deeper into the methodology, the preparation, the participants and outcome in the following text. This article is a more organized version of the thinkpad we put online at the workshop and where people could transcribe what was being said.PreparationReaching out Dutch, French & English invitationsIn the beginning of the preparation of the workshop I reached out to my network of socially involved people who could have interesting stories to add to the platform. It was sometime difficult to explain them the whole concept through mail, so I decided to meet the people who wanted more information. This gave me the following graphical content. Without surprise the most active and responsive people came from the makers and changemakers scene. They immediately connected to the higher goal and activated their network. The least responsive network where the politicians, coming back from their annual non-active period it was difficult to activate them. Every attempt ended up in a dead end.How to create the communityBut after a couple of weeks building up a community, a moment of panic occurred. The people where reacting positively towards the workshop, but hesitated to get more involved. The confirmed list of people was stagnating, so I opened a debate on the Edgeryders platform to see how we can resolve that issue. After getting some clarifications from the team that organized the Greek workshop and some tips from people that organized a lot of workshops i changed my method and opened up with a more general approach through mailing lists and facebook groups. The combination of both locally anchored contacts and general presentations of the workshop filled the last gaps. We had 28 confirmed people and around 40 interested contacts in a mailing list.One on One discussions / Text submissionsBefore the workshop occurred this where the people wanting to start already a conversation on their work around social and medical care. Some articles will be added in the future because they are still under construction.Xavier – Makestorming (French version, English version)Yannick – Huis VDH (Text 1, Text 2)Sigried – Repurposing spaceGinette – Sidenote on the role of the gouvernementLaurent – DoucheFluxMaite – Infirmière de RueWinnie – ReaGent (Text 1, Text 2)Intergenerational Care: A Game that never wasYbe – TraumatourRozina – Belgium Design Council Preparing the spaceFor the people at Huis VDH it was also a big challenge to prepare the space that was under construction for already two months. The house is being renovated and invented by a team of volunteers to become a hub for social, cultural and technological innovators.  Each of the core members took a task to facilitate the workshop. Maria found a socially involved catering service, Sigried arranged the space to be workshop ready, Toha was responsible for the photographical documentation and Cecile prepared everything so the outcome would be documented in a nice visual style by using Toha’s skills and the templates. Yannick participated and worked as a transcriber at the workshopMethodologyBerlin WorkshopWe based ourselves on the Berlin workshop that was filled with interesting methods to actively think about care issues in Belgium. We made our workshop a little less dense because we didn’t think we could go through all the materials they prepared.Brussels VersionIn the link above you can find our preparation of the Brussels version, like said before it is a watered down version of the Berlin workshop while also using some methods Stefanos and Nadia came with. Both are experienced facilitators.Roles Workshop leaderWe decided that Nadia will take the lead on this workshop cause she is the most in touch with the OpenAndChange material and has a lot of experience doing so. She also presented the whole OpenAndChange project in the beginning of the day. Her firm method helped to not defer to long to side discussions and held us on the right pad.FacilitatorsStefanos proposed himself as a facilitator and helped us streamline our toughs throughout the day trying to condense all the ideas that where emerging in little post its on a white board. I helped out by translating the most difficult parts in French or English so anybody could speak there native language if needed. This facilitated the conversation.DocumentationCecile, Noemi and Toha played all an important role in the documentation. Noemi setting up the Thinkpad so we could transcribe live as a team what was being said the whole day. Cecile making a visual representation of the most interesting quotes combined with a picture of each made by Toha.ParticipantsFrom the 28 confirmed, 17 people came by that day to discuss care related topics. Here is a short introduction of each of the participants. You can find some of their quotes, issues and solutions on this document made by Cecile and Toha. Contact info can be found here.Xander: Child Psychologist: Works with young children, works with behavioral problems and autism.Benoit: Is an all around inventor and changemakers, first member of the Huis VDH family and makes ‘finding solutions to complex problems’ his general duty.Selvi & Lotfi are a couple of active Belgian that had an home for the elderly for more than 20 years. Now they are dreaming of building a micro-city where all generations could interact with each other and where care would be more then only what the government gives.Alkasem is a Syrian refugee; he was 4 years in the doctor studies but couldn’t continue there. When arriving in Brussels he couldn’t start over here neither.Claire is also part of the Réseau Solidaire and wants to build a platform for people who give and receive informal care. Her goal is to make it a place where people can feel save and where receivers of care can themselves give care to others.Loic: Concerned Architect that worked on a paper about alternative housing that can be found hereNoemi: Co-Initiator of Edgeryders.Winnie: Coming from Ghent, involved in DIY Biology (hacking and thinking outside of institutions and companies to make biology more accessible). At ReaGent people will get biological tools to build their solutions. We have equipment and a physical space and make sure that science is communicated in an accessible way. We put an emphasis on children and privileged groups, otherwise they don’t get access at all.Adeline: She is a newcomer in Huis VDH and in general interested in new solutions around society. She came by to be an observer but stayed to participated to the discussion.Jean: Is a member of the association ‘réseaux solidaires’: a group to help people with mental health issues and who are isolated from society. There is no website, everything is person related. He is a member because he is sick himself.Rozina: co-founder of Belgium Design Council and has a talent to bring people together. Was involved in the successfully funding of bar Eliza, a community project in Koekelberg and is now helping to structurize a youth football club Rittersclub.Gilles:  Former medical representative, meeting with doctors made him realize that he was more interested in preventing health. Passionate about healthy food, he want to inspire people to cook more and created a platform called Zingmenu therefor.Sophie works for the non-profit organization En Route ASBL that help people rehabilitate after difficult psychological periods in their life.Marie-Ange works already 25 years in the field of ecology transition and moved now towards housing and mental care.Laurent founded DoucheFlux 4 years ago and is now preparing to move his project towards a 1600 m2 space. He wants to empower poor people through giving them access to basic needs like showers and involving them in organizing events.Yannick: Co-founder of Huis Vdh and worked some years ago on a video game around intergenerational care.OutcomeIntroduction to OpenAndChange by Nadia (Link to presentation)Edgeryders is an open source platform that combines online and offline moments to find through other ways than the mainstream solutions for sociatal problems. Mission is to support members to create self-sustaining projects.Edgeryders creates tools to manage all the content created by the 3500 members. Open ethnographic tools for example uses the data to see what discussions are well connected. The big question that is asked as a red line throughout the day: Can healthcare systems work like Wikipedia, StackOverflow or other massively coordinated systems with very limited control and overhead?Two mechanisms at stake: 1) self selection: individuals get involved in something because they want to, and contribute because they want to 2) social networks: people and groups which move fluidly across organisations and shaping the norms as they wish Case studies of how people access community care:- Clinics in Greece - Alternative to 911 in the USWhat is op3ncare in short:- A place where we can share stories about care- Where you can find people to support projects- Where you can create solutions without being in the same placeLearning From ExperienceAfter the general introduction, the participants are asked to be devided into groups of maximum four people where they will discuss using a template about their projects. Each of them gets 10 minutes to introduce him or herself while somebody else takes notes and a third person ask questions and listens carefully.You can find the note of each of those roundtables here, some of them are in French and other in English. It is written by the participants and wasn’t cleaned up.DiscussionsPlenaryBefore the lunch we came together for an hour and shared what was remarkable about each other stories. Here you can find some of the insightsWinnie: he noticed that every project has some community in it, but communities experience different ways of being in the world, different incentives for being in a community.Laurent: 3 different projects, which have something in common, with people being excluded by the system because they are poor or sick. Empowerment for these populations is at the core of each project. Behind each there is a diagnosis of how the excluded population can have lost access to institutional support. If something is possible, it is on the edge, where people can regain access to their lives. Lotfi: Nous étions trois entités, je suis avec Selvi, nous avons eu une maison de repos, Xander travaille avec des enfants autiste, Alkasem, il espère qu'il pourrait faire son métier de médecin. On a parlé d'intergénérationnel, comment créer des mini société ou il y a des échange. Au delà d'un certain âge: il y a pas de support. Alkasem a fait la parallèle de comment le système de soin ce passe en moyen orient, une culture musulman de l'entraide. On impose de donner de l'argent au pauvre. Tout le monde vie ici dans sa bulle, il n’y a pas de transversalité. Xander:  the community aspect is really important, the human is seen as a kind of predator, humans are also caring beings. Alkasem: i have question to all of you: where are the families of the homeless people? I never saw anyone homeless in Syria, or living on a mattress. How did it happen? Some of the participants responded later on: the core family concept has been broken down - after uni and growing up you have to carry yourself; so there is no glue which keeps family togetherin North Africa systems are weak -so there has always been a cultural support; whereas in the West the system is supposed to take care of everythingHere (in the West) you are free, but alone!"Free, but alone." vs. "Belonging, but coerced" Comparing systems-based  vs. family-based cultures of care (twitter link)Jean: There is a desire of using new ways of technology to organize his place within the society je cherche a me socialiser, trouver une occupation profitable, mais je voudrais rester dans la marginalité. Find a meaning in his life, but stay at the edge of society. Claire: I want to create something can provide something that can give help to each other. It is very complicated to arrive there. With Laurent, Sophie, we have a point of connection, but we need to know each other better. I worked for several years around the project of self-care. I want to do something very new. We are creating to work on a project on different levels in December with Laurent, but it is really difficult to find what is most needed: partnership and collaboration. Adeline: Everybody here came with a need, to find ways to come up with a solution, tous le monde est venue avec un besoin, elle espère aider à trouver une solution. Gilles: Strongly believes in open source and data sharing solutions - everyone is looking for someone who can help them with a solution eg. to develop a website to help the project moving. Loic: The core needs he noticed in others is to learn information about what others are doing, get information about collaborations; and second, the need for visibility. Personally he has come here for housing project, but Winnie's story is useful to hear also professionally.Yannick: was in conversation with Kacim,Lotfi - the intergenerational interactions need to be looked into, because it is in only specific circumstances that we spend time together eg living in a house with my grandmother and the positive outcomes which came from that.             SIDENOTE: Multiple times in the discussion a same metaphor that was introduced by Alkasem was used by the participants. He noted that our western society made us all ‘boxpeople’. He finds it so strange that we are all living next to each other, but that we aren’t interacting better. We put old people in a home and (mentally) sick people in a closed environment. I found that metaphor really strong and something to use when we are trying to connect multiple organizations. Question timeAfter giving everybody the chance to share their view on the received input we gave everybody 5 minutes the time transcribe it in a question they wanted to solve in the second part of the day. These are the questions that came up:- How can communities become more visible and members interact more easily?- How do you make the actions of the community visible to the individuals?- How do you make individuals' actions more visible to the community?- How can we help individuals be independent from official caring services?- How do we invite more people to be part of the process and disseminate the documentation?- How can we find the right balance between keeping the effectiveness of the box with still being able to go out of the box/- What is the metaphor of what we are trying to do? (Stefanos) helps understand complicated things without - How do you build connectivity into each initiative or do you want connectivity only between initiative? If we all want to coordinate, what amount of time/ effort/ resources can we each put into learning to coordinate?- How could we open the debate about the strength of intergenerational care. Presentation ProjectsSome of the participants prepared a presentation of their projects. Three of them where DoucheFlux, Belgium Designers Council and Habitats 123: A testcase of alternative housing. A summary can be found here:Laurent d'Ursel / DoucheFLUX:4 years old project, we are opening a huge house to help people out of the marge, we will have 20 showers, 150 lockers, medical service, laundries, a pharmecy, and other needed services for this part of people, which is missing Second pillar is activities: DoucheFlux is 50m2 at the moment, so we work at other spaces, we make activities that promote self esteem for these people, they are totally embedded in the system, they can't escape what is happening about them, they find it difficult to get further, so their mechanism is that they just stop trying, because they don't feel empowered anymoreDoucheflux helps them to get more self-esteem, but it is difficult because sometimes it feel that we are infantilizing them, and if you do that mistake they don't come anymoreThe challenge: another way to make social work, so not only people that studied for the social sector. To take the social dream out of the social field and bring it to other fields. Because they are fed up of all the social help, they just want a happy life: it is not only important to have an home, but also to create great moments. To create equal relationships. break racism against the poor. Rozina / Business Imporvements Design BelgiumLiving in Bxl for 15 years, an interior designer coming from a corporate background working in the hospitality business. She started her own design company and got more involved in strategic design thinking - now involved with the Belgium Design Thinking. Projects to make the sports clubs more inclusive because they were closed for refugees; also hardly accessible by children with special needs. So with other people they pushed for inclusivity and speaking to the Belgium Football Union, but also preparing a strategy for the next few years.Business Improvements Design Belgium (BIDs): they are about creating a new geographical zone and linking community businesses to it, ideal for private - public partnerships.She is lobbying for BIDs and wants to see where stakeholders can meet in the middle; seems idealistic especially since she's not from here.Has seen encouraging results after talking to her mayor, and right now she's trying to create a youth platform for citizenship and sports - an IDEO design type of commune. What changed after the football? People understood there is a strategy and structure, so they get a sense of belonging. If everybody contributes something, we become as a community.We educate the value of communication, transparency...Rozina would need help to connect with people working hands on with special needs populations. Loic / Right to Housing in BrusselsPreviously office building occupied by the French community which had been vacant for 15 years. Groups of squatters moved in and made a deal with the owner to run different workshops - bike fixing, woodwork, IT etc.Some interesting facts from his paper:-social housing in Bxl is much lower, 7 % compared to the 27% in the Netherlands-7 % of houses totally empty-1 000 000 sq metres of unused office space: 40% of empty offices have been empty for 7 yearsFrom squatting to a participatory process -  a public owned space (Community Francais) but community managed: from refugees to Irish artists to Flemish doctor students. Half the people (of 60) don't have any revenues, and everyone contributes a little - from 60 eur a month to approx. 150.  In Belgium it is possible to have a temporary legal occupation for an office, so you can live in an office space!It's an office building, which means people can change the layout easily.Difference between buildings for profit and the testcase of 123:Profit building is praised for being open while just having 7% of their space being used for community. 123 has almost 50% of community used space, but because of their 'illegal' status it isn't praised.Loic showed a detailed distribution of the types of spaces - at each floor you'd have facilities, workshops, library + distribution of private and communal space. Important detail: Stairs instead of working elevators as a social control mechanism.Loic is trying to give more visibility to housing solutions - it's not easy, take good contact with the owner! First you squad, then you talk.Collaboration MosaicNow it is time to get into the concrete part of the workshop. Therefor everybody is put again into groups of maximum four people and asked to choose one of the skill cards on the table. From there they will explain why they chose that card and what skills they want to bring. Here are the skills we find in our most helpful peopleWinnie:- DIY and generally fixing things yourself- Mental support- Getting weird things you wouldn't normally find yourself- A delivery van- Someone to do a project withJean:- Can discuss Existential problem- Commercial things and buying decisionsClaire:- Making a conference atelier du capitalisme- Support people who are more fragile- Set up an associationMarie Ange:- Linking Activities- Mental/ moral support- Social contactsRozina:- Business- Experience and wisdom- Out-of-the-box thinking- Empathy- Government administration- Cultural awarenessAdeline- Active listening and sensibility- Wisdom and pragmatism- Do it yourself, engineering as a way of seeing the world- Cars Lotfi- Fundraising and financial subsidies - Medical technical knowledge- Business modeling- AdministrationGilles- Administration- Legal advice- Social business modeling- The WHY- Sharing economy- Scientific dieticiansXander- Friendship- Philosophy- Playing music- Word stuffStefanos- Order/ being orderly - Moral support and push to go forward and not backwards- Fun- The occasional hugSIDENOTE 2: Alkasem was again the most disruptive thinker in the group and gave us a lot to think. For him, everything moves around friendship. He has the feeling that a lot of people in western society start of with mistrust. If you start with mistrust it is difficult to create trust. And without trust no skill can be shared. This intervention of him started a discussion about the meaning of trust and how we can build that.‘Trust is an enabler to use the resources. How can that be created inside an eclectic group like this?’,asked Yannick.  For Claire it is a text and rules of engagement and a clear path of conflict resolution, and a way to learn to treat each other better. Winnie reacted that your own people's trust is a constant, but gaining the network's trust is more difficult.Nadia tried to made a synthesis of the discussion1) Working trust is very different from social trust; and there needs to be a boundary. 2) What also worked for her is deciding to work on even a small project.3) A story that binds us together - understanding how our different activities are 4) Documentation: what does it mean? for us it has been in writing.Finding each other strengths and weaknesses by organizing small events with each other, and beginning with things that don't have something big at stake. Because then we can learn about each other. The importance of documentation in building trust: Leaving a story behind that people can follow.Trust ExerciseWhen the discussion was coming to an end we all felt we had got a lot of information and the workshop was going to close. So Nadia came up with a good idea to end the workshop with something concrete. We all felt that one of the biggest issues in care is that we live to much on our own island and that if we want to make care better we need to share and collaborate. But to collaborate we need to create trust. So this exercise was given to every participant and will hopefully end up in solidifying the care network in Belgium. The following question was asked:What can i bring to another organization, that also better myself as a person and is easily realizable?- Loic wanting to work with the firm of Winnie- Yannick giving his game about intergeneralisation idea to Lotfi and Selvi- Marie-Ange wants to give information to Lotfi and Selvi also…Nadia Suggestion: meet in one month: Back in Huis VDH. We will invite new people to continue the conversation and structure the informal and formal networks of care. I would like to thank all the participants for this awesome day we spend reshaping care on a local level. I hope this is the start of something lasting. We invite all interested people and participants to fill this FrameADate link so we can organize the next gathering. At that event you will all be given a reworked paper version of the outcome of the workshop. If you have any propositions or ideas you can contact Edgeryders or myself: yannick.schandene@gmail.com  
Vision A holistic, integral, evolutionary, self-directed and self-integrated community (civilization).PurposeTo continuously and consciously evolve toward our highest potential through resilient adaptation to experiential existence.To collaboratively design, develop, and implement the blueprint for an intentional need-fulfillment community where purposefully driven individuals are fulfilled in their development toward their highest potential state of human experience for themselves and all others.The CAPE Project has a low entrance barrier for collaborators, participators, and community builders. With that said, however, there can be a substantial learning curve when it comes to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of what is actually being proposed by the Project. It is important to remember that this community proposal represents an entirely different linguistic worldview than most (if not all) other worldviews present in modern society. Fundamentally, the Community’s design describes an entirely divergent way of living and of understanding reality than the many worldviews expressed among the current population of the planet. This can present a significant motivating challenge for those interested in this direction. The design specifications are dense in content and many individuals who read them for the first time feel like they are learning a new language and integrating a new worldview, which takes time and requires internal processing.First Steps and Key FeaturesAs a first step we are going to establish a “Training and Research Network” - primarily for tertiary education | higher education - to enable educators to understand and facilitate the train of thought of an integral, holistic, evolutionary, self-directed, self-integrated and self-civilization and are looking for places to establish training and cultural exchange centers. With tis comes an network of self organizing solidly co-habitational care Nuklei.As we have to exist within a framework of formal-operational rules (orange), at best early vision-logic (green), we have to establish a set of “organizational-bodies” to support the idea in the best way possible.The key features have to be adapted as part of part of a living organisation! To date, our core themes are:New Learning Creating Creative Learning (Spaces)Communication Art integral News Communication Socio-Economic Development New socio-economic systems that focus on resource availability; experience an reserch a new way of care for each other including health care and social security aspects; develoopment of strategies for mental health and healty living environments;Integral Leadership, integral management systems living- and holonic organizations, Assessment, creating “Selforganizing Open Hierarchical Order” Systems, (olocracy) centre attention on the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course — from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability" Ervin LaszloSustainable Engineering and Application Application of sustainable energy production; High-Tech in ecological production processes.The design for the community is not yet sufficiently complete to plan its implementation. However, we presently have a ‘scope of work’, and we are in the process of converting it into a comprehensive project plan.We are initiateing multilingual communities and living space with people who focus primarily on inner development. Where we are working on our consciousness, because the crisis in our society is a crisis of consciousness. We shift our focus inwards, develop our relationship skills and transform our social programming. There should be as few fixed guidelines as possible concerning the personality and lifestyle of the members except the common to work toward a higher level of development. There are no ideologies, no dogmatic requirements and no fixed concepts.“ CAPE  aims to build a social net for the members, enacts "share & care" principles and provides a framework (legal body) for cooperative economy as well as a space for inter-generational "new", action based, co-operative learning. CAPE should be a special place for members and learners to revive, a place to flourish, a place for young and old. Sustainable mental health is a result of continuous enthusiasm to our own development and a willingness reconstruct our beliefs.   We, the initiators of CAPE LearnLust & Living think that the acceleration of our lives and the deluge of controversy, often absurd and paranoid information from an ailing socio-economic structure leads to the desire of many people for contemplation, inversion and a return to ethical values that are inherent to all human beings, but in "our experienced world" increasingly seem to disappear. Sincere joy, love for everything around us, to nature, compassion for each other, time to talk, to feel and enjoy, no longer being so tense and stretched - internally driven, yet not knowing where to go.  Autonomous and healthy life for the young and the joyful old. To create the miracle called "we", which awakens us to renewed life! To unmask the process of maturing as ripening and getting wise. Therefore, we are now tackling this … What do we perceive? Today our society offers almost unlimited possibilities. This diversity can lead us humans to exhaustion, confusion and disorientation, to sensory overload, burnout! Therefore, every human being is faced with the challenge of finding answers to the following questions: Who am I really? Why am I here? Who or what gives me meaning and footing? What is my inherent value? Where do I want to go? Our goal is to develop as a group to the extent that we understand each other at the height of the developmental stage now possible. These levels of human development are researched and described scientifically. It does not matter at what age we come together, it's fun and is exciting to get to know thyself and develop. As pioneers of a new action based, co-operative learning we share our special talents and skills with those interested. We are convinced that sustainable social change in the global community depends on the quality of personal development, training and the ability to effectively and constructively communicate with others. The focus is on interaction and cooperation, shared responsibility and authority, and the improvement of critical thinking. There is no 'teacher' in the traditional sense. Learning will be self-organizing, dynamically adjusted to needs and ideas of the "learners".
Breast cancer – the burden and early diagnosis Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women both in the developed and less developed world. It is estimated that worldwide over 508,000 women died in 2011 from breast cancer (Global Health Estimates, WHO 2013). This represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women. In all countries, early detection remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival. In health systems with developed infrastructure, physicians regularly examine the breast as part of a routine female check-up (usually once or twice a year) in addition to mammography. However, this routine procedure is  provided at varying levels of time investment and care. discovering hands has a number of advantages: By using the extraordinary sensory capabilities of visually impaired women, a perceived “disability” is transformed into a capability. A completely new field of meaningful employment is created. “Medical Tactile Examiners” (MTEs) are trained to deliver physical breast examinations at doctors’ practices. During a 9-month training period they learn how to use a standardized diagnostic method for examining the female breast. Additionally, all MTEs are trained in communication skills and breast-specific psychology, as well as administrative tasks typically carried out by a doctor’s assistant. MTEs are either directly employed by resident doctors or hospitals, or they work for different practices and/or hospitals on a freelance basis. Conventionally, a regular breast examination carried out by a gynecologist takes between 1 and 3 minutes. The discovering hands MTE invests at least 30 minutes for each session, not only examining the breast, but also educating patients on how to cope with the risk of breast cancer. Patients feel that they are well taken care of and receive the best possible preventive examination in a pleasant environment. Preliminary qualitative results, conducted by the University of Essen, show that MTEs detect ~50% more and ~28% smaller tissue alterations in the breast than doctors (5-8mm vs. 10-15mm). A clinical, peer reviewed study is currently being conducted at the University of Erlangen. Our vision We are operating as a social business because we believe in the our value proposition (to the healthcare sector, and institutions supporting people with disabilities). We are committed to the social "win-win" of our model: offering meaningful employment to blind women, and creating an opportunity for them where they have competitive strength; and helping to improve the breast cancer early identification situation and awareness for the most common cancer among women. Current roll-out Discovering hands is planning to substantially increase the number of MTEs in the years to come. We currently operate in Germany and in Austria. In both India and Colombia we have pilot projects running with scale-up in planning. And we are interested in further country roll-out, which we operate through a social franchise. If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to implement discovering hands in your country, contact us Also, if you are an impact investor and are interested in collaborating with us to further roll-out the model, please contact us too. We are interested in hearing from you! http://www.discovering-hands.de

Imagine the City started in 2009 aiming to redefine the processes and relationships that shape the image and experience of contemporary Greek cities. An informal, open team of young people interested in design and architecture started to host weekly meetings to discuss issues such as: What are the criteria that define public works in Greek cities? Why do public spaces and urban environments in our country not reflect the creative human potential we have in the fields of design, architecture, and urban planning? How can we change the way citizens interact with and take care of the public space?In the past 7 years, the project has created a social platform in physical spaces, where citizens have the opportunity to be informed, discuss and consider the possibilities of improving their quality of life and imagine their city in a different way, with the higher aim to participate in decision-making processes about urban infrastructure and public works. Imagine the City develops public exhibitions in different Greek cities in which local architects, designers, urban planners and artists showcase their proposals, ideas, solutions, and plans for each city, enhanced by a series of parallel urban events.After the success of the first exhibition in the city of Chalkis in 2009, instead of accepting invitations to organize similar exhibitions in other cities, we created a digital manual documenting our experience, tools and guidelines, which was made openly available to other local teams to use and develop. The result is that Imagine the City has organically been developed in 13 Greek cities by interdisciplinary teams that bring together local authorities, businesses, universities and civil society groups. Exhibitions have hosted over 400 proposals by 650 creators. Two hundred parallel events have taken place and over 100.000 citizens have participated in the different activities. The manual is being evolved and includes from branding guidelines to fundraising and public engagement tips.The exhibits consist of material that participants have developed as students and researchers in the framework of academic projects in Greece or abroad, or as professionals with a social responsibility or interest to promote their work. The proposals suggest aesthetic and functional improvements of cultural, touristic or environmental importance through sketches, videos, and 3D models. The parallel urban events are developed exclusively for each city, focusing on the dissemination of information, knowledge, and perceptions to the local community, encouraging the participation of youth and children to experimental efforts to transform the urban space. Through debates, presentations, workshops and urban interventions we release knowledge about urban development, shed light on unknown sides of each city and create common ground for new partnerships to emerge at the local level.  The trans-local and self-organised character of Imagine the City has activated the dynamic involvement of academic and public institutions, formal and informal teams, local businesses and simple citizens.Beyond the discussions on local issues, Imagine the City has provoked a public dialogue of the political decision-making and planning processes in Greece, it has questioned the way we inhabit public spaces and has promoted a different urban culture in which citizens propose, evaluate, co-decide, activate and take care of the public space.At the same time, the community created the ground for a series of spin-off projects: From IDEATOPOS, the first panhellenic conference on Place Marketing and Branding to SynOikia Pittaki, a participatory light installation that became a landmark of Athens, to Politeia 2.0, a platform for political innovation to redesign the Greek Constitution from the bottom-up. The need to scale up these projects led to the creation of the non-profit organization Place Identity, which acts as a cluster of projects for urban regeneration and political innovation.I initiated Imagine the City as a young designer interested in strategic and participatory design. Since then, it has evolved from a “think tank” to a “platform” to a “trans-local community”. Myself, as the initial “caller” and “facilitator” and other people that got involved in the project coordination, allowed for systematic experimentation and risk-taking. The collectives that gradually joined our mission gave an unexpected dynamic to the project. Every now and then, we attempted to identify and showcase the ingredients and values that released creativity and joy within our network, causing a multiplier effect in local communities.Throughout the years, we experienced many difficult moments and failures which nevertheless shaped our success. When we failed to gain official partnerships with Municipalities and Universities, we decided to reach directly to the academics, students, and citizens. When we failed to launch the digital Imagine the City platform, we decided to focus on the relationships and processes that are required in the physical space and it turned out this served our local teams better. Every collective challenge can become a step to a new collective insight and result in practical social innovation.In order to change the image and the experience of a city, you have to observe an entire system and not be afraid by its complexity. You need to face the public procurement processes for urban works, architecture competitions, political decision-making and the separation of powers. You need to rethink your role as the citizen, to understand deeply how a Democracy ought to function, to establish the political rights that you are not aware of. Otherwise, the city (polis) becomes an arena of conflicting material and psychological interests and soon gets out of control.Through communities of care that work for a common cause, you learn how to trust the other, and thus one’s self. Unfortunately, in our country, we show to one another and to our society more suspicion and blame than trust and empathy. Maybe we keep reflecting society whatever we fail to manage within us. Maybe this is why Greek society still fails to “grow up”.A community of change can only be facilitated if you are open, transparent and if you manage to demonstrate collective audacity while remaining the custodian of a team’s shared values. When success triggers humility and difficulties spark evolution.If you ask me about the future of Imagine the City, personally, I would like it to see it evolve into something I cannot even imagine today, just the way I could not imagine the way it would evolve to date since we first started. I wish it could catalyze holistic solutions for the challenges faced by contemporary cities. As for now, Imagine the City has reached the closure of a first cycle. Interest from new cities to join has decreased significantly and those teams that have been activated in the past are unable to scale their activities without systematic organizational and financial support. Due to the financial crisis, local businesses cannot afford financial or in-kind sponsorships to fund urban activities. At the same time, larger sponsors are not interested in supporting projects in smaller cities due to limited promotion opportunities. However, there is a growing interest in research and training opportunities related to Imagine the City and the processes that could truly empower and scale our trans-local community.We are considering to launch the Imagine the City Academy: a trans-local training program that will support local interdisciplinary teams who develop prototype urban regeneration projects focusing on citizens’ engagement. Building on past experience and existing local teams, we wish to promote action research on new models of managing public works to design holistic solutions that respond to the real needs of cities and local communities. The Academy could offer administrative, educational and financial support for local teams to exchange know-how, apply participatory tools, develop policy proposals and materialize prototype urban interventions. This program has been budgeted at 270.000€ for a period of 5 years. The first year would focus on mapping the results and analyzing the needs of local teams so far, as well as process design for the program. The second would entail an open call, dissemination campaign and activation of cross-sector partnerships at the local level. The actual training program and project development phase of local projects would be in years 3 and 4. In the last year, we would evaluate results of local projects and make participatory policy proposals to tackle the systemic issues that suffocate creativity and participation in urban planning in Greece.I work as a freelance designer and have a small company, theSwitch, which I co-founded in 2005 with a group of friends. While working on branding and designing professional spaces, I started working on methodologies of strategic and participatory design and I got involved in a series of social projects. In social projects, by design, I try to apply principles of self-organisation, self-sufficiency, sustainability, and independent financing but for the moment I cannot claim that I have managed to achieve the results I aim for… I think that in our country it is even more difficult due to the financial breakdown and the close networks of power. Often, sponsorships tend to manipulate projects or connect them to certain political agendas. We have also experienced funding programs that can destroy something truly innovative through their bureaucratic mechanisms or to make it easier for society to digest. I consider as my main personal goal to be professional, financially and politically independent so as to be open to collaboration, respecting a predefined set of values and encouraging substantial progress.My involvement in public affairs started from my teenage years, in the city where I grew up where I was part of the scout's community and a student magazine team. I have spent innumerable hours volunteering in my life, yet I am against “volunteering” as an end in itself, or as a “culture” that apparently needs to be cultivated. I believe that Greece was never short of “philotimo” (love of honor) and “meraki” (love in doing), solidarity and social care actions. However organized civil society is not recognized in our constitution and our institutions, its positive impact neither being acknowledged nor encouraged.What we need to cultivate today is a culture of holistic and creative problem-solving. Communities do not need volunteers but of citizens committed to solving problems – not just pointing out issues and ideas! I mean, solving problems in practice. If we do not take the responsibility of applying what we believe in, even in pilot projects, if we do not create new paradigms and do not experience political maturity, then we can keep talking politics (“politika”) but we cannot live as citizens (“polites"). Before sticking to political identities and ideologies, we need to achieve political rights and the freedom that will enable mixed policy and governance models. Instead of allowing closed networks of power to define our lives, these governance models could facilitate communities of action for the common good and the interests of the Polis.
The ‘Big Bang Schools’ is a new educational approach and a new type of schools that are re-designed for an era of exponential technological advance and social change. The project seeks to create innovation labs for real human challenges and the planet, helping shape the future instead of repeating the past. It is considered as a catalyst for a new civilization paradigm of joining forces towards “upgrading humanity”.We used the name ‘Big Bang’ in a symbolic way to highlight the explosion of new ideas and the creation of brand new knowledge from scratch. A new Big Bang of Creation is about to start at Thessaloniki in the following 2 years (2018) hoping that the idea will expand to other Greek cities and abroad. A school where learning is accomplished experientially, in harmony and interaction with the natural environment, aiming to lead children on a wonderful quest.Central in our philosophy is that educational activities must take place within the natural environment and the whole procedure must be supported through workshops where pupils have the opportunity to discover and connect with new information. Our educational approach encourages the development of capacities through observation, flexibility, adaptability, evaluation, goal setting and self-confidence in order to create their own path of life.The Big Bang Schools are furthering the vision of our initial project, the “School of Nature and Colours”. This is an educational role model of creative self-management, in which pupils are taught beyond the curriculum how to learn in-depth, sing, dance, stage theatrical plays, raise funds for their school through a vegetable garden and make their activities and campaigns are known to the public using social media.In this framework, we organize a unique Creative Centre for our children which we called BIG BANG after SCHOOL’. This is a comprehensive program for elementary school children and kindergarten, where all participants are able to connect with music, cinema, dance, theater, arts as well as workshops in creative thinking, constructions, architecture and engineering. Additionally, we created a specific program for elementary courses such as science, history, philosophy and multilingualism. In this project, everyone is welcome to contribute in different ways besides financial support. This is a project designed to benefit children and parents who seek for alternative educational methods of learning and interacting with people and the natural environment.My name is Angelos Patsias, an educator on my 30s who aims to launch various innovative activities that will help create a new educational system that will meet the specific needs of each and every place. I started my studies in Primary Level Education at the Democritus University of Thrace and I am currently reading issues for an MA candidate at the Faculty of Sociology at the University of Crete. My philosophy of life encourages me to encounter every difficult circumstance as an opportunity, and at the same time, I strongly believe that returning to the simple meaning of life is an essential action.My partner, Veta Georgiadou has been a kindergarten teacher in public schools for 22 years. Our collaboration in “Big Bang Schools’ project started when she watched my TEDx speech about ‘Breaking the walls between school and society’. As she usually says: ‘Children are the best tutors because they believe in miracles, the life at a present time, are full of enthusiasm and are creating all the time’. She studied pedagogics, eventually becoming a wife and mother of three children and her constant self-searching voyage with pupils, parents, teachers, who never stop learning and reforming is still ongoing.The third partner, Yiannis Sotirakos, is a serial entrepreneur developing projects and technologies towards “Upgrading Humanity”, and innovative educational and edutainment platforms to empower the youth.
FRONTIZO (“I care” in Greek) is an initiative taken in 2009, by some people who are either professional or have some relation to the elderly and disabled individuals in the city Patras. We saw that there were substantial needs to be covered, so we felt it was appropriate to make such a collective effort to mainly support individuals belonging to these vulnerable groups.With a rapidly increasing elderly population in Greece, our aim is to highlight and defend the rights of the elderly. There are many things that the wider public doesn’t know, such as specificities of various incurable diseases, so we started to create synergies and partnerships to cover these needs.Today, there are 200,000 patients with dementia in Greece, corresponding to 6% of the total elderly population. These figures are certainly expected to increase. Current projections double the number of elderly by 2050, something that will undoubtedly affect these numbers. Therefore, the services and efforts to be made collectively are large and need to be further strengthened.At the beginning, there was no clear knowledge on the issues and needs of elderly assistance. We could not identify these people, because in Greece there are no structures -and structured policy, in general- for dementia. Therefore, it was not easy for people to understand the benefits of our actions, which had to be communicated by word of mouth from scratch. Those initial difficulties were overcome as our interventions started becoming more visible, and as the spirit of cooperation developed with the patients and their caregivers over time.We are interested in entering the homes of these people because in most times they do not even get out of their homes. It's not the same to meet with them in a public institution, compared to entering into their homes.Since we cannot do many things by ourselves, establishing collaborations is imperative for the expansion of our operations and to ensure resources. We work with the local government, mainly the Region of Western Greece, and with associations of patients with whom we organize activities and events for the dissemination of knowledge and solidarity. Through those collaborations with diverse stakeholders, we acquire more knowledge in dementia, and the training of family carers.Our interventions occur in physical and mental level, helping the recovery process and educating caregivers on how they can give proper care. This is done by a team consisting of a social worker, a trainer, a physiotherapist and a nurse. The aim is to keep the patients’ good aspects, to maintain their functional and mental status (such as orientation, memory, etc.) and assist them with their behavior. Many times, these people have a lot of stress, anxiety or depression, so they calm through our intervention. Caregivers, who are not aware of basic issues before entering the program, receive training that allows them to continue their work after the end of the intervention, which always has a specific duration. These people are very actively looking for information and, as we enter their home, there is a direct interaction. We have observed a reduction of the stress and burden felt by of caregivers. Let us not forget that we live in a difficult time and they are people who have their own issues (family, finances, etc.), so the pressure is too high. Of course, all our services are free.We are very satisfied with the hitherto results of our initiative. Because from a point where there was nothing and the state has not been completely inactive in this field, we now see that more and more caregivers seek for our advice. Through the creation of partnerships and through hard work, this effort is now recognized. At the local level, the authorities understand the value of our work and want to support us to further evolve these services.What we also observe, is an increasing flow of volunteers. We continue to do actions within the community, targeting the general elderly population, and offering information and tips on healthy lifestyle, diet, and exercise. The beneficiaries may come in contact with our activities digitally, via the website and through social networks.In general, there is a lack of public understanding about the issue of dementia in Greece. Therefore, the response to our call was not so evident at the beginning, due to this ignorance. We had to face, of course, the classic issues the grassroots initiatives are facing in Greece. For example, the fact that the state was very slow in harmonizing the legislation on how organizations of civil society should operate. Since then, however, as our activities were broadly communicated and because the program is organized in 6-month long circles, there was an increase in the number of both beneficiaries and volunteers. We currently serve 20 people in each circle, and we have so far registered about 60 people (patients and their families). By the end the year, we estimate to have surpassed 3000 home visits.In FRODIZO, we are all young people and the whole intervention is non-medical. This is why at the beginning, there was suspicion towards our actions. Over time, we have generated significant experience, as well as a database of beneficiaries facing problems related to dementia, and their carers. Hence, we now feel more confident and secure, since we have been in direct contact with the challenge for so long. Also, we were able to get in touch with larger organizations, developed teamwork and discipline because these interventions must be always characterized by formality and consistency.Broadly speaking, we cannot cover all needs by ourselves, because they are huge. We want to attract more people around us to meet the challenge in the best possible way. Dealing with this kind of work is a special opportunity for young scientists who can provide major services to society, especially to its most vulnerable parts. These actions deserve to be recognized by the society, to be studied and supported.
The other day cycling home, I saw a person, probably living with spinal cord injury using his hands to pedal, a really rare sight in Italy. I’m a keen cyclist for transport and leisure, but my profession is also research in devices enhancing the mobility for people with physical limitations. Therefore I feel an obligation to spread the news about recent advancements in cycling for physically challenged. Have you heard about FES cycling?FES - short for functional electrical stimulation - can be used to activate paralyzed muscles by impulses imitating the nervous system in the most natural way possible. We have come a long way with our research and it is possible to use this technique to let people with paralyzed legs cycle again. For some reason there are very few people who know about this so I’d like to share this knowledge with you.We cycle to move, but also to maintain fit. It can be both fun and functional. But, if your legs don't obey you anymore, you will probably not consider it a possibility. Paralyzed legs can result from an accident breaking your back, a stroke or a sneaking disease like the multiple sclerosis.  People caring for and curing you need to be very pragmatic, and you with them. Mobility then becomes reduced to passive transport, a dietetic approach to avoiding getting fat and medication of pressure sores and other side effects from lack of physical exercise. That’s where the publicly unknown FES research comes into play. Years of clinical research have consolidated the benefits, but we need to spread the news and understand more about it. Some people may already have heard of handbikes. They allow you to cover greater distances than manual wheelchairs. They are special tricycles where you use the hands for pedaling.FES, on the other side, is applied via adhesive electrodes or incorporated in bicycle shorts. The stimulus activates the muscles of the buttocks and thighs in sync with the ride.  However only the leg muscles can challenge the cardiovascular system to get physically fit. Some people with for example spinal cord injury (paraplegia) may be able to use FES for activating these large muscles.  With FES cycling they can cover greater distances with greater speed and due to activation of large muscles they get (bene-)fit and feel physical well-being. The research community has tried to promote a more widespread use of FES cycling by arranging races (see here) and publications with the user's statements of the pros and cons (see here).How can we build research into practice or at least make options much more accessible?The question is how to help people who have become paraplegic or their families know about the existence of such possibilities. FES bikes are quite expensive so where to go to try them? Many places and cycle lanes are missing so it requires some changes to infrastructure as well. But as long as nobody uses them it's a vicious circle. Therefore we need more awareness to reduce cost, change infrastructure and increase inclusion in the cycle communityEven handbikes which are more popular can’t be bought in a normal bicycle shop, but rather directly from a few specialized companies. The lack of marketing incurs high costs to manufacturers and hence to clients.My own group’s response as research and practitioners is to create a culture to promote this change, a project in the making. How can we promote actual experience based dialogue between users (who are maybe hackers) and researchers? There is an international community of researchers, so there should be a good chance of of finding local experts. As someone with a disability, you could connect with them and hack - evolve - test collaboratively cheap functional solutions in a healthcare hacking space. Dr Fitzwater, who is both a researcher and FES cycler, reports on the need to make benefits enjoyable in addition to positive medical outcomes: “The FESC function should be capable of being used on the open road with or without friends and family and be easily usable without any more assistance than that already required for the activities of daily living”.Why should you, me or anyone care about the future of research? you want to see your tax money spent well, don’t you? And most importantly, this could be you or a relative who would like to go for a ride and have drastically limited options. Check out the coming cybathlon for more information and help us spread the news.The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
What if we could create a network of independent, highly connected, care homes? They would be innovative, fairly priced and an integral part of their local community. They would be great places to work, and run for the benefit of all, not to maximize profit or subject to the whims of governments. That’s our dream. A bit of background: The care industry in the UK is in crisis (the BBC recently called it the problem no one can fix).  It is a familiar story.  The demand for care is growing rapidly due mainly to an ageing population, with increasingly complex conditions, a breaking down of traditional community-provided care, and higher expectations amongst the elderly.At the same time, the ability of government-funded institutions to meet those needs is diminishing. They lack the resources, the responsiveness and the political will to deal with the population’s increasingly complex care needs.At the same, escalating asset prices are putting pressure on traditional providers, and attracting hedge funds and private equity looking for the "growth opportunities”.  The result is that many care home are being run as a businesses more than as a service, meaning that profit and shareholder value is prioritised over the needs and well-being of residents or staff.Caring for Life is a diverse team has come together to seek a better solution. We are inspired by:open source communities, that harness collective intelligence to find new solutions to old problems;networked organisations, notably Buurtzorg, the community care provider in the Netherlands, that combine the benefits of being small with the benefits of being part of something large.traditional community-based approaches to care-giving that are human-centred and sustainable.We intend to will achieve this in particular by taking over existing care home businesses and creating, one-by-one, a network of homes modelling the type of care we want to see.  Once we have established a small number of our own homes, we will reach out to other like-minded operators to create a broader community of homes around the UK.A key operating principle will be to involve all "stakeholders".  Buurtzorg (mentioned above) has an excellent model, illustrating the various levels of involvement, and whilst this is primarily looking at home care as opposed to care homes, it is a useful way of viewing the bigger picture.Care home residents come into care with social networks, habits, routines and pastimes, which are normally stripped away on entering care. As far as possible these should be maintained because these are part of the person's "support system". Involving the family and friends as well as the wider community will, whilst it may add to the complexity, lighten the burden of care and increase quality of life for all affected.Legal structure:  Our intention is to separate out the capital assets from the business of caring. The precise legal structure remains to be worked out but may be similar to a so-called community land trust (see http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts) where one organisation (maybe a charity) owns the freehold of the land and a social enterprise runs the care home.  There would be some element of employee ownership, which has been shown in many businesses to encourage higher than average levels of productivity and profitability.Getting started:  Our intent is to start by acquiring control of one care home.  In order to keep capital needs as low as possible in the early stages, the intention is to lease premises on a long-term lease rather than buying a home. An opportunity has been identified near the south coast of England and conversations have started with the owners.  This is an interesting opportunity, in particular because there is an chance to acquire the property and business for a low price.  The home is currently subject to "special measures”, imposed by the Care Quality Commission.
‘What people experiencing mental health difficulties need most is to be shown compassion, empathy, a voice, to be listened to, to be believed in, somewhere to go where they will be given hope of a more meaningful life.’Cosáin Community Wellness is a recent initiative to develop a peer-led community-based support system for people with emotional distress and mental health issues, and to promote wellness for all. Cosáin is the Irish word for ‘pathways', reflecting our belief in different paths not single roads, and the guidance, wisdom and support that we can find in the stories of each others individual journeys. All quotes within this article are from research performed by Galway Mental Health Services Consumer Panel, the local representative body of mental health service users for the geographic region.GMHSCP advocates for supports and services which are fit for purpose from the perspective of service users, and the integration of users of services into the design,  development and delivery of services, working in partnership with the Irish Health Services (HSE) based on the value of our lived experience of current systems of care, and the evidence of our own healing processes.‘The most effective help I have experienced over the years, having had years of medication, psychotherapy, hospitalisation, is the support of peers, where I am treated as normal, with kindness, not judged, and not expected to conform to the medical model of treatment.’Where progress was slow or absent within the system, we took it upon ourselves to prototype and demonstrate how necessary supports could be delivered in partnership and collaboration between health providers, community groups, and local authorities based on a cooperative ethos of mutual support. We believe our approach will be of value and benefit because‘it's a community based project concerned with 'well-being' which is preparing fertile ground for the empowerment and transformation of people, individually and as a group. It's organic growth reflects the personalities and desires of the people involved, making it of and for the people.’Our belief is that properly resourced and equipped communities can provide more effective intervention in cases of crisis, care in a more person-centred and human manner, and both at a lower cost than the dominant acute-oriented, clinical and biomedical approaches. We believe that only approaches that are grounded in local communities and emerge from their dreams and aspirations can meet the needs which we are presented with in the time that we have.‘My experience of large organisations is that the individual gets lost in the system and become just another number… I’m sick and tired of waiting for the HSE to offer people the support they want’We also believe that the act of mutual support is amongst the most therapeutic of acts, transforming relationships from ones of being a recipient and subject of care, to a space of autonomy, collective development, peer provision and mutual reliance that involves people in generating their own solutions.‘Being with people who are doing whatever we can to have our lives the way we want them, seeing the evidence that people can succeed, that we can make a difference – all this has a positive effect on my own mental health, self-esteem and my ability to shape my life the way I want it.’We developed our initiative over the course of the Galway 2020 Bid process, using  participatory design exercises that brought together a range of groups and individuals including independent therapists, health professionals, service users and patients, and other interested parties who are seeking to develop new models of community-based health promotion and care. We then used the blank canvas of a disused city building, visioning and combining elements of artspace, green makerspace, and wellness supports that were brought together using the concept of an integrated cultural and community hub. During this time we came into contact with EdgeRyders and the Opencare research project, and welcomed the opportunity to form productive partnerships at European level with groups and initiatives with similar ethos.Our current operating model exists with the support of Galway City Museum, who have provided us with the use of a room one day a week for prototyping and co-design. This is taking place as part of the Galway City Cultural Strategy, which seeks to use  cultural resources and infrastructure for wellness supports and public health. These sessions were an extension of the earlier co-design process, deployed in a real-life environment for feedback from stakeholders and re-design. Our sessions to date have included artistic and creative process, peer support and educational sessions, based on the demand from service users. Currently delivered on a volunteer basis for proof of concept, our intent is to progress towards a cultural space and ‘crisis cafe’ on a social enterprise model, with a welcoming cafe-type front-of-house drop-in space that can be used as an open studio and learning space, with a supportive backstage of more intensive interventions, therapies and supports for those people in emotional distress. Our model is grounded in the value and authenticity of provision of supports and services that are delivered by people with the direct personal experience of the situations in question, and the expressed need based on our research for appropriate creative outlets that support emotional wellbeing and generate meaning and community for the participants.‘in Irish culture mental health tends to be seen as a failing by an individual, of an individual, in an individual. This attitude views the natural processes of emotional distress and recovery through a lens of pathology, individualised blame, guilt and shame. In contrast, rather than attempt to seek what Zygmunt Bauman called ‘individual solutions to collective problems’, an impossible task, we felt the need for the sake of our collective sanity, to use an approach based on collective support and interdependence.Our story is just beginning.
The initiative started as an idea in 2012 when I was a student in high school. The occasion was the need for blood by the grandmother of a friend. The inability to find blood in the hospital on the island of Lemnos, made me realize the problem. Through this incident, I realized that although all people have blood in them when someone needs it, it is too difficult to find.At university, I found another two friends that helped me create Blood-e in 2014. We are all graduates of the department of Management Science & Technology, each  one with a different specialization. Our training helped a lot as a starting point because we knew about the management of an organization, and how we can make use of new media and technologies. But we also encountered difficulties. It took us a lot of time at the beginning, to see how we can technology meet our purpose. Also, we were only 19 years old and, as students, we didn’t know so much about the complexities of our cause. In times, it felt like we were on a ship in the middle of the storm, and didn’t know where we were going.All of us come from families that communicated the values of volunteering from a very  young age. Therefore our families were our first recruits. We started by organizing a series of blood donations in Athens and then created a digital platform where people who with a need for blood can notify suitable donors. Slowly, we started having a better understanding of how to motivate people and cultivate the culture of volunteering and donating.Greece is not the ideal environment to start something, but there are people in the public and private sectors that will listen and can help. Unfortunately, the legal framework for social entrepreneurship is very cloudy, resources are limited and opportunities for fundraising are minimal. There is, of course, huge bureaucracy, with regard to information about how to establish an entity. Over time, though, we have managed to overcome internal organizational issues, but also to find some resources to start our action.Blood-e has to do with the motivation to get someone out of the house and go give blood on a voluntary basis. Hence, we work with various organizations, communities and the National Centre for Blood Donation. We try to create synergies and collaborations, aiming to maximize the value and social impact of the project.Blood donations is an official responsibility of the Ministry of Health. The collection, testing and transfusion is only possible in public hospitals. When someone needs blood, he/she usually invites a relative or friend. Apart from the moral aspects, this also has some safety implications. When somebody gives blood with motivation other than volunteering, it is easier to lie to medical questions on medical history that made the donation. As a result, there are many patients who cannot find suitable blood, and receive infected blood.Through Blood-e, human needs are met in real time. The donor knows where his/her blood goes. The contact with volunteers continues after the donation through the digital community, where everyone can find material on blood donation and blood. The environment in which someone gives blood is also important. Instead of the sterile hospital environment, we organise collections at working space, or along with friends. This generates an experience that people will want to repeat at some point in their life.Compared to these rates existing in the country, where only 50% of total blood needs are covered by voluntarily donations, we feel satisfied with the results of Blood-e. Certainly, it could be much better. We are trying to see what new things emerge, in order to create a culture around blood donation, aiming to grow the  rates of blood donations coming from volunteers, while striving to cover the needs.From the very beginning, there was a positive response from the public. Eighty percent of our volunteers are young, and give blood for the first time. in their life. We especially target young people and students, who have never given blood before. We are very satisfied with the response, which is not in line with the percentage of blood donated in the country. Our goal is doubling every six months the volunteer base that we have in our platform.What we propose is different and changes the mentality of the public hospitals. Our initial thought was to integrate this information system in the official health care system. This means that the hospitals would notify any needs, rather than the patients. This requires, of course, the collaboration of public hospitals.In the future, we want to launch a series of games in schools for children. Beyond that, we wish to continue growing the number of volunteers. We approach this through partnerships with companies and organisations, which can unite our message, to strengthen voluntary blood donations.What is missing in our team, are people with a medical background, who are willing and want to engage with new technologies and such initiatives. Due to lack of resources, we cannot support more staff. Most young people also imagine themselves in a for-profit environment, rather than a social enterprise. They believe that either you have to be a volunteer, or to make money. Therefore it is difficult to find people who fit in our philosophy and our own needs.We have a demanding job, where we talk with people who fight very difficult diseases and a blood donation might be their last hope. Especially when talking about platelets or bone marrow. Some of them die. In our everyday lives, we are facing very difficult circumstances. But the feeling that remains at the end of the day, is fulfilling for what we do and offer. This balances the psychological stress and bad feelings that arise in times.Within Blood-e, we have created a philosophy of continuous education. We started something that we did not have the knowledge to implement, but eventually learned to do. As for skills, we have developed whatever has to do with digital marketing and communication and how to run a business. As well as the psychology of how to contact volunteers, patients and partners. Beyond that, we created a lot of soft skills. Namely, how to persevere, to have audacity and tolerance. To ignore those that say that “these things cannot be done”, to respect that many partnerships will not be successful, but always keep on.This is necessary for operating in a country that huge institutional gaps exist. Social entrepreneurship in Greece is a concept still quite unknown. There is no much public understanding of its benefits, but it is something that is slowly growing. What we do is to look at things with optimism. The country is missing optimistic voices, that -while recognizing that things are difficult- they strive to change things.
Sucre Blue is a program that strives to create a chronic disease health care model to bring affordable access to medical treatment to people with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease in Bangalore. It’s a challenging setting to work in. One has to think that in these communities there is no doctors, hospitals or medical treatment in place. Access to treatment is  extremely limited (for diabetics as well - many forms are absent, some not always available, most of them too expensive anyway) and families earn 2 dollars per day. Many patients’ diabetes is caused by malnutrition, despite the common conception that it is a rich people’s condition. I often see blind children who lost their sight because their families lacked access to medication or means to purchase them. And all that in India, with the second fastest growth of diabetes in the world, and 70 percent of the population living in rural areas. Which makes it extremely difficult to identify those in need and ensure they’re given help.For the past years, I have lived in India - partly in a hospital, without being paid, and I had a chance to see how the system works. As a diabetic myself, I’ve experienced the hardships of managing my own illness and needed to adapt to available solutions.As an answer to this challenge, we are building a sustainable, and affordable model that could be replicated in other communities, across India and beyond. The service is based on dozens of patients and caregivers, who are being trained to provide other members of the community with door-to-door assistance. Our Community Health Workers in the pilot area conduct free screenings (sugar level, BMI, pressure monitoring) and check for diabetes and other health problems  - which they can later address according to the needs of each of the patients. An important component of this work is building relationships between the patients and the leaders - and help to establish links between those in needs and institutions that could provide them with further help. We also provide patients with free medicine. On top of that, we educate, bring awareness and help with early detection of potential issues. Many pre-diabetics in India could avoid becoming ill by changes in their dietary habits - and the diet is large to blame here.Such screenings would not only help to support those who suffer from diabetes but extend preventive care and potentially save millions of dollars in treating more complex effects of diabetes, such as dialysis and other complications. Beyond that, we’re helping some of the diabetics to overcome their poverty, as managing their problems costs ¼ of their income, pushing them to extreme poverty. Providing free treatment and medication is essential for them to improve their quality of life.On top of that, we equip our workers with SMS technology that allows them to collect the daily logs and patient's’ history - which will be stored in an open source database available to any researcher in the world. Otherwise, such information about chronically sick citizens of rural India is basically impossible to acquire.We plan to transform Sucre Blue into a model that could be replicated by communities all over the world - with a peer-based approach, designed to deal with chronic diseases. In India, we engage women in our work - mostly those who suffer from diabetes themselves. It is a way to change a bit disproportionate representation of men in healthcare - and it empowers women in the society.  Having their personal approach to diabetes allows us to change the opinion around the disease, often perceived as a curse, for example forbidding some of the ill to get married.
Solutions and problems have not so much to do with each other. Solutions are there without the problem. We need to stop looking at the problems and just start focussing on solutions all around us. Problems will not thrive in a solution focused mindset. I studied Family science and Solution focused cognitive Therapy. I have a lot of friends who work with the same mindset and can live the authentic happines without being attached to anything. Le me learn this to people who want to evolve in their feelings of happines and the dull distractions of stress. By motivational speech and a focus towards what does work I can make groups see different towards a situation so solutions come up that have nothing to do with the problem but yet as if by magic, the problem will dissapear. I follow 3 main principles trough out this proces. We need to be aware of our Self towards Nature, our Self towards Others and our Self towards our Self. 
Garden of LifeWe chose the name 'Garden of Life'  for our After School projects, as we believe that every child is like a different flower, and if nourished in mind, body and spirit, will blossom all together to make this world a beautiful garden. We understand that connecting with nature helps raise our consciousness and that brings out the best of everyone; our learning model raises our students mind, body and soul through sun, earth, technics in mindfulness, respect for one another, other living creatures, and themselves. Each flower needs watering and nurturing and for them to blossom, we need patience to let each one discover their own potentialities and dare to live them.MissionWe are an International Academy and After School projects, empowering a new generation with life skills and tools to reach higher consciousness allowing them to discover the seed of genius that they are born to be. We encourage them to explore and find their passion through a strong connection with nature and one another, respect for themselves, alongside latest technology and a diverse array of opportunities to aid in bringing to light a balanced, joyful, skillful, intelligent and compassionate Human Being enabling them True Prosperity.VisionGarden of Life Academy shall empower its students to find their passion and to have a balanced, joyful, skillful, knowledgeable and compassionate life leading them to True Prosperity.Our academy will have presence world wide, creating a network (Garden Of Life Global Academy) as well as a teaching model easily replicable for those around the world who want to join us sharing this human and close to nature´s approach, that allows this model to be widely recognized as one of the best options for teaching life skills in After Schools. Discerning ParentsAre you disillusioned with your child's full education? Would you love for your child or children to learn in a family environment that personalizes rather than standardizes that extra education and where you are always welcomed to become involved? Would you wish for your child to not only be coached in academia from school, but also in ethics, life tools and how to connect to others, nature, growing and preparing healthy foods as well discover his or her full potential? Would you wish for your child an environment that brings out the genius we believe is within each and every one of us, through exposing them to many opportunities to explore what that is? Would you be thrilled if your child would learn not only to nurture others but themselves?The projects are for children from 6-12, whose parents wish for their child or children to have a full all round education that teaches those life skills that may not have been covered at school. The projects will provide a stimulating, yet family environment housed by those in the community that has a home that could accomadate 5/6 children after school. Someone that who would also benefit from this interaction. The training manual will cover all aspects of working with children to help them discover mindfullness and therefore their own true potential, growing gardens, activity and performing and visual Arts, The projects will wish to keep their numbers to a ratio of 5-6 children to each Garden of Life Teaching coaches or knowledgeable volunteers sharing their skills, from carpentry to journalism.Each project - The children will;Start  with clearing the mind and De-stressing  tools and create positive affirmations for themselvesThey will create,care and nurture gardens created in a small environment.Help prepare their own healthy snacks, learning to care and nurture themselvesLearn from knowledgeable skilled Volunteers in diverse fields in the local areaPlay music, dance, enjoy performing and visual arts and sports using all their sensesExplore group activities and group projectsBecome part of a growing Global Garden of Life network of other families and friends.and our ethos is:I hear I forget, I see I remember, I Do I understandWe can best help children learn by making the world accessible to them and helping them exploreStudy without desire spoils the memory and it retains nothing - Leonardo de VinciThe best teachers are those who show you where to look, but don't always tell you what to seeChildren must be taught how to think, not always what to thinkGrades do not measure intelligence and age does not define maturityTrue Prosperity is a Life full of love, passion, joy, compassion, health and well-BeingTools to learn how to work with the inevitable change and stress in life, is as essential as foodEvery child is like a different flower, and if nourished in mind, body and spirit, will all together make this world a beautiful gardenWith these examples implemented in our projects we know children can master anything they show passion for, and find the intelligence to help them achieve the success that is needed for their individual dreams and importantly, help them achieve True Prosperity in their lives.Michele Claiborne'As a Life Coach and Natural Healer for children and adults, I am so aware of the lack of life tools most have not been privy to learn. Everything from basic health and nutrition to people skills and coping with life's inevitable changes and stresses and how to follow their passions and live a life of what I call 'True Prosperity'. I am passionate, along with many others, to help the new generation in learning these tools. I have created an inspiring program for children through all my work and other renowned scholars, that truly makes a difference in the lives of the children, the families and eventually the planet. Give a child the right environment and the right approach to learning and I believe the child will blossom into his or her full potential, brimming with confidence, compassion, intelligence and passion for life. I feel privileged to have begun this challenge by opening up Garden of Life Academy After School projects first in New Orleans where it was founded but now it is ready to share this International vison!'

Hi all,My name is Frank Coughlin.  I'm based in New York City, NY, working as an Emergency Medicine doctor in the city's oldest public hospital.  I'm a member of 1882 Woodbine and one of the co-founders of the Woodbine Health Autonomy Resource Center.  We are an open access health resource center in the neighborhood of Ridgewood, NY.  We are involved in the creation of local health autonomy.  We are working to meld Western models and institutions of medicine with holistic and tradional skills.  Our goal is to build a foundation for health which allows us to use and manipulate health institutions to fit our needs, not to become dependent on them for our survival.  It is our aim that by addressing one of our basic human needs, health, it allows us the space to further ideals of revolutionary change in a world that seems designed to destroy us.  For more information on our projects, please see Woodbine Health Autonomy Center and After Occupy.  
In 2014, I had a solo museum exhibition at the Burchfield Penney Art Center. That project outlined the history and present conditions of the Scajaquada River. The river was buried under the city of Buffalo in the 1800’s as a way to keep from dealing with the smell and pollution found in the water. Parts of the river remain buried and it continues to be polluted even as it is monitored by state and federal organizations.  My research and installation took about three years to put together, and it presented the complexity of how economy, government policies, lack of planning, lack of accessible information and climate change can dramatically erode an environmental and cultural asset. It was during this installation that I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows though the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. I was excited about extending my body of work beyond the Western Hemisphere and to working with a culturally diverse community. After initial discussions with professionals, museum staff and community members in Kathmandu, it was clear that there was a great deal of interest in me starting a new project investigating the Bagmati River. I was granted a residency at the Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Center a few months later, and my research began in earnest. Jason Dilworth joined the venture early in 2016 and his work has been integral to the project’s success. During Jason’s and my first trip to Kathmandu in March of 2016, we were able to strengthen past connections to the project while building a larger network of individuals and groups committed to improving conditions in the Kathmandu Valley and the communities outside the valley who live along the river. Support for the Bagmati River Arts Project has grown steadily from the beginning through the assistance of Hatchfund donors, travel support through SUNY Fredonia and a Burchfield Penney Art Center grant. It has continued to grow through the sales of the project’s publications and the sales of my artwork. The Bagmati River Arts Project includes:A. an exhibition at the Siddhartha Art Gallery at Barbar Mahal Revisited in Kathmandu opening on November 20th, 2016. My artwork, water data from the Bagmati River and the video documentary will be presented on the second floor. The first will include artwork by Nepalese artists whose attention focuses with issues related to the Bagmati River. We are also working with the fine art faculty and students at Kathmandu University who will be creating work related to their cultural connections to the river.B. a book is being published (available in November 2016) that documents the importance of the Bagmati River, the cause for the pollution, climate change effects on the Kathmandu Valley and its groundwater, and plans to improve the condition of the river. The role of this publication, like the exhibition, is to use aesthetics as a way to make the scientific data accessible to a wider audience. Artists from the United States and Nepal will be included in the publication. The publication will be made available in Kathmandu at no cost to the residents to assure wide dissemination of its data to a diverse communities. It also will be available in the United States and sold as a way to fund other parts of this project and future projects. A link to this finished book is available on this website.C. a documentary video will document the project and include interviews with water quality and health professionals, community members as well a policy maker in Kathmandu. Songs by traditional Nepalese folk singers are incorporated throughout the video including a commissioned song about the Bagmati River. A link to this finished documentary is available on this website.D. a brochure and poster written in Nepalese will also provide important accessible scientific and health data about the river. The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river’s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We are working with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University’s School of Art, Center for Art and Design.All elements of the project listed above will be finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition in November 20, 2016 when Jason and I plan to return to Kathmandu.An exciting extension to this project is the plan to ship the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters back to the United States where it will tour around the country and, possibly, internationally. Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati’s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.  The Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.For more information please contact alberto@albertorey.com.  Project LeadersAlberto Rey – Distinguished Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and New Media at the State University of New York at Fredonia, Director and Founder of S.A.R.E.P.

There is a growing recognition about the negative effects stemming from commodifying innovation through restrictive I.P. protection and exclusivity, especially in the medical field. Open Source Development methodologies in software emerged as the dominant form of collaborative innovation in the late 90’s and the trend has been spreading to a wider sphere of work. The IT infrastructure of today’s world enables peers to connect, share and collaborate on solving common issues through use of collective knowledge. Commons-based peer production is the term that defines such collaborative efforts by peers. The collaborators act as the stewards of commonly held wealth and assets which could be anything ; monies, knowledge, equipment, reputations, social capital etc.The beauty of such networks is that development for one project can be mixed and remixed to suit a variety of other needs. Traditionally, such endeavors have been part of a gift-economy where peers do not seek tangible rewards for their contributions. However, for larger scale and mainstream economic model, gift economy is not a viable method for development. The question, then, is how do we keep track of contributions to inform fair rewards?That is where the Open Value Network model (OVN) comes in. An OVN is built around a core open source community, preserving its nature, and adds layers of governance, infrastructure and methodologies in order to make large scale, open innovation networks as predictable and accountable as traditional organizations, such as coops or limited liability corporations. In an OVN, contributions to a process, be it tangible items such as time and money or intangibles such as social capital, are recorded and whatever benefit is derived from this process is proportionally divided and distributed back to contributors. This makes open networks sustainable, by allowing the implementation of capturing and redistribution mechanisms. Networks have yet to gain public recognition, legitimacy and legality, but the jury is out already, the OVN model makes open networks fully capable socioeconomic agents.SENSORICA is the first instantiation of the OVN model. It originated in Montreal, in early 2011. The initial focus of the network was to develop open source scientific research equipment using commons-based peer production methodologies. Indeed, most of activities are coordinated from the SENSORICA Montreal lab, a physical location where local affiliates can meet and work together. However, the Network Resource Planning (NRP) tools that Sensoricans have developed lays the foundation of a strong decentralized community without geographical borders. It allows tracking of the flow of resources through the entire system, at both micro and macro levels. NRP is the mainstay of all SENSORICA projects, and enables SENSORICA to practically implement the ideologies of collaborative and open innovation in a transparent and equitable manner.The video bellow explains the idea in detail.The wellness of societies and communities also depend on the innovation of its peers. Over the past few decades, the care aspect of communities has also been commodified. Healthcare and Education, the basics of human needs, have slowly been removed from the sphere of communities and instead, been handed over to closed and elitist institutions, including companies for profit-maximization. The result is a disjointed system where even these basic necessities are the purvey of the well-off. Moreover, in health care the quest for new cures and treatments is a quest for profits, and resources are mainly deployed in research and development (R&D) that promises good returns on investments. The illnesses of a few are forgotten. Just like with technological innovation, we, as a society, need to free knowledge and break down barriers to participation. For that to happen, Open Science will play a big part, meeting the requirement of creating open source scientific equipment and research methodologies that enable peers to do R&D on issues most important to them.SENSORICA's position on Open ScienceSee more on Open Science on SENSORICA's website.Guy Rouleau, the director of McGill University’s Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) announced recently in the Science Magazine that his institute was going to steer towards Open Science. “We think that it is a way to accelerate discovery and the application of neuroscience.” (…) “There is a fair amount of patenting by people at the institute, but the outcomes have not been very useful” (...) “It comes down to what is the reason for our existence? It’s to accelerate science, not to make money.”SENSORICA has already taken concrete steps towards implementing this vision. One of the first projects undertaken by Sensoricans was the Mosquito, a force-transducer with ability to detect micron-scale movements, designed for applications in biomechanics at the cellular level. Today, SENSORICA has over 15 projects for open source scientific instruments in different stages of development, some of them being used in University labs (see the full list). However, the main potential lies in the ability of the community to build upon these and many other devices and repurpose them to fit needs in diverse fields.SENSORICA's Mosquito system - by photo Daniel BrastaviceanuOpen source scientific instruments cost only of a small fraction to produce and to maintain, compared to their proprietary equivalents. This reduces the costs of innovation and widens participation in research. Professor Joshua Pearce from Michigan Tech University, and contributor to the SENSORICA OVN mentions in one of his papers: A case study of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is presented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses representing orders of magnitude in-crease in value from conventional proprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing re-turn on public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.During its six years in development, SENSORICA has prototyped formal relations with Universities and medical centers, demonstrating how the crowd and the institutional academia can successfully interface, opening wide and filtering participation in medical research, allowing discovery to go towards what matters to people, not just to Wall Street. The Mosquito sensor has been developed in collaboration with the Montreal Heart Institute and Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, the Manipulators have been developed in partnership with McGill University. Numerous students have done their internship within the SENSORICA lab, not only practicing their technical skills, but also learning how to operate in a network-type, highly collaborative environment. See SENSORICA’s Interns webpage. --> Lower cost open source scientific instruments lower the barrier to entry to medical research.  --> Interfacing institutional academia with open networks frees research topics from the narrow profit motive and speeds up innovationIn early 2015, SENSORICA partnered with Breathing Games to produce an open source therapeutic device for kids suffering from cystic fibrosis. But this project is very different. As we are designing the hardware device, we are also thinking about how the data generated from its use during therapy sessions will be managed. It turns out that the blockchain technology can truly revolutionize how therapy and medical care are administered, and how the medical data is managed, and SENSORICA has already embarked in blockchain applications development. --> blockchain and other p2p technologies create the possibility of new health care servicesThe vision for SENSORICA is to demonstrate the economic viability and practical superiority of open innovation. Since innovation has been segregated from community for the better part of the last century, the possibilities of applications are endless. We are not claiming to have the solution all the problems that our health care system is facing, but our past experiences have allowed us to peer into a new realm of solutions, enabled by the new digital technology and the new socioeconomic processes it has made possible.There is a lot of criticism for commons-based peer processes pertaining to their ability to deliver large scale solutions, while being self-sustainable. In other words, the conclusions point to the persistent need of traditional forms of organizing innovation, production and distribution, in order to fuel these new processes: one needs to have a paid job to contribute to open source development. The flaw in these arguments is that they analyse these new practices within the traditional capitalist paradigm. Commons-based peer processes are part of a new socioeconomic paradigm, which prescribes its own underlying theory of value and its own capturing and redistribution mechanisms. Saying that open innovation is unsustainable is factually false, even within the capitalist regime. Arduino, for example, is a very successful commercial operation relying entirely on open source hardware and software technology. Most successful 3D printing and personal drone commercial operations also rely on open source, as well as operations that provide blockchain applications. All these new and disruptive technologies are dominated by these new types of ventures who know how to steward open networks. Something is going on here, for those who have eyes to see. And all these organizations are only hybrids, in the sense that their structure have capturing mechanisms that function in a market-driven economy, while relying on commons-based peer processes for innovation. SENSORICA has data that shows, perhaps for the first time, how capturing mechanisms that are fully compatible with the logic of the p2p economy can be gradually introduced within this transitory economy, to become dominant in a very near future.We do not have experience in pharmaceuticals. We cannot prescribe today a method through commons-based peer production to deliver a new drug, going through all the norms and regulations. The monetary costs associated with this type of ventures are huge, and if we transpose the challenge in an OVN setting it would require the deployment of an amount of resources and a complexity that we cannot sustain, at this point in time. But we do not see a hard barrier... As these systems scale, one day they will be capable of undertaking such challenges. Alternatively, we do have extensive experience with scientific instruments and less costly, and less regulated therapeutic devices. This is the path of least resistance for OVNs to infiltrate the care domain and gain strength. Joshua Pearce's conclusions show that once open source-based scientific instruments enter a market niche it totally disrupts it, putting traditional companies out of business, as they cannot sustain their operations at such low product prices. Operating at lower prices, the monetary rewards an organization gets for the product, doesn't mean that we are going towards poverty. The zero marginal cost tendency, driven by open innovation, only makes sense in the capitalist paradigm. These new organizations pull other benefits from non-market-based sources, which are forbidden to traditional for-profit enterprises. We need a different type of accounting in order to determine the wealth of network-type organizations, one that goes beyond monetary currency, because innovation, production and rewards are more and more driven and organized by new types of currencies, by new types of symbolic systems, by current-sees [a concept proposed by Arth Brook].Written by Abran Khalid and Tiberius Brastaviceanu---------------------------------------------------------The text has been remixed from a post for a book made by Tibi.

We campaign to establish February, 29th asEQUAL CARE DAYin order to draw attention to the lack of appreciation for care work in general and caring for children, sick, old or disabled people in our society. Do we really want people working with machines to be recognized and paid better than those working with people?To illustrate the unfair distribution of this work: 80% of care work is done by women, professionally and even more privately: 80%. That’s why the Equal Care Day will occur only every four years, as a reminder that, in Germany, men would take four years to equal the care work performed by women in a single year.Care work isn’t a private matter.It’s not an individual decision, but something that affects and calls for all of us. At best, we defer the problem by paying through outsourcing. The effects of this uneven distribution especially affect men, not only morally, because they give up most of their duties and responsibilities, but also personally. After retiring, a lot of men regret not having saved more time to spend with their children, their families This is especially significant given mens’ shorter life expectancy (5 years, on average) as compared to women – one of the reasons for that is that they’re less careful with their own bodies (unhealthy diet, belated reaction to/ignorance of symptoms, risky behavior, higher use of drugs, higher risk of suicide), maybe not individually, but statistically.P.S. PayGap and CareGap already exists in childrens's roomsThe imbalance starts out from children’s rooms, not just because the adult world conveys narrow role models – but also because children themselves experience the CareGap as well as the PayGap: In average, boys’ allowances are higher than girls’ and girls are expected to help with housework and look after younger siblings a lot more than boys. We pass on a mix of sexism, racism and classism to the next Generation in a very subtle way.
HELLENIC ASSOCIATION FOR MOOD DISORDERS "MAZI" (“together” in Greek), is a non-profit organization established at 2010 by the majority of people with personal experience (patients and relatives) with Mood Disorders, friends of these people and professional experts with a special interest to participate in the effort of the association. The aim of the association is to support, empower and inform people suffering from mood disorder, their families and friends. The main vehicle for achieving this goal was the creation and support self-help groups for people with Mood Disorder.In various foreign countries such groups (self-help or support groups) already count several years of experience and have proven their importance for effective self-management of Mood Disorders (in addition to any treatment). MAZI aspired to fill this gap in Greece. At this moment there are 3 groups in Athens and one in Thessaloniki. The ultimate goal is the creation and support of a nationwide network of regional annexes empowerment of people with mood disorder and mental health promotion.During the meet ups of MAZI’s self-help groups, the participants share their experiences, personal feelings, information and strategies that have been developed to deal with mood disorder and live a fulfilling life. These sessions are about peer-support through sharing personal experiences, knowledge, concerns, worries and strategies.Participants are people who have been diagnosed with mood disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, Bipolar Disorder I and II and cyclothymic disorder). The groups often include relatives and friends of people with mood disorder. These groups do not have a therapeutic clinical role and therefore do not replace or supersede any medical, psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment that the participants may receive.There are no expert lectures and no self-pity parties. These self-help groups are meet ups of optimism, hope and encouragement. The specific objectives of the programme are:to support and encourage members in regaining control and improving the quality of their lives and their relationships. to provide an environment of emotional support, which reduces isolation and alienation, moderates despair and increases optimism, personal responsibility and self-acceptance. to help members extract greater joy and satisfaction from life, in spite of difficulties, obstacles, frustrations and setbacks. to help members learn and practice new, more effective and satisfactory ways of relating to others. It is a collective and individual responsibility of each group member to make the discussion a safe place for sharing. We respect confidentiality, treating each other with respect, courtesy, understanding and compassion. Anyone wishing to share something has the opportunity to do so, with no participant monopolising the group’s time. The group allows each participant to speak without interruptions and side conversations. Everything said there, stays there, following the prime rule of confidentiality which must be respected and observed by all. This rule is only lifted when a member declares that it intends to do harm to himself/herself or to others.It is OK to share, but whoever doesn’t want to, is not obliged to do it. We are all equal, and no distinctions are permitted on the basis of gender, race or age. Everyone has the right to their own opinion and tries not to impose the accuracy or uniqueness of these views. We use the “I” language (or “I message”), we don’t teach, command or advise others. We only share our experiences, ie. “according to my own experience, it is very helpful to…” rather than “what you should do…”This is not a program based on the “12 step” principle (ie. Alcoholics Anonymous). MAZI holds that each person has the knowledge and ability to find his personal path to ‘cure'. Hence, the groups are not based on any particular theoretical approach, except the value of established self-help and peer-support in a safe and non-critical environment. From October 2014 until April 2016, MAZI participated as main partner in the program ''Citizens against depression". The Programme aimed to strengthen civil society and enhance the contribution of NGOs to social justice, democracy and sustainable development. This project was funded by the Greek NGO Programme “We are all Citizens” which is part of the EEA & Norway Grants for Greece.Our main problem is the lack of our place. And this prevents us to carry out many other goals we have in order to fill the ever increasing needs of greek society on mental health. It is known that the financial crisis in our country makes it even more difficult. We need all the assistance that could be given in every way. 
 My name is Jenny Gkiougki and I have a Bachelor degree in Marketing and an MBA in Business Administration. During my residence abroad I was working as a business consultant and marketer. After ten years, I decided to return to my Greece to contribute to the local community. I am currently working on a project which is called “Real Food Utopia” as a co-facilitator with a foreign research partner, dealing with the mapping of alternative food systems in the region of Thessaloniki.The workshops of the project are related to alternative economies, peri-urban gardening, refugees and food through a participatory procedure between people who belong to informal initiatives all around the city. This procedure also includes training in participatory video making and working on all its processes (ie. storyboards, editing) in order to create audiovisual material and share the technique with everyone who is interested in it.I am a member of the URGENCI International Network of Community Supported Agriculture, the European Movement for Food Sovereignty, the Mediterranean Network for Solidarity-based Local Partnerships and “Neighbourhoods in Action”. I have been working on this project for 5 years and I am currently cooperating with a team of another three more advocates to create a legal entity of this action. In the near future, we would like to expand our network through an open call all over Greece and reclaim our existing collaborations and good synergies abroad.My interests also fall within ecovillages and permaculture all over Greece. Especially for the last case, I would like to encourage Greek people to be more involved in the procedure of the Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market or get involved in complex food chains.With this project, we would like to address the needs of small-scale farmers who wish to obtain access to European food markets at fair prices, but also consumers of all ages who become more conscious about food production and consumption. I would like to engage in interactive campaigns and seminars that target informal collectivities who are interested in food sovereignty, but lack financial resources and technical support. Our community project will form a new hub that will host them and their projects.We are interested in creating a new agricultural production model in Greece, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency in the context of land and food management, considering limiting factors such as economic hardship. All in all, we pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living through an “umbrella” project which consists of several innovative schemes.The main scope of the project is to empower rural farmers and inspire rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, based on the principles of permaculture. We wish to enhance small-scale agriculture, in order to revive Greece’s rural areas and promote an economy that is based on social solidarity and alternative currencies.What we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:Exporting network of agricultural products in Northern Europe (especially citrus, olive oil and “ugly” fruits) that are produced by small-scale farmers to solidarity collectivities at fair prices. Promotion of food security and food sovereignty in Greece. Respond to the mainstream challenges by using our ingenuity and creativity for social –nonpersonal- benefits. Reduce food waste promoting “ugly” fruits and vegetables focusing on good quality. Boost local economies and offer technical support to Community Supported Agriculture schemes. Creation of an official Greek hub for non formal groups working on food sovereignty that lack financial support. Saving of Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensuring its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership. Increase awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns. Also, we are very interested in local pupils and students who are a significant target group.
The Migrants Social Centre is a multifunctional space of solidarity in practice towards immigrants and at the same time serves as an open social center and meeting point for various movements and political resistance groups.The Centre caters to the needs of immigrants, homeless, unemployed, low-income pensioners and locals in general, who have the opportunity to meet basic and social needs. This extends from food and clothing to socializing in the clubroom of the Centre. It is also open to local and foreign collectivities, such as theatrical groups or other alternative schemes that can’t afford much money to rent a place in order to operate. And is accessed by both Greeks and immigrants (especially children) who lack educational opportunities.It was established in 2004 on the initiative of Antiracist Initiative of Thessaloniki and since 2009 it is housed in a historic area of the city center. Beyond the Antiracist Initiative, its 3 floors currently house approximately 20 movements, labor, migration and social collectives, assemblies and other initiatives, like theatrical and cultural groups.Initiatives of the Migrants Social Centre also include voluntary actions of practical solidarity groups such as “Out of the Classroom” that offers free courses in Greeks and immigrants (Greek and foreign language lessons, additional teaching to Junior High School and High School students). It also runs:a Solidarity Kitchen that offers meal and companionship to hundreds of people every weekend. Room39 that gathers and distributes relief items and food to refugees and homeless. A Legal Support Group for refugees and immigrants and many other temporary or permanent activities. Other collectivities that reside independently in the Migrants Social Centre are Indigenous People of Biafra, the Network for Unemployed and Precarious Workers, the Network for Political and Social Rights, Ethical, Technological & Idealistic Association the Theatrical and Tango Group of Immigrants’ Place, and much more.We are reaching out to citizens and other local organizations through a dedicated website and our Facebook page, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to people in need. Additionally, we keep cooperating with collectivities all over the city and not only with these that are housed in the Migrants Social Centre, like the local social solidarity clinic.In the Solidarity Kitchen, people who currently offer their services come from those who initially asked to have access to lunch on weekends. Also, we would like to highlight the contribution of Room 39’s members, who deliver meals to homeless people all over the city center on bikes. It is the only initiative in Thessaloniki that serves food directly to the public spots where homeless people live every night.It is a completely self-organised place, depending exclusively on volunteers’ work and all of us who participate in it. Financially, the Social Centre is solely supported by donations of the participating groups and the profits of the clubroom.Today, the Migrants Social Centre faces many financial challenges, putting at risk its continuity and operations.Our Refugee Hostel was for years the only hosting structure for immigrants in Thessaloniki, offering free accommodation to 70 adults and children. When the Public Electricity Company cut the power in the hostel due to high debt, we reconnected the supply to our name. The existing debt will stop all activities and solidarity action housed and supported by the Centre. This includes the solidarity courses for locals and immigrants, the kitchen, the collection and distribution of relief items. Therefore, we address solidarity collectives in Greece and abroad, asking for contributions to repay this debt.
I have been a kindergarten teacher in public schools for 22 years. Looking back at my childhood, I was surrounded by my village’s scents, friendly voices and the care of the neighborhood. Having this background, I moved on to study pedagogics, eventually becoming a wife and mother of three children. Since then, my constant self-discovery voyage with pupils, parents, and teachers who never stop learning and reforming is still going on.The “Tree of Life’ is the outcome of my fulfilled dream in building an extraordinary school in nature. A place where learning is accomplished experientially, in harmony and interaction with the natural environment, aiming to lead children on a wonderful quest. The "Tree of Life” is a non-profit organization founded in June 2013. The idea was born from a group of people coming from different walks of life, who as citizens and as parents share similar concerns and dreams for the next generation. The world with values, morals, respect for fellow human beings and the environment, faith in the teamwork and creating. ‘Together we can change our world…’ is the motto of our association in an effort to stress the anthropocentric aspect of life.  Our vision is to train a group of people who will form the core of a community where teamwork is based on creativity, meritocracy and joy rather than apathy, ignorance, indifference, and irresponsibility. The world that dares, cares, dreams, contests, and helps, and is doing so by changing whatever it doesn’t like, and at any cost. The common denominator of this endeavor is the need for collaboration, solidarity, and offering without expecting personal benefits, the urge to defy fatigue and readiness to reduce one’s “valuable” personal time. Through our actions, we expect to restart - both financially as well as mentally. We believe that every problem has a solution and every day we keep working on this.Our team focuses on financial aid to minority groups, supporting vulnerable cases involving children and raising awareness of Municipalities and other Public Bodies. Moreover, we intend to encourage mobilization, action and contribution through promotion, education and entertainment and turn on the power of "We" despite the difficulties of our times. All actions of the association are dedicated to a specific purpose, with priority given to children and other vulnerable socio-economic groups. The unstable economic environment has eroded the values of our society, thereby the willingness of these groups to mobilize and diversify has waned. Some of our hitherto actions include support of orphanages and families facing life problems by collecting clothes, shoes, emergency supplies and food in cooperation with local churches. We have a project for interactive visual toy organization for children of 6-11 years and we created the Blood Bank "Tree of Life" in the Hippocrates Hospital of Thessaloniki. Several activities aim for personal development and increasing outreach, such as educational excursions, storytelling, drama therapy workshops, seminars with psychologists and renowned speakers, education and radio broadcasts. The ‘Tree of Life’ also features ‘Lifecycle’, a theatrical group composed of 35 volunteers, organizing theatrical performances in order to generate income for vulnerable social groups and communities. The beneficiaries of the ‘Tree of Life’ are:pupils who learn by their parents’ actions and who are identified by themselves and not by what they are doing.local communities getting inspired by the voluntary actions of the association.parents who get activated in order to interact with each other, contribute to their creativity and charity to people in need, irrespective of their personal hurdles. A dedicated website and a Facebook page include all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.
I would like to share how complicated schooling and university education is in Madagascar, and how people are going about it, trapped between history and modernity. This big Island to the right of  Africa hosts20 million people, the majority still living under  1 £ a day. They have a lot of opportunities which still need to be explored. And those opportunities are in the hand of the future generations who need some rejuvenation.  Malagasy parents used to tell stories and legends to give wisdom, advice and knowledge to their children. When there were some schools appearing they thought that a story is not enough to raise their own child. Wisdom came before knowledge for Malagasy people. As Malagasy are saying "Let your behavior be like a tree: if the roots are strong enough, leaves can shake as they want."  Parents decided to send children to school and encourage them to go further as long as they can support them. In fact having a son or daughter graduate from University is an honor for parents and children, it means that both are successful. In that time, to accept a job opportunity easily, leaving the familial cid and flying with their own wings is easier.Nowadays, child education is a must until the 6th grade, to be exact. Knowing how to count, writing one’s name or read, that's enough in some suburban places. Somewhere in the South of Madagascar kids have to travel 3 hours through village or dunes. Sometimes walking 15 km from school and going back and forth, sometimes students get a half day of school. There has never been a bus school or transport, and even if students get a student car they don't get reduction. It's happened that teachers don't get paid for three months, become lazy and don't teach classes. Sometime parents and someone in charge on school find a solution, telling parents to give some amount of money or telling his child to bring some rice for the canteen. In small villages school is far, college and high school is even farther, University is more in the province. It's happened also that parents are less educated and don't know how to guide the child, in fact the essential for the children is to manage their own life insurance. Graduating from University doesn't make sense anymore for young people. As a young Malagasy person I know where we have been, but I don't know where are going... After finishing your studies you need to line up behind millions of jobless for a job opportunity.  After investigation ; Many those young people struggle and move on the street working as a "taxi phone" mobile cheap call, bus driver, gold digger... any available job in general. Some get influenced by easy money called "bizna": it means selling anything, from a friend or relative, like cell phones, computers, tyres, cars. Those who have funds to run their business can invest into something short term or permanent like restaurants, jewelry, imports etc. Let’s talk about it: 67 % of Malagasy people are about 15 to 25 years young.  Statistically 15 % of graduates get an exact job for the position that they prepared for in University, 65% remain jobless and 10 % know someone high placed and get to work for an unsuitable job and that they don't have any idea what it is about or how to do; about the last 5% have something  planned for, and finally the 5% remaining help  parents at home. Many foreign companies like to employ people from Sri Lanka or Indonesia because they are more skilled and less corrupted... We have more and more foreigners who are coming here to get rich. It's also another gate for economy and illnesses from both sides. There are some good things in progress. Recently I met some people from Christian missionary called ADRA "Adventist Development and Relief Agency"  using techniques to improve farming for those who have land or what to farming it was only a campaign. NGOs like USAID who have been here since 32 years to help Malagasy people to realize goals of development, recover from natural disaster like cyclones, health care like malnutrition, sponsoring on project used to be only for educational like "youth and reproduction",  "Youth against HIV". But it's only in the capital or on a regional campaign for few times and not long enough to be remembered by people. They are trying to give free training, help and support for young people in suburban areas but ... sometime with no success . Youth Volunteers like Peacecorps almost every year whose giving free teaching, help and give some supplies like pen and copy book, chalkboard  etc.. if they have something to give. All those things are looking good for a while, but they have no impact on their lifetime. There is no precise political with systematization or screening. There is not enough community who cares especially for young Malagasy. Insecurity, infrastructure and corruption are principal factors which still exist since long time and drag in deep water the majority of those young people. When I was asking them to give their thoughts, they say: " We felt abandoned by the government, they only thinking about how to full they pockets. As we learned from school: "I" is going first and "YOU" is after, that’s how people in government are thinking. Our daily duty is to wake-up, go outside chilling with friends, and go back home at lunch time”.Finally, Malagasy people cannot lean on their own government, it doesn’t have enough budget to overcome this or: the budget is going somewhere else which is more important, like towards health. Private school is plenty even if some of them don't have the right character as a normal school: no playing ground, no gates... Parents like it because the teaching method is quite modern and up to date, teachers are quite professional.  Some of those private schools belong to someone on the Government. The good thing is that teachers in private schools are at least able to do their job smoothly and actually finish school programs. Malagasy people still believe that education is the best legacy. How do you find ways to make a living as a young generation which government does not care for ? Please go ahead, ask questions and add your comments :)The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
"Positive Voice" is an association for People living with HIV/AIDS, founded in Athens in 2009 with the purpose of defending the rights of PLHIV, addressing the spread of HIV/AID and reducing its social and economic impacts in Greece. The association strives to ensure better prevention and renovation practices, care services and social care for patients and social groups who are sensitive to HIV. We promote social acceptance, solidarity, and support of these groups, addressing violations of dignity and their human rights, especially for those living in conservative societies. Additionally, we share ideas and human stories, offer free non clinical HIV / HBV and HCV tests in a very discrete way in our premises in Athens and Thessaloniki, named Checkpoints - you can read more here-, run annual events and campaigns for public awareness all over Greece and on the occasion of World Days of HIV/AIDS, Athens Pride or days dedicated to health prevention. Our members’ main goal is to offer training, psychological and technical peer-to-peer support inside clinics, especially for patients who lack family support for whatever reasons. Moreover, we have programs for harm reduction to HIV-infected prisoners, transgender people, and drug users. Our “Red Umbrella” program is a non-scientific supportive/advisory center for sex workers, transgender people and all the vulnerable key affected population. "Positive Voice" participates in international and European networks for the support of HIV-vulnerable social groups. The association is an official partner with several international organizations and Institutes such as AIDS Action Europe, HIV Europe, IPPF, KETHEA-Ithaca, the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and much more. In collaboration with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) of America, we have coordinated the development open of the infrastructure for prevention, information and medical tests for HIV, Hepatitis B-C, and Syphilis.We are very proud of our devoted voluntary network which operates on prevention training, information sharing, precaution and empowerment of HIV-infected people and participating in training seminars in Greece and abroad. This volunteer network has been educated in order to support street work, such as the distribution of condoms to key affected and vulnerable populations in Thessaloniki. At the same time, a dedicated website and a Facebook page, Twitter account and Instagram account, communicate all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.#PositiveVoicegr serves students in public schools who have the opportunity to get informed and participate in training seminars about HIV/AIDS prevention. We also work with HIV-infected people who are involved in psychological support programs -in personal or team sessions- twice a week, conducted by psychologists on a voluntary basis, in order to establish a healthier functional framework.Our vision is to find an appropriate place to create a Centre beside the existing “Thess Check Point”, for health rapid non clinical tests (HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, C). This is where citizens will be able to get information about the proper sexual practice. The Centre will put an emphasis on sex workers, transgender people, and drug addicts. Moreover, it will provide psychological support for relatives and mates of the patients, to help eliminate the stigma and discrimination of HIV-infected people.  We wish to develop a patient-centric approach based on peer-to-peer education among HIV-infected people, in order to provide psychological and advisory support to their co-patients. This can take the form, for example, of reading books to patients who suffer from chronic illnesses, defective eyesight etc. According to our human resources network, we are seeking ways to support financially our volunteer specialists (psychologists, sociologists), who provide invaluable professional services to the members of our association. And we continue the actions of helping more HIV-infected people in order to find a job and keep being productive, sociable and creative. George-Alexander Tanaskidis-Lampousnakis and Amalia Manolopoulou, representatives of the Department of Northern Greece "Positive Voice" Office *Alexander Tanaskidis is the direct representative of the Department of Northern Greece working at the headquarters of "Positive Voice" in the city of Thessaloniki supporting a big amount of members on a daily basis.

What follows is a long story documenting some of my experiences working as a caregiver on the Calais camp during March - May 2016.The first thing that strikes you about the Calais camp is the smell. In the beginning you assume it comes from the camp itself. After prolonged exposure to it you realise it comes from the chemical plant next door. It pours a strange chemical tang over the surrounding area. I will never forget that smell. It masks the true nature of the camp.I use this image to emphasise the unsanitary conditions of the site, and how you become desensitised to them.Each morning at the l’Auberge des Migrants Warehouse between 40-200 volunteers arrive to help with the day’s tasks. It is one of 2 or 3 three aid organisations in the area serving the needs of the camp.The number varies depending on the day of the week or the time of year. The tasks at the warehouse vary in difficulty and duration. Some people may find themselves chopping firewood for a day, or sorting through clothing donations. Those that can only volunteer for a day or two will do these jobs that base them at the warehouse. Volunteers that are available for a week or more will join the clothing or food distribution team. This involves spending a lot of time on the camp working face-to-face with refugees.Volunteers available for a month or more find themselves joining the 'Aid Distribution' or 'Vulnerabilities' team.These teams work on the camp every day. Travelling from shelter to shelter to assess aid requirements and taking clothes and food to vulnerable people (children, elderly, injured). When i started at the Calais camp these teams didn’t exist. I helped to set up, test and structure the team program. Now, 5 months later the teams are indistinguishable from the basic structures that i helped to set up.Working days are long and filled with waiting. Long-term volunteers have to balance time considerations to get the most work done. Volunteers arrive early. UK volunteers have early Channel ferries to pack a full day in. Or the locals from Belgium and France are more balanced towards early starts. As a result the warehouse opens early with many arriving around 8am to start working.On the other end of the spectrum the refugees on the camp rarely rise before 11am. Many have been up for most of the night; making attempts to get into the port area, travelling to lorry parks nearby; etc. The camp itself comes to life at about 4pm with the most people around between 4pm and 10pm.This means days often start with a lot of waiting. They often extend further into the evenings for the long-term volunteers. 12hr+ days without proper breaks are par for the course, particularly for the volunteers working on the camp with the refugees.Those working in the Aid Distribution team have to work in intimate personal spaces. The role requires you to enter into the shelters and tents of refugees to communicate with them. Preferably, this requires a translator, but most communication is through non-verbal, gesture and eye-contact. Even with a total language barrier, the way the refugees welcome you into their personal space is heart warming. The experience is unlike anything I have experienced elsewhere. For many British volunteers this immediate intimacy from strangers can be strange and disorienting. It feels odd to accept food, drink and hospitality from people who have so little already. Yet, rejecting the offer also seems heartless. It is difficult to balance these conflicting emotions. I often struggle to balance my desire to be ‘efficient’ at the task, with being ‘friendly’ to the people I’m helping. I could spend a whole day working with only 10-15 people: Eating food with them; making notes about vulnerabilities; listening to the needs of their community and drinking sweet milk chai. Then I remember that there are thousands of people on the camp. If I spend the same amount of time with each group it would take years to finish the simple tasks.In these small, intimate moments people open up to you. Some share stories, opinions on the camp or photos from their phones. Some photos are of family and home. Some photos are graphic images of violence and bloodshed. You never know if these images are from their own experience, or if they are from external sources. Almost every refugee can connect to the internet and people share images amongst groups. You know it would be rude to ask for verification. You are frequently reminded not to push anyone to tell you about their life before, or their journey. You are not a therapist and reliving traumatic experiences can re-traumatise them.These moments also show you how angry people are. Refugees stop you in their shelters, or on the paths around the camp. Inter-community tensions seeps out through small cracks. The walls and fences of the Calais port don’t discriminate between nations. So neither does the camp. Afghanis rub up against Iranians, Indians, Sudanese and Syrians. Some communities are better established on the camp. Some manage their resources and people better than others. Some communities have established 'leaders' who act as a lynchpin for fellow countrymen. I met a young Indian refugee who was angry there was no Indian community leader. I explained to him he was the first refugee from India i had met on the camp. He was de facto the community leader for his nation.Race, religion and resource issues overlap in a fraught and challenging space. It is surprising that it doesn't descend into violence more often. The fact it doesn't is a testament to the work done by volunteers, and faith and community leaders on the camp.When it does break down like this it is scary and totally unexpected. You can never relax into to the role. Every day demands that you prepare to be surprised. You can be disarmed by a moment of pure joy and positivity from a happy young man. Around the next corner you could be challenged by an angry refugee, or a major medical injury.Sometimes the pressure comes from the armed police that surround the camp. At every entrance a bus full of armed police waits. They stop all vehicles going on to the camp. Sometimes they're friendly, sometimes officious, always confrontational. When there are problems on the camp or the nearby Motorway they respond with CS gas canisters. They fire them at will over the whole camp. Dispersing refugees into shelters. The canisters overheat when they let the gas out, this causes fires in the camp. Often the police target refugee communal areas like restaurants and shops. They try to use the gas to burn them down. I will never forget walking through the camp, under a thick fog of CS gas, my throat raw, shielding my watering eyes from the gas with a scarf.In the end you start to live like the refugees on the camp: day-to-day, expecting the unexpected, desperate to get away to the ‘real world’ but somehow unable to move on.You find yourself under the same strain as the refugees. You get emotionally attached to their quest. You want them to succeed at making it across the Channel. But when they leave the camp to try you feel a gut-wrenching fear for them. You’ve heard too many bad stories – about the armed police; about the fascist skinheads that patrol around the ferry ports; and refrigerated lorries. Whilst I was there I met two people I later found out fell under the wheels of a moving lorry, or became trapped in airless lorry containers; suffocating to death.Sometimes you hear someone you work alongside for months has made it across to the UK. You feel overwhelmingly happy for them. Then you feel sad and angry that you don’t get to see them anymore. Then you feel guilty for being selfish.In the end there is either hope, or hopelessness; Chance or no Chance. Both suffocate you and the refugees. It clouds all your conversations and interactions.Mentally, the camp comes back with you into the volunteer spaces. Most volunteers are young people between the ages of 18 and 25. They are mostly students and temporary/seasonal workers. A lot of long-term volunteers work in the UK music festival community. Mental health for the volunteers is a concern. Everyone lives on a knife-edge. Most volunteers self-finance their time working in Calais. They live frugally, stretching their money out. This means they end up living on top of each other. The warehouse team has a caravan park attached to the building. Volunteers with no money can stay there. Living up to 6 people in a caravan, with limited access to hot water and personal space. Volunteers who live in this enclave have a different experience to those who stay in private accommodation or hostels.Everyone experiences some form of trauma. Most experience exhaustion. Often trauma comes from being in scary situations that you aren't trained to deal with. Occasionally volunteer social workers, therapists and psychologists stop by the volunteer camps. They offer their services for free. As always, the people who need it the most are most likely to not take advantage of these services.I met a few long term volunteers who had become caregivers 24/7. They would work long hours on the camp or managing the warehouse. In the evening they would sit listening to the emotional and personal problems of volunteers. They might operate on only 5-6 hours sleep per night and then do another 18hr day of work. Every day. Every week.Days off from the work of the warehouse and camp are encouraged, and even scheduled. But they are ignored, rescheduled, or simply don't happen. People feel responsible for the people on the camp. They can't switch off.The management team at the warehouse made some great improvements even in the short time I was there. More training for long term volunteers on conflict resolution and dealing with difficult people. More training on how to self care and look after each other. The warehouse caravan park was designated an alcohol-free zone. Resident meeting were set back up. A weekly 'safe space' for free and open personal discussion was created in the warehouse. Weekly film screenings were restarted.Over all this positive improvement still hangs the uncertainty of the future. Volunteer numbers have decreased. Aid donations have slowed. Some organisations struggle to fundraise the money needed to provide services on the camp - for the first time since last year refugees on the camp report hunger and malnutrition.In the face of this adversity volunteers get up every day and go onto the camp to help. They meet people new and old, hear new stories, discover new problems and show a friendly face to those in need. Not because it's their job, but because they feel a duty to help. A 16yr old Afghani boy i worked with every day for 2 weeks asked me a question one night: “Why is the world so faithless?”I didn't know how to respond at first. What did he mean? Was he asking about religion? I couldn't answer. So i thought for 10 minutesFinally, i responded:"I don't think it is. The world is full for people who are scared. This fear drives their actions. But there are always others who respond to fear with love. This love is faith." He gave me a look that said 'strange European man, you know nothing of the world!'Yet i stand by my answer. Every day hundreds of volunteers from all over Europe travel onto the Calais camp to show this love. They come with gifts and open hearts. They leave exhausted, frustrated and heartbroken. And they come back the next day, and the next. That has to be something positive. Do you have similar experiences working with refugees in other parts of Europe?Do you have any useful experience that might help the volunteers at the camp?Do you have any ideas for how the Calais refugee situation could be re-structured after the evictions?Are there any other parts of my experience that you would like to learn more about? The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016
It’s mostly about changing the arrogant and irrealistic medical system, which operates outside of the communities and is based on universal, cookie-cutter solutions.  We’ve started the process in 2006 - our organisation,GNU Solidario, started as an educational initiative. The initial goal was to create free software with education and academic programs embedded into it, which would be accessible to remote areas in Latin America for example (I have worked there for many years).  The longer I worked in some of the poorer countries, the better I understood that the pressing need is actually more basic - kids need good nutrition before they can go to school. And the ever present reductionist Model of Disease has to be changed into a holistic System of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. There are various reasons why countries fail at providing the best care possible: too much privatization, too much technology supplanting good, basic policies. Doctors being more drug sellers than anything else. Omnipresent micro-specialization, which pushes medicine even more towards seeing a person as particular organs instead of a whole, complex, bio-psicho-social-spiritual being.  And so we shifted towards the creation of the System of Health, a system that would integrate care providers, institutions, individuals. A system rooted in the idea of Social and Integrative Medicine, which promotes education, good nutrition, family affection, physical exercise, and sanitary housing conditions, along with the state of the art innovations in the areas of precision medicine, (epi)genetics, bioinformatics, as the best and most sustainable public policies one can make. With this concept in mind,  GNU Health (any pronunciation is OK, but I like the concept of "new") was born in 2008. A little bit later, GNU took its recent shape of The Free Health and Hospital Information System, which is available in a form of wiki - dynamic as the health (care) itself and consistently updated. It can be installed and used by hospitals, governments, institutions, under a free license. As health and care are parts of a complex, multi-etiological and anthropological issues, the system we’ve created allows management and analysis of a huge amount of data and aspects:  Individual and community management: demographics, domiciliary units, families, operational areas and sectors, ... Patient management: Socioeconomics, lifestyle, encounters / evaluations, hospitalizations, lab reports, genetics, clinical history, ... Health center management: Finances, stock, pharmacy , laboratory, Dx imaging, beds, operating rooms, appointments, supply chain management, human resources, … Information management: Reporting, Demographics and Epidemiology  Access to this information and ability to interpret and understand it is a precondition to an effective (health) care system, and it has to complement the work of nurses, teachers, mothers and fathers, social workers and doctors… Our role is to provide these institutions with a system capable of handling and processing huge amounts of data, and based on these findings - craft optimized prevention and deploy effective teams to tackle challenges. Our maps, for example, can show in real time spots in which the outbreaks of dengue happens, allowing for fast reaction. But it does much more than that - it shows the relations between health and family violence and teenage pregnancy. It underlines social determinants. It grasps the relations between economy and well-being.  Later on, we have added more functionalities, for example, Universal Patient’s ID that supports centralisation of information about a person - this way you’re not a new patient to each one of your doctors, but your story is accessible to health professionals.The ID does not allow the duplication of either individuals or patient medical history at the health center. On the upcoming features, the GNU Health Federation, will allow to aggregate information coming from multiple contexts, and  GNU Health is, in fact, a philosophy. It is about multidisciplinary communities with various tasks that contribute to more effective, more empathetic, more patient and health-oriented care. It’s about a new mindset and a new attitude of health professionals, whose work cannot be efficient without a human approach to the patients and a deep understanding of their condition. Nutrition, exercise, prevention, information, empathy, affection, family, hygiene, education, technology, housing conditions - these and many more aspects have to be taken care of and supplement each other.  The system is being used in various places. In Argentina and Laos, it has been implemented by neurological and trauma rehabilitation and centers a few years ago. It is being installed in Argentina in districts to manage primary health centers. The Ministry of Health of Morelos, Mexico for the province. The biggest hospital in Laos, a reference in tropical diseases, runs on it as well. The government of Jamaica started a couple of years ago the implementation project for managing the Public Health system of the island. These institutions and countries are independent now from proprietary solutions, which should be the integral principle in health care. Their work and experience help to improve the community. It’s a lot of solidarity, equity and community work as a result. And they’re free from external vendors, institutions, licenses, they can modify the modules and create new ones - for example, the module dealing with Injury Surveillance System was built in response to the needs in Jamaica.  Money helps us move faster, but it’s the people who make us achieve really remarkable things. We understand how medicine can be improved, changed, how it needs to be adjusted to the cultural setting, and based on individual needs, precisely addressed. 
I met Sigried some years ago when I was working on a Parc project in Brussels and we had long discussions about the way she looks at the balance between public and private space. Between then and now she experimented around public – private space in Istambul, the Netherlands, Brussels and chose to practice her philosophy with her boyfriend, a product designer by living small (We Live Small is an on-going experiment developing tools to make living in small space possible.)When we meet again she comes back from a week working in her apartment and starts explaining why they chose to live small. For her living in a condensed space within the city is ideal if you design it well. In Belgium people have the reflex to buy fast, and you feel a societal pressure around it. Because buying in the city become impossible, people find big houses farther away from the city. But big houses means a lot of possessions, and it means working harder in desk jobs in the city, which means again more stress. So the logical decision to stop this infernal spiral for them was to choose to live small, really small, and use the exterior as complementary.The secret of living decently in the city is to manage space and time differently, but she is aware that it becomes more difficult. Public space isn’t anymore a space for everybody, but a space for nobody. A cleaned-out space that only looks pretty. Because our fascination for more sterile environments we lost the skills to interact with each other. Who needs to interact with your neighbour if you have all the space you need inside your private home. Living small could bring back the necessity of interaction and borrowing stuff from your neighbours, helping create a much-needed social fabric to your neighbourhood.When she works for the semi-public private space project Huis VDH she finds the same logic. Creating common spaces that gives the feeling of a home, but are able to invite people over to use it in certain ways. Why have a big living room with kitchen for social events that you organize four times a year at home when you could share such space with other people. Some things can be privatized but not everything. In the same line of thought she sees empty spaces above shops or pubs and restaurants as an opportunity to create common spaces for people living small. You could think: why not set bigger apartments above those places? That could immediately make it difficult for the bar or restaurant holder to continue his night live activities, and also this plays an important role in the city.‘But how could it directly be linked with care?’, i asked her. She takes the example of elderly care, also discussed in the interview with Ginette where people even if they live in big houses don’t have the time anymore to care for their elderly and put them into homes, from own experience we conclude that the home isn’t the best designed space to give good care. Making effort to create a nice environment for the elder people could help them feel well longer. We know from studies that interaction is a key in stopping elderly dementia. So having public spaces designed around giving care and sharing part of your lives with unknown people could be a major incentive for our future problems with ageing population.When living in Istanbul it occurred to her that people interacted much more easily with each other in the street, even complete strangers could discuss with each other when waiting for the bus. She doesn’t know exactly why it occurred much more often in Istambul then in Brussels but she had the feeling the way we use time was part of the solution. Living small gives you much more time to just sit around, be outside and make you car independent. Only this simple part, of not having a car makes you much more able to interact with the people you see. But don’t be alarmed; this discussion didn’t became a ‘everything was better in the past’ discussion.Cascoland was another project where she worked around public and private space. One of the tasks she had was to implement a sharing community inside a mixed neighbourhood. Like in Germany or Suisse they printed out little signs of objects anybody could put on their door to show they can lent this out. What was interesting was the conclusion: when explaining the concept to people with only Dutch roots they answered almost all the time: but I have nothing to share. For them it was a difficult step to share something of their belongings with their neighbours. When explaining the concept to people with Arab roots for example they didn’t have a problem with sharing and where found of the idea, but had a problem with the fact the stickers would become an opportunity for other people to come inside. Inside their community they already had all the needed interaction and didn’t want something external extra. A compromise could be the organization Tournevie that puts in disposal several tools for the community. A semi-private public space, as we understand it.We conclude on the fact that the creation of digital tools will not alone be the solution, what we need are well thought of spaces that give people the possibility to live at a descent standard without needing to fall in the spiral of a purely private ownership.Sigried will be participating to the Open&Change Workshop in Brussels and will be working on the scenography of the place to give it a welcoming space to be creative about care solutions.  
In the 1980s, my mother has been working as an educator in the prison of my hometown, Trikala. As a result, I have been countless times inside the prison premises, and I am accustomed to this environment since the age of 10. Coming from this background, with my family aware of the power of education and creative action for those who are serving in a prison, I always knew I would end up doing something within this field.Our societies usually perceive inmates as people that deserve a second chance. Instead, I believe that inmates need to be convinced to give to society a second chance, and trust it again. Having a clear understanding of the challenges, and having a background in visual arts, I wanted to make museums understand that they have a social role, complementary to the preservation of cultural heritage. They ought to get out of their box and get in closer contact with the society. The National Museum of Contemporary Art already has already been working with communities inside the prison system. In April 2015, as part of my thesis on designing a museum outreach program that is open to vulnerable social groups, I started the project in the prison of Trikala. Since inmates were not allowed to visit museums, we started designing our own, inside the prison. We collected all art pieces from the last 8 years -ranging from photography, sculpting, pottering and audio to texts and design. And we did standard museum work, such as documentation or writing captions for each piece.The name “MESA” (= “inside” in Greek) came through elections, which involved campaign speeches and polls. It was a very empowering process, because, for most of the people, this was the first time they voted. Once the name was decided, we offered information and guidance about things like logo design. But the logo was designed one night by the inmates themselves inside the prison wing. As a second step, we thought it would be nice to open the museum to other structures, acting as curators. We approached other prisons and some of the artwork was sent to the National Museum of Modern Arts in Athens, the whole process designed and executed by the team. This was the first opening of the National Museum of Modern Arts in Athens, and I was very proud that this large museum was open to the work of a young curator and that of a very stigmatized social group. The project team comprised of 12 artists and architects, but there were about 40 contributors in total (visual artists, volunteers, museum staff, etc). Including the inmates at the Centre of Therapy for Addicts, this number was raised to 100. In the prison school, we realize aspects like the notion of collaboration and democracy, through art. In total, we work with four prison structures and a Centre of Therapy for Addicts (KETHEA), which receives addict inmates, with the prospect of detoxification. Eighty percent of our community is younger than 35 years old. Another fifteen percent is up to 50, and five percent up to 70 years of age. This has mainly to do with the fact that we work with prison schools. Ninety-five percent of the inmates we are working with are immigrants, but we are also working with the Centre of Therapy for Addicts (KETHEA) which hosts mainly Greeks.We collaborate with the Ministries of Justice and Education, the Centre of Therapy for Addicts (KETHEA), the National Museum of Modern Arts and the Municipality of Korydallos, the city hosting Greece’s largest prison. The schools are operating under the auspices of the prison system of Greece, and there are always certain procedures to be followed. The Ministry of Justice needs to offer permission to enter the prison premises.We didn’t face many institutional problems, because as the project gets established, the resistance drops. There are, of course, problems. For example, most times I find myself at the center of everything, having to manage from finances to human resources. However, such operations involve activities that cannot be handled by one person. This is why we are now talking about creating an operational team, that will be able to take decisions and execute the project. The members are already identified and we are now meeting to discuss future plans.  MESA is currently an informal team, but we are now in talks about the creation of a legal entity, so we can manage funds and scale our projects. Meanwhile, Greek authorities have declared that they would give priority to education over security - something that is a very strong commitment. We are waiting for replies from the Ministries, in order to see whether we can be part of any public programs.We don’t consider MESA as a lesson, but as a collaborative creative office. Everything is decided in the circle - my opinion doesn’t count more than theirs. We always try to have our own rules, but we also know how we have to behave according to the rules of a confined prison environment. If some of them look dumb, then we know we need to try change them slowly. This doesn’t mean that we compromise our action in order to avoid conflict with the authorities, but it is a relationship of trust that has to be built very carefully. For this reason, we are also offering meticulous training to our team. The authorities are very open, but there is still lots to be done. I would like, for example, to be able to get the team out of the prison, in order to join in the exhibition. It was very difficult for me at the opening of the exhibition at the National Museum of Contemporary Art, since the team was not allowed to participate. My team was inside the prison, and I was there, in a different environment, and had to talk on their behalf.Through the project, the team is able to build several life skills. Maybe the most important one is leadership since everybody is responsible for something and the team is co-managed collectively. For inmates, the project cultivates the sense of collaboration and taking up responsibility. These might not be skills per se, but are important for those who are inside the prison. Another important aspect of working together is the ability to exercise crisis management, something that is important to them, but also to me. It is important that everyone understands how to bring the result to the team. And then, there is a set of skills related to the arts and other social issues.Working inside the prison is not an easy task. You need to always maintain a distance. Not between humans, but you need to understand your limits and protect yourself emotionally. One way of achieving this is not to talk about or listen to personal issues. Surely, this becomes increasingly difficult over time. You need to have respect and trust, and everything needs to be clear to everyone from the very beginning. To be able to set the goals transparently, and not function, nor to be considered as a “teacher” but as a collaborator. As a principle, we never ask, and never want to know, about what type of crimes have resulted in somebody ending up in prison.The biggest challenge is, maybe, how to mobilize the society. The best way is to do this slowly and gradually, with actions like this at the National Museum of Contemporary Arts, that attract publicity. We have tried to come out with quality art, backed up by solid artistic work and curation, so the initiative doesn’t receive a “thumbs up” just out of compassion, but because of the integrity of the results. Our aim was to communicate with the society equally and to be proud of it.
Since summer 2009, 30 families started living together in the first “official” co-housing in a periferic neighborhood in Milan, and probably of whole Italy. To my knowledge, the phenomenon has been often recorded by the Media (radio, tv, magazines and newspapers) and Polytechnic of Milan (Ph.D. and Master dissertations) as a first and original case. For some months and years, people liked to come and visit, check, make interviews about an experience that, in those years, sounded strongly innovative and now is consolidated. Some other co-living “residences” (but not many) of this kind have been promoted and started in the north of Italy and not only in Milan.What made this so new? Italy has a long story of small communities, both in the countryside (above all in the agricultural areas) and in urban areas. And we were about 70 people who didn't know each other before, who didn't share any identity or common belonging and who decided that co-housing could be a very good way to live. We have a shared living with semi professional kitchen, a small garden in the center of the building, shared laundry, bike space and hobbies area, and a terrace with swimming pool.It took almost two years (2007-2009) of co-creation and creating bonds between the members. Meanwhile, we've projected (thanks also to facilitators' support) some of the physical aspects of the building which allowed “personalization” by the community and facilitated the envisioning of a “way of living”. We agreed on some basic rules, attitudes, priorities and so on. Co-housing is about these two elements: the physical (spaces, objects, homes and shared areas) and relationships.Where are we about 7 years later?100 meetings +countless B-Day parties and shared lunches and dinners, bbqs4 kids +3 cats +the building is fixedrules of living have been adjusted through the real life experiencegroup email and WhatsApp group still alive and working properly (communication is deep and useful to keep connection and support)micro-welfare and mutual support include a lot of different situations (child care / homework/ vacations, home trouble fixing, information, shopping for the neighbor, shared purchases, savings, medical support, emergency support, skills sharing…)still volunteering in groups (garden caring, swimming pool fixing, legal affairs, food purchase)few people moved away but rented the house (just in case they come back)an association created to manage share expenses and service and to deal with town council and other local associationssharing knowledge and experiences (cooking course, dancing school, movies calendar, book presentations, pics competition/games, summer kids caring..)opening up to local events, well known in the neighborhood, networking with local associationsMany aspects should be analyzed for a precise assessment, some are probably specific to this very situation, some can be generalized. Of course only general considerations should be done, a detailed story would be more interesting as we have passed through several phases which coincided with the local and historical events (for example, the economic crises affected some of the member families; the city of Milan has been evolving; the arrival of new members - children; the Expo 2015 in Milan hosted nearby us…). But that would be very long.What I'd like to focus on instead is the startup, the real “lifestyle storming”, the community forming, the association phase, the community's opening up to the local area, the maturation phase, and the What’s Next?...I can’t say everything we've done was perfect but surely many lessons have been taken.  The “light community” has grown and changed adapted. At the beginning, we met very often to decide on things. We've probably put too  much relevance in fulfilling the physical needs, while we should have been looking for ways in which we can balance different speeds for those who  wanted to live this experience and adjust the levels of engagement… The preparation phase (2007-2009)  could not “prepare us” for the real thing.The big point is the continuous discussion among people (meeting, email, “working” groups) which is the backbone of this lifestyle, but also takes time and energy. We did probably too much of it at the beginning.Many difficulties have been fought together as we've been creating a big space, with many problems to be fixed (electricity, legal, walls, gardens, technological infrastructure..). The social project was on top of that. None of us was particularly aware of good planning.The kids have been a strong “glue” among the family with kids and others, who became kind of uncles, grandpas or grandmas. And a topic of discussion for the other ones.We had to come by with a legal framework to a situation unknown by Italian law (we had to govern it in the traditional way). The paid professional legal “administrator” has changed three times… It is hard for them to deal with a real counterpart with proposals and ideas for innovation.The usage of shared spaces, or of the mailing list, have changed through the time as we understood our needs in by practice.The opening up phase is probably one of the most interesting, as we tried to have our living room used by visitors. We have also created an association to manage the shared expenses (like a food purchase group, eventually a car), but also to prepare a project for the small park in front of home together with other associations.This was exactly the kind of situation that sociological literature likes to call a “gated community” . bu we never felt like that.  we started as a non-group, we have become a light community with different sensibilities and priorities, we've engaged with the neighborhood in several ways, we took part in local decision making, social action, and so on…It is still difficult to take care of a community when everybody has its own life and duties, and probably some external help and supervision would have helped in moderating tension, in identifying new solutions... Goodwill is never enough.We'd also gladly make use of a practical tool, perhaps a platform, to share materials, ideas, needs, etc. And being part of a bigger network to compare notes, support each other, share more, and maybe be connected with the town council infrastructure (cars, electricity, water, events, …)Anyhow, both visitor and inhabitants of the place are still surprised by the aesthetic, the connection, the quality of living which is hugely superior to any normal flat experience in a city (and even in countryside) they experience here. And we are frequently asked if any apartment is on sale or for rent.
The Orange House in the heart of Athens is changing the negative image about refugees through the cultivation of social skills.I am involved in refugee care as a volunteer since years because several of my friends are refugees. My partner, Hassan, comes from Syria and also had to cross the Aegean Sea. Last year, when I saw the gaps in the official structures for refugee  relief, I decided to create the Orange House. Many non-Greek volunteers offered to give money if I decided to build something. At first, we only thought of one room, because we didn’t have a lot of cash. But then, we found this house that was not used for several months. In fact, it was an old electronics and computer shop. Slowly, I started asking for help and people got involved with all things related to opening a space that would offer human shelter. This was the beginning of the Orange House, which opened in May 2016.The house has three floors, the upper one reserved for resident refugees who live inside it. They cook, clean and take care of the space by themselves. We rarely enter their space, unless some maintenance work is necessary. On the ground floor, there is a common space for everyone, which hosts several classes and sessions: from yoga to music, salsa dancing, and movie screenings. We use the half-basement, as a classroom for language classes, including Greek, English, Spanish, French and German on different levels. We also have a room in which we just meet to talk with each other and other spaces for storing clothes, glasses, food, educational material, bathing towels, etc. There is a kitchen and bathroom for people to walk in, a courtyard and a simple roof garden to grow vegetables in self-made contained made of old cargo palettes. The Orange House hosts a specialized 2-hour LGBT program for refugees every Monday, also visited by a guy from an Athens checkpoint to meet and offer help to the community. Our house is open for visits by NGOs, artists, gardeners and everyone who wishes to offer creative inputs, such as salsa, music classes, or just brainstorm on what we can do better. It is hard to say how many people visit the common space. Some people come for a specific activity like a lesson in German or French. Some other women bring their kids for all day long. Volunteers can also attend classes and other activities, which are offered totally free. However, we are planning to be able to make some items to sell, such as cooked food or jewelry made by some of the residents. Our idea for the future of the house is that the refugees in collaboration with the wider community will be able to generate their own money through the skills they have and develop. For example, we have some women with a talent for cooking, hairdressing, and Arabic calligraphy. The idea is that one day all this will evolve to a social enterprise, where residents in the Orange House will be their own boss.The operations of the house are managed by the community. For example, an Iranian woman is teaching someone else to do jewelry. Same goes with all housekeeping, like cooking and cleaning. We now want to register as a legal entity, in order to be able to manage funds. At the moment, I am renting the house under my name, paying 1000 euro for a monthly rent, and another 1000 for utility bills. The volunteers of the Orange House usually bring some cash and then we ask it they can change that lamp, or cover some other cost. We always have one volunteer sleeping inside the house, and we have a schedule of who is coming and for what reason. There are no public authorities or institutions involved in the project. We are just like that. Mohammed, one of the board members, works as a doctor for Doctors of the World and brings useful information about persons that need shelter. Some other NGOs also visit us to see in there are any needs. People usually appreciate what we do and the way we do it. When I tell them “look at me, I am Greek-French and I look like this”. Or when they see me together with my Syrian partner. I am Christian and he is Muslim, and some people think that this is something strange. But we know how to laugh about it, and tell them that these refugees are not terrorists or criminals, but humans like everyone else.When we first entered the house in May 2016, the place was so dirty and so many things were in need of repair. I knew since the beginning that it will be a lot of work, that I will need to work two weeks full time to get everything going. But this was not true at all because it takes much more time than I initially thought. Together we are taking very good care of our space. No alcohol, smoking or drugs are allowed in the Orange House. We check who is coming in and the neighborhood feels reassured. When people see refugees doing a yoga or salsa class, they have a different image of them. Instead of seeing the of misery, like on the Lesbos island or other camps shown on TV, we show that we grow happiness and care for the community. When we started, we noticed that most people don't know how to speak a language other than theirs. This is why we called the place “Orange House” because the word “orange” sounds similarly in Greek and Arabic. We also painted the house in orange color, so people coming for the first time can distinguish it easily. At the beginning, the biggest problem was bureaucracy. I didn’t know whom to address to get information on how to set up an organization. Someone suggested a lawyer, but I am still waiting for the paperwork since two months. We didn’t face any conflicts with the legal system because we are very careful of what we do inside the house. We brought engineers, social workers, and another expert to advise us and ensure that what we do is not something illegal.When we were almost done with all the work, I posted a poster in Greek, explaining to neighbors that what they see is the preparation of a house and school for refugees. We made a house-warming party, and we invited everyone to join, see for themselves and ask questions. This is a process of building trust. At the end of the day, there was only one neighbor that came to ask. Most people simply don’t care, otherwise, we could have more reaction. The house currently hosts 15 residents. We can only accept up to 20 persons because we only have 3 bathrooms, which is the major limitation. We explain to everyone that they must contribute to housekeeping, participate in the training programs and that it is important that we share everything. We cannot be with someone that wants to be alone in the bedroom, for example. It is not possible for us. There are about 50 people that visit the Orange House to receive some sort of service. For example, a 16-year-old who is very lonely and comes just to speak with others. Many of our visitors are staying in squats, camps of other shelters where conditions are not very good, but they come to the house because they like the atmosphere. When a visitor comes we offer tea, we talk and listen, but also sing and dance. It is really like a house, not like a social service type of place. Residency is only open to women and children, but male visitors are also welcome to join in the activities. Most of the male refugees arrived earlier, so the majority of the people arriving now in Greece are women and children. Quite often, we have women that have suffered some sort of abuse. We have listened to some very tough stories. Most of the volunteers are refugees themselves, or people coming from abroad and then going back home. Many people think volunteers need only shelter and food. But the reality asks for the development of real skills, to help them integrate into the society, but also have some fun. It is hard to find people that are not skilled to refugee care, but they have specific skills. What we need to have is a salsa or a hip hop teacher, or somebody that can help with the roof garden. For example, one of my friends is an electrician and is coming to do maintenance work in the building, for free.Anyone entering the house as a resident has to commit to attending 5 classes per week. Therefore, there is at least one activity taking place in some of the spaces every day. Sometimes, we organize outdoor activities, like hiking excursions. Refugees that benefit from the training programs at the Orange House are progressing their social skills very fast in. When a mother with a 17-year-old son arrived in May they spoke Farsi. They are now speaking fluent English. This is because everybody is connected through some sort of social action. The transformations we observe, offer some very important lessons. One of them is about the importance of patience, even when you are passionate about something. Starting a community of care is like planting a tree, and needs time to develop. There are times that you see things going wrong and always question what doesn’t work. But, actually, it is important to not give up and say that you have to try again. That you will tease many people, but at the end, it will work out. Over time, I am learning how to be more grateful for every progress that is happening inside the house. Any positive impact is important.
“A Resolution” points to the sparks that are creating a new light in the growing darkness: the revolutionary wave that spread from Tunis to New York; the Kurdish freedom struggle and the war against ISIS in Rojava; the riots and blockades sparked by the killings of Mike Brown and Eric Garner; and the retooling and remaking of life with “civilization starter kits” and “removing the dust” from indigenous knowledges and practices. “We, the people who work every day, who think we ‘don’t have time’ - we are the only ones who can do this,” said a Woodbine co-founder. “No one’s going to do this for us—no politician, no technological innovation, no international agreement. If we want a different future, we are going to have to make it, from where we are and in every place.”  The Woodbine Health Autonomy Resource Center is in Ridgewood, Queens. It is part of Woodbine, a hub for building autonomy in the wake of a dying civilization.Our goal is to examine what health autonomy would look like and how to begin to build it for ourselves here in New York city. We are beginning by providing ways to interact with neighbors, to think of health and care as a communal process, and becoming a point of aggregation where people can come together and share resources. We currently facilitate health related skill shares, create concrete ways to navigate the overwhelming health infrastructure that exists while lessening our dependence on it, in order to build an autonomous health community.We are beginning to experiment with providing care outside of the realm of state control. This practice may involve working outside the structure of licenses, certifications and insurance. Our intention is always to heal, and so we are finding ways to do this that protects providers and patients.Within Woodbine, the struggle for autonomy has been broken down into categories of the most urgent material necessity, meant to focus our attention on tangible goals toward building power within our community. Health autonomy is a crucial part of this. The health resource center is run by a mix of health professionals and those with informal training in various health practices. We want to re-create a sense of agency over health through a focus on the dissemination of usable, teachable skills. We are working with peers who practice herbal medicine, massage, feldenkrais, acupuncture, meditation, yoga and other forms of so called “alternative” medicine. We are creating our own definition of wellness, one that is congruent with the realities of our time. There is also a large focus on prevention of illness, of re-fostering the idea of a healthy life, not merely the absence of disease. This is how we begin the necessary process of removing our physical and mental health from systems that would damage them further, to reclaim control over health and use it to increase our collective autonomy.We do not reject modern methods of medicine, but recognize the need to detach its knowledge from the oppressive institutions that guard it. We are attempting to change our orientation to institutions of western medicine to one of use over dependence; a manipulation of the systems that surround us. While there are significant problems with the city’s public health infrastructure, they do provide much of the emergency and chronic care here. We realize that there needs to be support for people needing to navigate these without the fear of accruing a huge amount debt, alongside the emphasis of practices that will ultimately lessen dependence on them. The spaces dedicated to holistic medicine or alternative care are largely inaccessible to large portions of the population because they exist for those who can afford them. For these reasons, our center is meant to involve community members, help us understand the care-related skills we already have, and be an informational resource for accessing all types of health modalities. We have public open times for the community, staffed by one of our members, to assist in that process.Our skills workshops so far have included basic first aid, wound care, acupressure and intro to traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and an intro to medicinal plants. Coming up we will have workshops on navigating existing healthcare systems, nutrition, addiction and ongoing fitness skillshares. Our goal is that participants can use the resource library to learn about things relevant to their own health, potentially explore different modalities, and either receive aid in navigating the health systems in place or find treatment within the space itself.As we gain ground in the journey towards health autonomy, we see just how disempowered we have become when it comes to being able to give and receive the kind of care necessary. We have to fight that disconnection and build the infrastructure in order to give ourselves the space to envision a new existence. We look forward to hearing your stories, to understand your struggles and to collectively create the foundations to answer these monumental questions. Editor's note: We are building a collaborative bid for the MacArhur Foundation's 100 Million USD with our peers in 40 + countires. You are very welcome to join us if you are doing work at the intersections of care, open knowledge and technologies, and communities.

In April 2016, the production of industrial hemp was legalized by the Greek state after 60 long years of prohibition, introducing new opportunities and markets to a country that is trying to get back on its feet. It’s been a long known fact that Greece’s agriculture and farming sectors have significant growth potential, especially for organic production and niche products/markets. With the right climate, soil, and geographical diversity, we believe that hemp cultivation can flourish in Greece. As a result of recent legislation, we established KANNABIO, the first organic hemp social cooperative in the country, just a few days after the ministerial decision was signed.KANNABIO has as a mission to promote Greek hemp as a quality product of origin and assist the development of the industry in Greece. Our goal is to get involved in organic and cooperative farming and processing, to produce quality organic hemp products, to promote the social and solidarity economy and protect the environment. Moreover, we undertake participatory research on hemp cultivation and processing, raise awareness about the benefits of hemp for the economy and the environment, while providing expertise, networking and promotion opportunities to local farmers.Our founding members are involved in hemp trade since 1998 and are at the forefront of the legalization campaign in Greece since 2005. Two of the farmers-partners of KANNABIO are among the first three farmers to receive permission for hemp cultivation in Greece in 2016. Both of them owned hemp shops that were raided by police in 1998 and their products (clothes) were confiscated, while they faced a lengthy trial period for many years before they got acquitted but never compensated.KANNABIO’s vision for Greek organic hemp is to become an international standard of organic quality through cooperative cultivation and processing. We want to lay the foundations for the promotion and sustainable use of the plant, and we want to actively contribute to the establishment of a healthy and cooperative hemp market in Greece, by supporting sustainable agricultural practices and rural development. As such, we oversee the production of organic hemp oil extraction products, nutritional supplements, and personal hygiene products, as well as the production of hemp-lime for eco-friendly building materials.We want to promote cooperative principles and a philosophy of working collaboratively. We don’t focus narrowly on the commercial side of hemp, but our aim is to provide awareness, training, engagement, jobs and social consciousness, alongside the production of quality, organic health and nutrition products. In this effort, we aim to create novel healthy products that can contribute daily to the health of citizens, but also provide natural and accessible supplements to patients of various serious diseases.Currently, we are finalizing a business investment plan in order to attract investment for establishing a small-scale cooperative production unit of hemp oils, hemp nutritional and personal hygiene products. Our production target for 2017 is to sign contracts with farmers for 25 hectares. In parallel, KANNABIO hemp co-op has developed a more integrated vision for cooperative hemp cultivation and processing in Greece, to support the establishment of the Greek hemp industry. This includes the creation of a mobile Hemp Caravan Museum that will travel all around Greece visiting different cities, organizing public events with guest speakers and guided exhibition tours for key stakeholders (farmers, processors, traders, public officials) and the wider public.This action will bridge the knowledge gap that 60 years of hemp prohibition created and will contribute to capacity building and sensitization of farmers, professionals on the market and consumers about prospects of cooperative hemp cultivation and processing. Moreover, our cooperative vision includes the creation of a large-scale hemp processing unit producing fiber, shivs, flowers, seeds and dust, also including a production line of hemp insulation and construction material.Cooperative business planThe social cooperative will employ by priority unemployed, skilled youth and women, 35% of its net earnings will be reinvested in the cooperative, its employees and the creation of new jobs, while it will be governed by its shareholders. The shareholders will hold one vote each in the General Assembly, independently of the amount of shares they own (no more than 5% of the company share value for each shareholder).We strongly believe and we have proposed to state authorities that in Greece, we have the capacity and the potential for the creation of 10 cooperative processing units in 10 different regions, that will be able to process at least 2.500 hectares each, by utilizing abandoned industrial facilities all over the country. Our long-term vision is the Cooperative Greek Hemp Industry to cultivate and process 25.000 hectares of hemp in 10-15 years time, converting more land into sustainable practices.Finally, our cooperative plan includes the establishment of a non-profit Hemp R&D Foundation that will develop Greek hemp breeds by utilizing past and ongoing research and will provide technical support for cultivation and processing. The Foundation will also provide applied research and applications on cooperative schemes and practices for hemp cultivation and processing.
FairCoop is, in fact, a lot of projects with a unifying mission behind all of them: to build alternative, grassroots-driven economy, which will be participatory, fair and belong to the people. All of the members of our global collective want to see that happen.  The FairCoop Thessaloniki is a local group linked to the global movement. We’re all dealing in different ways with the establishment of tools and processes that would bring about alternative, cooperative economies.  In the case of our city, to some extent, it’s done by implementation of alternative cryptocurrency, faircoin, developed by the FairCoop. We try to understand ways in which this currency, and a local currency introduced after the crisis, can coexist and supplement each other. In any case, the goal is to free ourselves from proprietary technologies and capitalist banking systems - by creating a parallel circular model, ideally connecting and supporting a whole ecosystem of projects locally and globally.  There is also the ambition to create a health care system within the communities by implementing the same solutions and building autonomous, community managed and driven scheme, highly independent from the existing one. For example, it could be done by using the percentage of community’s income to fund health care. It could even in the future take shape of an autonomous security system. Considering the increasingly ubiquitous 3D technology, many of the medical tools can be soon printed cheaply by anyone. Small ethical pharmaceuticals will be able to produce their own medicine. And all the wealth that is sucked up from the communities will stay there, making them stronger and independent. It is already the case in Spain, where after 6 years of experiments in the communities of all kinds a lot of generated income has been fed back and used to build, support projects, create systems of all kinds.  We also plan to replace the public system with a cooperative one. For now, it’s a hurdle - but in the future, it will be possible. The condition? The strong community behind it.  FairCoop exists since 2 years, and in Thessaloniki, it started a few months ago. We have links with dozens of cooperatives, organizations, initiatives and communities - such as Bitcoin community, P2P foundation, Catalonia Cooperative, etc. We’ve brought on board more than 1000 people so far. Yet, there’s still a lot to be done. We need to connect and build stronger alliances even in the cities - in Thessaloniki, many existing initiatives remain disconnected from each other. We need to develop models of integral cooperation on different levels. Bring decentralized technologies to local communities to make them more resilient. And seed the idea of cooperation, which will replace competition. 
I have been working as a trauma therapist since 10 years. It’s not an area that many psychotherapists decide to explore in their daily practice, but ever since I can remember it was the most appealing area of psychotherapy for me. And one that is highly unexplored and somehow underrepresented.  One of the reasons why I decided to try Trauma Tour is my exchange with a patient over Twitter. We’ve been talking online for a very long time about her experience, as she cannot come and see me in Belgium. And then I thought, I should be able to go and see her.  We, psychotherapists, stay in our daily practices. We don’t move. We don’t reach out and explain things to people. We do things with individuals - why not try to work with a group, and talk to a group? This is what I’d rather do. The more I thought about it, the more sense it made.  Eventually I bought a bus. My very first tour this week goes to Ghent, where I already have connected with potential participants. It will be a chance for me to see in what ways I can connect with groups. How to talk to people about trauma? How to equip them with knowledge and capacity to deal with their own experiences? And what could  be a possible model for sustaining the project, as I really want to go far with my tour, reaching the Balkans, Greece, visit communities out there. Ultimately, I’d also like to volunteer in refugee camps and serve with my knowledge and experience there (I do work in an asylum center in Belgium once a week).  During the preparation for the tour I have realised there is a big interest in the topic already - people really want to know more about trauma. I’ve already taken a step towards promoting awareness and dealing with the problem - I wrote a book about trauma last year. The book became quite popular, and it’s now being translated from Dutch to English. It will be available in January, and it is based on common licence, along with the exercises included. This decision is based on my view that psychological knowledge, and therapeutical knowledge, are all based on dozens of years of collective practice and wisdom accumulated which should be available to everyone without limitations, certifications, individualisation... I need to extend my network now in order to connect with communities and groups that would like to host me. I could be travelling from one place to another this way, knowing there would be support and people to talk to. I need to figure out best ways to sustain myself - travelling for long would cost me my patients, and a source of income. If you’d like to give me a tip, share an idea, help me prepare the tour - leave a comment.  
About two months ago, we set out to convene a smart swarm of grassroots initiatives to renew health and social care. The idea was big and ambitious: cast communities  as care providers, alongside the state and private business. We had decided to run for a 100 million dollars grant, the MacArthur's Foundation 100&Change. But not as an organization. We would run as a smart swarm of grassroots initiatives around care.We have researched "care by communities" in the opencare project. We fancy ourselves experts in the field. But this new task was not research: it was design. How could all those independent local initiatives combine a in a tentative system-level solution? No way this could happen through scaling grassroots initiatives. They are so fast end efficient because they mobilize local resources: skills, mutual trust, capital, institutions. They should scale as far as these resources extend, but no further. No, what we needed was an ecosystem, an organic mosaic of local solutions. We needed to think like biologists, not like engineers. There was only one problem: you can't design an ecosystems. Ecosystems evolve. They are so fast, efficient, diverse and beautiful precisely because no one agency controls them. Hell, they die if you try to control them too tightly. So, we did not try to design care by community at scale. Instead, we designed a context that speeds up mutation, adaptation, exchange (both cultural and economic) and selection of grassroots initiatives. The key is to hardcode incentives for them to want to interact. With no interactivity there is no ecosystem; if it does not have links, it's not a network.I hate application forms just as much as the next guy, but this one was a lot of fun. It felt right, honest. It is so strange that we could see no point in trying to bullshit the judges into selecting us. We are proposing something different, and scary, and exciting. If they go for it, better they go with their eyes wide open. But there is something else that makes me think we are on the right track. This: everybody hates the grant cycle. It just does not work, and it has to go. Putting money on the table attracts the sharks as well as the good guys, and the sharks have an advantage: they don't care about the problems, they only need to please the grant giver. Grant givers know this, so they respond by putting in place rules and control systems to keep the sharks away. But of course the sharks mutate, camouflage. They go to the right conferences. They talk to funders. They pick up the exciting new concepts and ape them, turning them into hollow buzzwords. So the grant givers erect new barriers, and so on. The result is an arms race. The losers are the doers, who need to spend more and more time differentiating themselves from the parasites. Some of them even give up, focus more and more on getting the next grant, and become parasites themselves. In the grant cycle nobody can hear you scream.This won't happen in Open&Change. For two reasons. First, there is no incentive to become a parasite. If we win, we win as a swarm. MacArthur will perceive the swarm, not the single organizations. Our best path to prosperity is to avoid mission drift, use the swarm to get our initiative off the ground, and never have to chase a grant again. Second, we are not alone. We share the grant with hundreds of peers. They can and should be our partners, suppliers, clients, friends. The grant brings us together, instead of driving us apart in a competitive logic. Against all the odds, I am quite upbeat about Open&Change. It feels like we are onto something. Judge for yourself: we have published a draft application form in Creative Commons. You are welcome to read, comment, and help make it better. If you are a potential competitor feel free to use it, but please do credit us, as per the terms of the license. Learn more on Open&Change
In August 2015, as the first large waves of refugees started landing on the Greek shores and stuck along the border of Idomeni, I started this initiative of collecting and filling backpacks with first need items for refugees. At first, this has started very modestly, with a few friends organizing clothing donations through the Facebook https://www.facebook.com/%CE%A3%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BDBackpacks-for-the-RefugeesSolutions-for-Homeless-148172338861553/?ref=bookmarks . At the beginning, I wasn’t expending such a big response to my call, but volunteers -known and unknown- started visiting my clothing shop in Thessaloniki, bringing clothes and helping out to fill in the backpacks.Within two months, this action spread virally all over Greece. Over time, I networked with other grassroots initiatives active in refugee care, such as the Alternative Immigrant Centre of Thessaloniki (@To-Steki) and Oikopolis. In some cases, people followed our instructions and respected our philosophy of unconditional giving, but there have also been problematic cases because there were also people that tried to hijack the process for personal gain.I have learned to live with the dynamics, and I started helping out at Oikopolis, to create a clothing storage, explaining an internationally used methodology of inventorying, so refugees were able to serve themselves on their own. This system still works, where refugees can come, try and take the clothes they need for free.While continuing to work with clothes, I now focus on providing school items for children and the campaign has shifted focus. From just catering for refugees, we also provide care for native homeless people. Through a Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/519478964902645/, we are trying to organize volunteers who adopt the schooling needs/items of children in need. These needs may be covered through a donation of items or money, and this is open to everyone. So far, the stock gathered so far through donations, is enough for about 250 kids. In parallel, I am organizing seminars and crash courses on repairing clothes and upcycling old objects to create, for example, pencil boxes.There is another task, which is more time-consuming and complex, in terms of research. I'm in the team-building process that will eventually become a non-profit legal entity, to develop a Handbook for the Management of Material and Resources, in cases of emergency. For example, due to my professional background, I know how to sort and store thousands of clothing items. Somebody else might have other skills. This is also connected with the sharing of knowledge of alternative treatments, practices or hacks, that might offer cheap and practical solutions to people in need. For example, using cocoa powder as a shampoo, or other uses of baking  soda, salt, etc.I come from Thessaloniki, and my ancestors were refugees. Initially, the response from my immediate environment has been disappointing. My job is in the clothing sector, however, being an elected Municipal Councillor at the City of Thessaloniki, people know my public activity so it was easy to build trust. Furthermore, I am sitting at the Management Board to the Municipal TV100 station. Having many contacts with journalists helped to communicate the action widely. All this combined has resulted in the massive spontaneous response of a community of 1500 citizens from all walks of life. Including people from Europe and the US, who donated waterproof jackets and blankets.As s municipal councilor, I am in contact with local authorities. Sadly the Municipality responded very poorly, compared to what it could do. Same goes with the Ministry of Immigration Policy. We talked to the consultants, they appreciated our effort, but there was no practical result.Unfortunately, the public sentiment is negative. Mass media shape the opinion that the refugees stopped crossing borders, so people believe that they stopped coming. Others falsely believe that refugees are to blame for anything wrong. And since the beginning of the summer, most volunteers disappeared. This has, inevitably, resulted in a fatigue in the area of refugee care.Nevertheless, I have no other option but continue. I wish to launch a crowdsourcing campaign, so the venture can continue. I imagine of a list of people with different skills, who -in the case of need- will be ready to take up a certain role. A type of inventory of what human assets exist and what everyone can contribute.
Breathing Games (www.breathinggames.net) promotes respiratory health by encouraging the appropriation of care by each citizen.We create a common – collectively managed resources that are freely accessible and can be used and enriched by everyone – by spurring collaboration between all interested stakeholders to build on collective intelligenceThe project concentrates on healthy behaviours and has been developed collectively with patient associations, health institutions, universities and other organisations.The games produced participatorily are meant to improve the quality and life expectancy of people with respiratory problems – by educating, transforming therapy into games, and promoting healthy habits. They can be reused and adapted by everyone to address local problems and needs, as long as the free/libre and open-source licences are maintained. We also develop open-source hardware such as flowmeter for domesic use. This material shall enable everyone, in all countries, to get indicators about his health (lung capacity tests), and shall also provide decentralized, anonimyzed data to advance public health research (blockchain/IPFS).On top of that we have been building a community of people to further develop and distribute the games. We successfully organized gamejams about cystic fibrosis and asthma in Switzerland and in Canada, and plan other events on breathing health and chronic respiratory diseases in the next months. The audience is huge: 1 out of 5 people in the world suffer from chronic respiratory diseases, and half of them do not follow the therapy as agreed with their caregiver.Key to the success of this initiative is the socio-economic, non-exclusive model we developed, as well as the platform we use to log contributions and redistribute to the contributors the raised funds. We use agile development methodologies and allow members to self-organise, so that we build on the collective intelligence and transform ideas into sustainable, scalable products and services.The participatory, inclusive approach enables us to build research-backed games that also are attractive and fun to play with. Interdisciplinarity helps us gain a multifaceted, holistic vision of healthcare and fosters collaboration between different parties, beyond institutions and countries. That is key in tackling challenges in health care.Through games, therapy can become a more joyful practice – would you like to follow a tedious, boring therapy one hour daily, as children with cystic fibrosis do since they are 4 years old?Are you also interested in employing entertaining, game-like elements in the health care system and therapy?Is there a health-related challenge in your neighbourhood, community, which you think you could solve by employing similar approach?Do you have some experience in creating health-related apps and props?Share your story or drop a comment, let us know about it!Breathing Games is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact and of the Open Source Initiative.Discover more about us at www.breathinggames.net
a story how a team started a medical camp with the intention to help as amany people as possible who otherwise would have not received care,Medical camps have been running in partnership with the villages of Bupsa and Bumburi attract local people from miles around, many of whom walk for many hours and often days to attend the camps. These medical camps are led by Nepalese professionals who are assisted by qualified volunteers and medical and dentistry students from the UK.The long and expensive journey to the hospitals in Laksha and Kathmandu (sometimes taking days) are out-of-reach for the majority living in these low-income communities. Their main source of income is from subsistence farming and small profits are often shared throughout the community. So as you can imagine, when word gets out that these clinics are nearby, villagers flock to them in the hope of securing a cure for their health issues. There are currently no permanent doctors in the region, which is home to a large, ethnically diverse population, spread over a number of rural communities made up of low income households. People lack access to basic health care and specialist treatment and have to walk for many days to attend the nearest hospital or else take the long and expensive journey to Kathmandu. The medical camps provide free consultation, treatment and advice from specialist qualified doctors as well as access to free medication. The goal is to one day provide the communities in these remote Himalayan villages with permanent medical care and qualified staff, rather than a temporary clinic run from an outbuilding of Bupsa’s monastery.The group that started the initiative were limited to leftover equipment from the previous clinics and a small amount of supplies that they carried in with them.  One of the most common problems witnessed were musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs are a widely spread problem facing porters and farming communities who endure hard physical labour day-in-day-out. Muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments and nerves can all be affected, causing discomfort to intense pain. The reduction of these disorders caused through employment is a key objective of the EU through its Community Strategy, proving just how fortunate we are to benefit from accessible healthcare.Read the full story here:  http://wildernessmedicinemagazine.com/article.asp?id=1026https://mmtrust.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/wilderness-medicine-in-nepal/
The vision of Families of Color Seattle (FOCS) is that our children of color are born into a loving community that is racially and economically just. To work towards this, FOCS’ mission is to build a strong community by supporting families of color through parenting programs, resource sharing and fostering meaningful connections. For example, programs include regular parenting groups led by trained parent facilitators of color, multi-cultural art classes for kids and adults, and community events and resources on relevant topics for families of color. FOCS is unique in providing safe spaces where families of color can build community with a focus on race, identity, culture and ethnicity through a lens of social and racial justice.  Since our founding in 2013, FOCS has evolved into an active base of over 1000 interethnic, intercultural families of color in South Seattle and the greater Seattle/King County area in Pacific Northwest of United States of America. .Born out of the desire for alternatives to mainstream parenting groups, FOCS tackles serious challenges head on. There is a lack of effective opportunities for community dialogues on race and family. Culturally-relevant and multiracial parenting resources are unknown or unwritten. Mainstream organizations aren’t committed to anti-racist policies and practices for our children of color. And families of color seek a safe community where shared experiences and cultural understanding are the norm.Today, FOCS is a nonprofit organization led by women of color including the Executive Director and Founder Amy Pak as well as FOCS’ 7-member board of directors. Prior to incorporation, core volunteers dedicated hundreds of hours to evolve and solidify the needs of our community based on what we’d be hearing from our families. We have grown from an all-volunteer start-up group to one that is led by .5 FTE staff, 2 interns, 1 Rainier Valley Corps Fellow, professional and diverse Board of directors and hundreds of dedicated family volunteers. It is critical to us that FOCS employs and utilizes the assets of our parents of color network for “peer to peer” learning and sharing. This builds strong community and ensures our voices are lifted up and valued.  Since 2013, 30 parent groups have been organized, providing weekly support and reduced social isolation for over 180 parenting group participants. FOCS ARTS cultural arts programming has engaged over 800 families in fun, interactive, multicultural learning opportunities. The FOCS online community forum involves resources sharing between over 430 families of color.  In 2015-16, FOCS successfully executed five dialogues in Seattle around issues of equity on race/multiracial identity, anti-bias education, reproductive justice, and transracial adoption and included a total of 500 people and 75 volunteers. Our reach is wide and it is getting stronger. FOCS was recently awarded the Ron Chisom Anti-Racism Award by the Seattle Services Coalition for our work in racial justice for families. The ceremony was June 1,2016 at City Hall, Seattle.FOCS, a non-profit, was eventually founded in 2013 and it is now a women-led organization which connects parents and builds a loving community of families of color in Seattle. We’ve discovered a growing demand from families of color, young parents, transracial adoptive families, multi-national,, multiracial families growing in Seattle, yet the city remains 70% white with growing displacement of families of color, immigrant and low income communities not being able to afford America’s city with the quickest rising cost of living in the nation. Seattle also boosts America’s largest multi-racial identifying people and also reflects where children of color are the majority nationally in Kindergarten.  FOCS fosters meaningful connects, engages parents and children with cultural arts, but also providing a platform where they can discuss everything, from returning work to breastfeeding, race, community, identity and social justice. It’s a powerful combination of professions, education, traditions and backgrounds. Our impact has been deep and quick, we have connected over 1000 families and trained and employed more than 35 parents as Parent Educators and Teaching Artists.FOCS initially opened Cornerstone Cafe in Fall of 2014. The space offered a drop-in child care, and a cultural arts program including capoeira and Hawaiian and Spanish talk story. We now operate FOCS ARTS cultural arts programming for 0-7 year olds with parents each week, facilitate community dialogues on race and family, parenting groups for newborns and waddlers and consult and provide race and equity workshops for parents and educators at preschools and elementary schools.We became part of commuinity led de-gentrification of South Seattle, where our community resources reflect the historical community of residents. Instead, FOCS members are connected by the culture of inclusivity, community building and play-centered learning. Our values are women of color and mother leadership, racial equity, economic impact, dismantling racism, education equity, and an intercultural interethnic community. We envision a world where children of color are born into a loving community that is racially and economically just. One Filipina American mother of mixed race Filipino, Salvadorian and White two young boys said about FOCS,“I gave birth to my first son in 2010. My pregnancy was difficult, it was unplanned, my relationship was unstable, my partner was unemployed and I suffered internal bleeding during the first trimester resulting in an emergency surgery; I often cried during my prenatal appointments, and the midwives expressed concern that I was at risk for post-partum depression and they recommended joining a parent group when my baby arrived to build a supportive community. My son arrived 3 weeks early and the birth was long and ended in a c-section. When my baby arrived I continued to face difficulty. My son was very small but healthy, but he failed to gain weight as I was unable to produce the milk he needed, and he rarely slept more than 2 hours at a time for nearly the first 6 months of his life. I had never felt more scared, tired, or overwhelmed. After 6 months I went back to my midwife with signs of Postpartum Depression and worked with my health care providers and my partner on a plan to help me manage my symptoms and the stressors in my life.Looking back through this experience what was missing from my life was an opportunity to build authentic relationships and community with other mothers. I was part of a parent group, but never felt like I could be myself in these groups and share what was going on in mothering experience and within myself. I often felt lonely and isolated even in the presence of the group. I attribute this experience to having a space where both mothers and partners were included as well as the facilitation of the group which focused primarily on the baby and not on the identity or needs of the parent. When I joined a FOCS (Families of Color Seattle) group last Spring, after the birth of my second son, I knew I found the place I had yearned for earlier in my motherhood. The circumstances with the birth of my second were entirely different so I was in a better place emotionally, physically, and financially, but I know that every mother still needs support and community.What I found with FOCS was an intentional space to build authentic relationships and community. As mothers we are welcomed in and acknowledged as whole people with cultures, professions, fears and passions, not just as care taker of a child. FOCS openly discusses and acknowledges race, ethnicity, culture, language, and identity and its importance in motherhood, parenting, and raising children. In my experience these topics were left out of other traditional parenting groups in the community. When these topics are left out, people of color and their experiences are neglected and excluded. When FOCS brings our multiple identities to the forefront the result is more authentic conversation and relationship building. My first year with my second son has been extremely positive and I attribute much of this to my on-going connection with FOCS. I felt supported as an individual and mother, and was able to transfer the love I felt to the love I share with my child. It is so important to provide support for mothers so that we can be better mothers. I believe that the strength of the community that is being built is a testimony of the need that families of color in Seattle are looking for spaces to connect".
We chose Thessaloniki as a good location for our workshop, due to the active social web that is active in the city since the financial crisis hit home in 2009. Being Greece's second biggest city, and the largest city of the country's North, Thessaloniki boasts with life, with a vibrant culture that is merging optimally the city's laid back flair, with its rich history, the university community and contemporary culture. In the last years, Thessaloniki is emerging as a lively incubator of several grassroots initiatives. The first urban gardening projects of Greece happened here, when a group of citizens occupied a former army camp. Social enterprises, consumers networks, activist groups and a significant arts scene are here at home.The workshop took place on September 3rd, 2016, inviting socially active citizens in the wider field of care. In many cases, these people are not strangers to each other. The city is neither too big, nor too small, and people that care are often meeting each other in the numerous gatherings, events and activities organised at the grassroots.Τhe workshop offered an open space to meet and discuss, using several tools for harnessing collective intelligence. Using various participatory methodologies, such as World Café, participants mapped out the status quo, how they would imagine Care in Greece in 10 years from now, while engaging into framing this transition.Mapping the status quoThe current care system of Greece is characterised by mainstream centralised structures defined (and accepted) by the public health system, marked by chronic problems related to inefficiency, corruption and lack of funding. The severity of the ongoing financial crisis in Greece has further incapacitated the public care system, but it has given rise to a milieu of social, citizen-led projects who leverage volunteerism to care for the most under-privileged parts of the society.Besides public hospitals and private clinics, these structures harbour initiatives ranging from non-profit actions by international and domestic NGOs or philanthropic organisations (including the church), to volunteer initiatives and informal groups. Over the last years, such initiatives have focused on the distribution of primary need goods (ie. clothes, food, education), based on a strong narrative around the solidarity and exchange economy. In parallel with citizen-led initiatives, many city councils have launched municipal Social Grocery stores or Pharmacies. In many cases, local community action is combined with public social structures.Citizen imagine Care in Greece in 10 yearsCitizens were asked to engage into collaborative dialogue on the future of care in Greece, using the World Café method. Participants were divided in two groups and shared ideas on different and multi-level care structures. People from one group swapped with the other, in oder to cross-polinate their knowledge which was later harvested to reveal interesting connnections between different aspects of care.The new paradigm focuses on synergies at different levels, putting emphasis on notions and ideas that bring people together, build trust, strengthen relationships in communities. From the level of housing, neighbourhoods and schools, all the way to managing structures of public health and social care. Interesting ideas were shared from participants, for example how we can train care stuff in novel and specialised approaches such as "preventive" mourning. Others talk of the need for communal spaces in blocks of flat, where residents can share tools or creative moments, enhancing social interaction in the buildings they live.For the participants, the future of care innovation is closely connected to openess and the availability of public space. Not surprisingly, many people appreciated the power of urban gardening in offering green spaces, but also in building a sense of community in the neighbourhood. The transition to such a system is not without obstacles, especially by virtue of the lack of political sense in the crisis-stricken country that is experiencing the deepest recession since World War II. Nevertheless, after 7 years of fighting the crisis, some cells inside the society start having a very clear idea about the pathway forward.To visualise these change dynamics, participants were asked to engage into Transition Framing, investigating aspects of the care system that should be continued, eliminated, improved or complemented.The care communities of Greece are the unsung heroes of this crisis. They formed quickly, evolve slowly and are present where both and the public sector fail: providing free, open care to the most sensitive target groups (ie. homeless, elderly, immigrants). Given the financial, political and administrative support they diserve, these communities could transform the game, and offer the hope of recovery to all Greeks, but also Europe as a whole.
Tópio is empowering high-school students, training them to become the catalysts of change in their own neighbourhoods. We strongly believe that the re-use of public space can improve the physical, mental and psychological health of urban dwellers. For this reason, we focus on the importance of connecting healthy cities and “placemaking”.The pilot version of the project took place at the 19th High school of Thessaloniki from December 2015 to May 2016. The name of the project is a combination of the Greek words “Topío” (place) and “Tópi” (ball), which points to youthfulness, games and children.photo credits: Olympia Datsistencils: Pop-Up & Paper StoriesOur vision is to re-imagine the school as an open platform of discussion and interaction for the whole neighbourhood, where students lead the transformation both inside and outside its premises. We wish to get youngsters caring for their local community and public space, by initiating cultural and other activities. At first, these take place inside the school building and yard, and are then transferred out to the neighbourhood, eventually empowering them to invite the local community inside the school.Our team focuses on enriching original and location-specific ideas with data, information and constant interaction between the local community and the public space. Based on previous experience, we develop various educational tools for “placemaking” that are not previously known to the local communities.Although the whole process meets several obstacles, such as bureaucracy, we remain focused on our vision, trying to seek collaboration with the municipality and other local authorities. However, it is very important for us to preserve our self-organization and encourage bottom-up action.photo credits: Vivian DoumpaWho benefits from Tópio?Youth (school kids & university students) wishing to become catalysts of change in their own neighbourhood in collaboration with their teachers.Local communities wishing to contribute to social cohesion and upgrading the urban landscape.Everyone who wants to be active and participate in the development and co-formation of public spaces.Tópio kick-started as a pilot project within the framework of the START: Create Cultural Change, by Robert Bosch Stiftung conducted in cooperation with the Goethe-Institut Thessaloniki and the Bundesvereinigung Soziokultureller Zentren e.V. (German Association of Sociocultural Centers). So far, the project has attracted the attention of the press and several European organisations. For example, we are very proud of our involvement in the project “The City at Eye Level” working with Dutch “Stipo” and other practitioners.We are reaching out to citizens through a dedicated website and our Facebook page, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.photo credits: Callie Vei & Alexandr EmmanouilidisThe people behind the ideaMy name is Vivian Doumpa and in my early 30s, I have a degree in Urban-Regional Planning & Development Engineering, and I am a post-graduate in Urban Geography specialised in music in public spaces. I have a long-life education in music, and I am currently participating in a project of the research team “Critical Music Histories”. I am also the co-founder of “Creativity Platform”, a non-profit, collective scheme, seeking to function as an interdisciplinary platform of exchanging ideas, actions, research and applications related to the “creative capital” and the “creative economy” in the city of Thessaloniki as well as the whole of Greece in general. Since 2016, Tópio is a significant part of this collective scheme. Being in charge of the project, I had the chance to enrich my professional experience with technical seminars in Project Management (Germany), in the field of Cultural Management. It was a great challenge to combine Urban-Regional Planning and enhancement of active citizenship with creative means.My partner, Olympia Datsi, works as a freelance trainer and mentor in the european/international volunteering field and non-formal education, co-ordinating youth projects. Moreover, her educational background based on Landscape Architecture, Interior Design and Fine Arts. She is in charge of the educational activities of Tópio, dealing with communication, training and empowerment of high-school students and citizens. Since 2013, she is also co-founder of the “Creativity Platform” and has a massive interest for sociology and public space.photo credits: Victoria DatsiAs with all like-minded people, our professional relationship and friendship run on the basis of trust and respect. After all these collaborations in multiple projects, we have learned many things from each other’s capacities. We have taught ourselves what is the best way to move forward with the project: from sensing children’s needs and stimulating their interest in the public space, to approaching municipal stakeholders.This good spirit of synergy and way of thinking and acting helps us to make progress. And we enjoy this feeling of pleasure and satisfaction when people get motivated by our ideas. One of them is my mother, who is really supportive and active in our interventions in the neighbourhood. Although in the first place it was quite hard for her to understand what actually “placemaking” is about.photo credits: Vivian DoumpaArtworks: Theano G. & Felix Felis
Hello everyone, as a followup to my previous post on education, I want to dive a little deeper for our Fellowship post.ReaGent is an open biolab where anyone from any background can tinker with biology. We organize practical workshops for children from all backgrounds to get them in touch with biology in a fun way. We do this because the role of biological technologies will become increasingly bigger as we move towards a circular society. Education plays a fundamental role in allowing people to be a part of this process.Why are we doing this? My personal motivation is best shown through a memory from my biotechnological engineering studies. We went on a company visit to Monsanto. At the time, I was not particularly aware of the dirty business they were in. We got to see the production facility, water treatment installations and large glyphosate tanks, which are all used to produce Roundup. During the luxurious lunch, which Monsanto employees also attended, a fellow student whispered to me: “how can they sleep at night, considering they work for such a questionable company?”. That was the only thing that I heard about the issue from anyone at school, both teachers or students. I didn’t (now to my shame) know anything about Monsanto at the time and had to look it up myself afterwards. I was baffled and disgusted. What are we teaching our students?Aside from the perspective we teach, relevance is important as well. I hated biology in high school. If you had told me I’d be a bioengineer someday, I would have laughed in disbelief. The content of biology class often remains descriptive (you learn about the parts of a plant cell), while higher education and jobs are all about application (you use these plant cells to grow something useful, like a building). A child that likes engineering, design and coding should consider studying biology. This is fundamental if we want enough people to develop sustainable technologies for the future.ReaGent has been going for about a year. We’ve experimented with several ways to bring biology closer to society. We've had children work with enzymes, build their own microscope, extract DNA and much more. The coming year, we will expand to reach more children and this scale-up entails several challenges.Cell divisionAs a first step, we have decided to continue the project under a new name: Ecoli. The DIY biolab in Ghent will stay as ReaGent, while Ecoli will provide biology education to children and underprivileged groups. A DIYbio space or biohackerspace and child education are not very compatible regarding administrative or legal aspects, like insurance and licenses. Another reason for the split is the different story we want to tell.The story to inspire a citizen scientist or biohacker is different from the story to inspire a child. Moreover, DIYbio has had issues with public perception. We find it important that knowledge is spread equally and that everyone can participate in an open discussion. We would not like a distorted image to shape decisions and opinions of people, leading them to self-censor and potentially miss out on learning opportunities.The creativity, mindset and ethics present in a DIYbio lab strengthen and form the way we educate. We feel like we get the benefits without the drawbacks if the DIY biolab and educational project are two separate entities.Funding education in a fair wayThe question that I posed in the initial post was on how to fund education outside of, but as an addition to, the traditional state-funded system.Making a project like this financially sustainable is a challenge. The groups where we have our biggest impact, and thus create the most value, are also least capable of paying for it. We have set up a way to partially fund this by doing workshops in the classical school circuit. Our impact there is equally important and they can afford to pay (a little) for our services. It remains to be seen if we can sustain ourselves in the long term.Chances are, we will have to find funds elsewhere –government or industry. Government is the obvious choice, since education falls under their responsibility. Though, as often with government, it would be naïve to count on funding. Additionally, it entails somewhat of an administrative burden (especially in Belgium and the EU) and it’s a slow process.So, do we want to cooperate with big biotech companies? How will this affect what we want to achieve with Ecoli? Do we risk that public opinion, or opinions of parents, ultimately influences what a child learns? Biotech has plenty of shortcomings –funding and market mechanisms, ethical, ecological and the list goes on. But it’s a technology, a tool that can be used for good and bad. The drawbacks that I mentioned are effects of the way it is used and not inherent to the technology. If we are scared of biotech, it is because we are scared of ourselves, and rightfully so.We still have the option of telling a nuanced story. Especially if we can highlight these issues during education, which is a rarity. My personal Monsanto experience is only one example.Caring with scienceMore fundamentally, care is everyone’s responsibility in one way or another. Earlier this week, one of our team members went to visit an institute that accompanies people with a mental disability. He visited them to explain what we do and to offer them biology workshops for their audience, the responsible’s jaw dropped as she launched off in enthusiasm, pointing out all the ways we could cooperate. She said nobody ever thought of deeming their people worthy of science oriented workshops. Even if it’s just for entertainment, science or technology can be used for care. People have a tendency to underestimate capabilities of certain groups, like little kids or special needs people. On the other hand, there’s a tendency to overestimate the intelligence required to grasp or play with basic principles. The power lies in how it’s communicated.This is only one of plenty of groups that don’t get equal chances for quality education. It is part of the mission of Ecoli to provide those groups the opportunity to learn and discover.Beyond the toolsWe are likely at the start of a similar revolution like the digital revolution. That means we have the chance to try and anticipate this time round; to try and prepare people; to embed values, like openness and inclusiveness, that make sure we don’t need to fix the problems of accessibility and literacy afterwards.What we do can be considered an experiment and in many ways, it’s not necessarily about biology. We hope that, in addition to growing a basic biological literacy, we help to build a shift in attitude. When we watch global developments, it is clear that the biggest problems we face don’t require technological solutions. Even problems that are directly caused by a misuse of technology, like climate change, could be headed towards a solution by changing our attitude, especially when combined with more sustainable bio-based technologies. A change in behaviour is not likely to happen overnight, but if we can build institutions that promote caring, collaboration and trust, we might be on our way.We are engaging with the Edgeryders community because we hope our actions can be part of a bigger solution. One where different actors work on improving their respective fields. By sharing experiences of our project with the Edgeryders community we hope we can grow more resilience for everyone.We will be attending the workshop in Brussels on the 24th of September and would be delighted to meet you!If you connect to our story, let us know! We love feedback and discussing the subject. Here’s some other questions that occupy our mind. Should this type of initiative stay an addition to the state-funded system? Is this form of bottom-up activism, independent of the government or in spite of it, ultimately a desirable strategy?The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
I started my journey as a science and economics student. After graduation, I spent years working for French and international industrial companies, after which I quit and went on to work in the humanitarian field throughout Southeast Asia. With the arrival of new technologies and the community approach using the Internet to connect people, it became clear to me that there are now widespread and relatively cheap tools of empowerment readily available. Upon my return to Europe, I decided to work on the development of such ideas. This led to the inception of the echOpen project.The idea started from a chat among friends, an engineer (Luc) previously employed in the ultrasound industry, a mathematician and physician (Mehdi) and a radiologist (Pierre). We discussed smartphones: widespread devices that are more sophisticated than the computers that sent people to the moon a few decades ago.How could we use this technology to improve health care, considering that now almost everyone have one in his/her pocket?This idea emerged as a combination of our passion for open technology and community engagement. Using technologies that have existed since the 70s,with a bit of tweaking, are cheap and perfectly functional to make this idea come true. We then give access to these tools and knowledge to anyone interested, and to encourage them to try new things out.This is how our mission came about. We plan to develop the very first Open Source, affordable ultrasound probe (echo-stethoscope) dedicated to diagnosis orientation, based on open source hardware and software principles. It will be cheaper than any of the fancy machines you can find on the market. There already are some ultraportable ultrasound scanners out there, but they cost several thousand Euros  our goal is to divide the price by 10-15 times. This device will be able to produce a medical image that you can then transport to your smartphone or laptop. It’s a device that every health care professional will want to carry in their pocket - allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis orientation, which means faster and better medical care. As a preventive tool, it will reduce the number of patients who need emergency help. It can save the lives of mothers who die in developing countries during their pregnancies. Our tool will also spark more interactions between professionals and patients.We launched the project in late 2014, but the actual work really began in August 2015. Hosted by the hospital Hotel Dieu, right next to the Notre Dame in Paris, we have an open space with an interesting, eclectic ecosystem of researchers, community members, senior professionals working in the technical and medical areas of ultrasound technology, radiologists, experts in echography, medical laboratories, universities, and schools, etc.Earlier this year, we developed a functional prototype of the tool - it works, but the quality of the image is not satisfactory. With the involvement of more than 200 people, mostly from France but also in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, we are now improving the quality of echOpen. Our deadline to complete the new medical-quality prototype is this December.Our project has been supported by the Fondation Pierre Fabre, which believes in our approach and that our concept could be used in Africa, where doctors lack medical imaging devices. They provide financial support and other resources - and the more we have, the faster and more efficiently we can do our work.We are constantly looking for both funding and new profiles to get involved within the community, anyone from developers, to designers, engineers, legal experts, and community managers. We are also working on making our wiki more accessible to English-speaking members. If you have some ideas, tips, or want to share similar work with us - leave a comment or contact us.
Urban vegetable gardens can grow in Thessaloniki entering the primary sector in the city and offering food, but also laying the foundations for the transition to a "green" economy. The ‘City as a resource’ is a proposal to create a network of urban vegetable gardens in the city of Thessaloniki. This project was the outcome of a workshop of the MLA Landscape Architecture School of Architecture of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The concept of the pilot project was to intervene in a residual urban space related to its residents, in a city (municipality) under economic hardship, with no access to infrastructure and funding. After the success of the pilot project which took place in the western part of the city of Thessaloniki (Lachanokipoi district), we decided to cooperate with the Municipality of Thessaloniki and the Department of Urban Environmental Management for the creation of an innovative urban vegetable gardening project in the city center. After mapping all the possible vacant spaces in the city center, the new project finally took place in 2014 at Doxa district, right next to the urban vineyard as a symbolic gesture to the new sustainable lifestyle of the city. The group consists of 10 gardeners, who grow their own vegetables under our supervision and support in a cultivating area of 80 m2  (total area 300 m2).The name of the project ‘Kipos3’ comes from the Greek word “kipos” (garden) which points to the archetypal designed landscape and an aesthetical landscape aspect in the structured urban environment. Our vision is to re-imagine the city through the transformation of abandoned areas, residual spaces within the urban fabric, existing parks in need of renovation and re-design, uncovered terraces and buildings are places that could gain collective use. The city needs its residents. The success of an urban vegetable garden based on collective action depends on its social character and the participatory governance of multi- stakeholders especially the community. Residents cultivate their city!Our team focuses on enriching original and location-specific ideas with data, information and constant interaction between the local community and the public space. We are connected to many like-minded initiatives all over the world such as the French project ‘Kipos qui pousse’ and COST Organization for Urban Allotment Gardens in European Cities.Although the whole process meets several obstacles, such as bureaucracy mainly for technical issues, the reservedness of the neighbors due to the fact that they had previous bad experience with municipal actions, we remain focused on our vision, trying to seek collaboration with the municipality, other local authorities and the neighborhood itself.Our goal for 2017 is to construct a new vegetable garden in the same neighborhood in collaboration with the Municipality of Thessaloniki and create synergies with other like-minded initiatives abroad, learn from experts and adapt best practices grounded in Greek reality. In addition, we are going to preserve precious contacts with artists, architects, and agronomists we have met since the starting points of our project. Who benefits from Kipos3?Residents of Thessaloniki getting activated in order to become catalysts of change in their own neighborhood. Local communities wishing to contribute to social cohesion, participatory governance and upgrading the urban landscape. Everyone who wants to be active and participate in the development and co-formation of vacant public spaces. Students of all educational levels, who gain environmental education and collective knowledge through field visits. Kipos3 has run as an urban gardening project within the framework of the Angelopoulos CGIU Fellowship by Angelopoulos Foundation since 2015. So far, the project has attracted the attention of the local press and several European organizations and research programs.We are reaching out to citizens through a dedicated website and our Facebook page, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.For the participation in the garden activities, no special criteria are required. Everyone is welcome to contribute with his passion and willingness to the garden. Kipos3  is an urban gardening project beyond cultivation of land for food provisioning.The people behind the ideaMy name is Eleftheria Gavriilidou and in my early 30s, I have a degree in Architecture, and I am a post-graduate in the MLA Landscape Architecture School of Architecture of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I work as an architect and I contribute to the ‘Resilient Thessaloniki’ project as a participant of the ‘100 Resilient Cities’ pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. After getting a scholarship as a postgraduate student in 2014, I am in charge of the project ‘Kipos3’ working with many other partners. All these years, I had the chance to enrich my professional and academic experience participating in seminars, workshops, and conferences at national and international level.My partner, Maria Ritou, has a degree in Agriculture, and she is a postgraduate in the MLA Landscape Architecture School of Architecture of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki too. She is in charge of the design activities of Kipos3 whereas I am more concerned in ecological activities of the vegetable garden.Our professional relationship runs on the basis of trust, respect, and mutual understanding. After two years of collaboration, we realize that we have learned many things from each other’s capacities trying to construct a vegetable garden from scratch to approaching municipal and other local stakeholders.Also, we really enjoy this feeling of pleasure and satisfaction when people get motivated by our ideas and share our vision for a sustainable neighborhood/ city. We feel blessed being supported by our families and friends who are involved with fresh ideas and their physical presence in the garden. In what ways are you using a city as a resource? What approaches have worked out well, and what made them succeed? Do you have an idea, suggestion, or a thought? Please leave a comment below.  
In the center of Thessaloniki, Maria and Iordanis have established a spiritual center in order to foster spiritual knowledge, exchange of personal experiences and ideas and philanthropic actions for humanitarian relief of poor families. Knowledge & Inspiration offers space for personal development and collective knowledge. Its main objective is to bring together people with different backgrounds (educational, economic and spiritual) who share an interest in spirituality, self-improvement, and accomplishment through seminars, interaction with community members and substantive contribution to needy people.The initiative consists of 12 core members, most of them in their early thirties and 20 families in the voluntary program of daily food provision. These beneficiaries are active in the program until they overcome poverty, unemployment, and malnutrition.The project does not aim to attract the attention of the press and this is the main reason that Knowledge & Inspiration has no virtual presence on social media and Internet in general. For the past 7 years, the community contributes its best, offering good practices inspiring the good will of residents of Thessaloniki and local businesses who encourage and support its efforts.The people behind the ideaKnowledge & Inspiration is an original idea of Maria Georgiou and her husband, Iordanis (who is no longer alive). The initial idea came 7 years ago, after a spiritual experience while traveling in India and meeting with the Indian guru and philanthropist Sathya Sai Baba. When we returned to Greece,we decided to become volunteers in regular service activities such as giving food to the needy, cooperate with NGOs in order to provide medical services, and other forms of civic volunteerism.Nowadays, Maria focuses on 1) self-improvement and 2) community service with the support of Knowledge & Inspiration community members on the basis of shared identity, commitment and common practice. Maria’s driving motivation is on spiritual level, without making daily plans. All these years, she has discovered abilities that she was not aware of. She and her husband used to live fully in materialism, until the moment they landed in India for first time. “It was a radical transformation from a material to a spiritual life”, she says. It was a miracle that helped both of them overcome personal and objective obstacles in their lives.Knowledge & Inspiration is the work of Maria and her volunteers, who are usually busy with tasks related to the community such as food collection, education, humanitarian relief and collective cohesion. When Maria is not running community projects, she participates in colleagues’ seminars and meditates every day. “It’s my way of living”, she says.Who benefits from Knowledge and Inspiration?Knowledge & Inspiration is an open community without specific target groups. The audience is distributed as follows:1. General population who is interested in self-improvement, accomplishment and belonging to a community.2. Poor families of Thessaloniki coping with economic hardships.3. Fellow tutors of spirituality or therapeutic practitioners for mental or physical healing.Future PlansMaria’s personal goal and vision are to create an “Ashram” in a rural area. The inspiration for choosing the ideal location stems from the need of a place combining adult and children education on human values, a community kitchen, organic farming, connection with nature, spiritual guidance, networking with spiritual teachers and gurus, hospitality for visitors and people in need in the context of volunteerism, community service, healthcare (physical and mental) and humanitarian relief. It is an ambitious idea inspired by Sathya Sai Baba’s philanthropic action connecting in this way spirituality with selfless giving.In Thessaloniki, Maria plans to extend the educational programs including meditation, alternative therapeutic techniques such as Reiki, all of them performed by volunteers except the active classes for self-improvement, guidance for new parents and yoga lessons.
In Pinakates, a small village on Mt. Pelion in Central Greece, two friends have decided to create Village Psy. Our project aims to foster the exchange of knowledge and ideas through an open dialogue and spontaneous experiential expression which gives space for personal development. The main objective of Village Psy is to bring together people who have a common interest in issues related to psychotherapy, personal development, and self-improvement. The whole process goes beyond the format of conferences and seminars in enclosed spaces but integrates elements of the natural environment.There are numerous examples from similar healing events in ancient Greece, such as the Asclepeia showing the importance of nature in healing. Drawing from this inspiration, Village Psy combines experiential workshops, presentations, and parallel events to visitors who are looking to combine their summer holidays with self-development.The people behind the ideaVillage Psy is an original idea of Dimitris Pantelis and Atalandi Apergi. The initial idea came 3 years ago, in a discussion under an old plane tree in the village of Pinakates. The discussion revolved around how psychotherapy connects with nature, and how this connection could be expanded to benefit more people. This idea has since evolved to a vision which connects two pillars: 1) thematic tourism and 2) making the process sustainable, repeatable and stable over time. Atalandi has a degree in Sociology and is a post-graduate in Text & Performance Studies. She has also completed a 4-year specialized post-graduate training diploma in drama therapy, and further enriched her psychotherapeutic training and experience with seminars in various psychiatric structures. As a drama therapist, she has clinical experience with different populations, including drug addicts, immigrants, abused women, psychiatric patients, the elderly and people with learning disabilities. Atalandi is a member of the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP), The British Association of Dramatherapists, the Panhellenic Professional Union of Dramatherapists, a member of the editing team of a thematic magazine dealing with drama therapy and a volunteer for WWF-Hellas.Dimitris studied Economics & Business Administration and has worked for 15 years in the banking and telecommunications sector on public relations, sales, and client service. He then continued with studies in Integrative Counselling & Psychotherapy and training on treatments of multi-cultural communities following natural disasters. Dimitris is a member of the local community council, a member of the Mountaineering Club “Pan” and member of the Hellenic Counselling Society.The project runs on the basis of trust and good chemistry between the two founders. The whole concept has been tested in the past through collaboration in smaller scale projects, such as seminars. Their relationship is based on complementarity and mutualism, not rivalries. Driving motivation by their own inspiration, the two of us develop the project locally, being aware of other seminars and educational activities that take place in different places. However, this is the first attempt to connect psychotherapy with nature, while offering access to knowledge stemming from different schools of therapy.The team focuses on facilitation of organizational work -not coaching in the seminars- something that allows them to retrieve various tools and previous experience. On the course of this collaboration, the two founders discovered abilities that even themselves were not aware of. Dimitris is very business savvy, while Atalandi is more into the arts and very protected from all forms of institutionalization. Although we’re different, we have managed to develop “the same language” and excellent communication, allowing the project to move further.Village Psy is the work of two persons, who are usually busy with other tasks. Atalandi is raising two small children, while Dimitris is preparing for his exams in the Nursing School. During the last months, Village Psy has been occupying nearly half of their everyday lives. Although it is difficult to understand this time commitment, seeing the results allows them to realize that this is a lot of work. According to Atalandi, the whole process entails a risk. “It is amazing how you begin with an idea and in a few days or weeks, you see it taking off. The more  you believe in your vision and the more passionate you are about it, the more you can overcome many personal obstacles”. For Dimitris, this project is important because it allowed him to “trust collaboration again”.Who benefits from Village Psy?The target group of the project includes men and women of 25+ years of age, but there is no restriction in terms of age, gender or background. This audience is distributed as follows:General population who is interested in self-improvement. Fellow psychologists, counselors of mental health or other professionals, who have finished their studies and are looking to come in contact with different approaches in their professional development. All those who would like to continue their training in counseling or psychotherapy and wish to be exposed to different schools of psychotherapy. This includes students who want to specialize in something they do not know, who in 8 days can experience nine different approaches in order to arrive at what is the most compatible with their own interests. The ideal place for Village PsyBeyond the personal connection with the village of Pinakates, the inspiration for choosing the location stemmed from the need of a place where people can stay together, ensuring continuity, contact and sharing throughout the process. At Village Psy, everything is done in a community, and that is the importance of the word “Village”.In this context, we are collaborating with local hostels and restaurants and the village’s Cultural Association. Other collaborations involve graphic designers and web developers, although all content is generated by them.At present, the main objective is to get Village Psy established, attracting more and more people in its sessions. However, there are ambitious ideas for similar activities related to alternative and holistic therapy, running in parallel in the surrounding villages, but also the creation of other such respective villages in other areas, so that they can work and connect together. This would allow Village Psy escape its physical boundaries and work towards the creation of a platform for the generation and diffusion of knowledge, always connecting therapy with the landscape and the natural environment. Towards concept validationFor this first year (2016) the project runs on experimental mode, under the auspices of Kondyli Publishers (www.kondyli.gr). This is a thematic publisher, owned by Dimitris, which specializes on issues relevant to psychotherapy. There are thoughts to change the legal entity behind Village Psy, and establish a new one, once the concept is tested and running in a way that is sustainable.Our project has attracted the attention of the press, with many media publishing press releases, interviews or articles. At the same time, a dedicated website (www.village-psy.gr) and Facebook page (www.facebook.com/villagepsy) includes all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.The first session of Village Psy has taken place between 18-28 August in Pinakates, under the theme “Centaur Chiron: Myth - Trauma - Therapy”. The title pays tribute to the mythological figure who roamed the Mountains of Pelion, where Pinakates is located. This first trial offered opportunities for receiving feedback from participants, aiming to improve the process in following sessions. And it resulted in both creation of a very strong community, but also ideas and solutions beyond our imagination. Are you developing different ways of approaching mental health and therapy yourself? Are there things around this topic you'd like to discuss with us, share, ask about, criticize? Let us know in a comment below the post.  
I grew up in Palo Alto and graduated from Gunn High School in 2008. When I was 15, I was accepted into the Palo Alto Police Department’s first student police academy and then became police explorer upon graduation. Over the next 6 years I volunteered with the Palo Alto police department in a many capacities. Through hundreds of hours of riding along with the police I got a deep understanding of law enforcement infrastructure. I saw numerous people challenged by homelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse who were caught in the revolving door of the criminal justice/emergency medical system. A year after aging out of the explorers program I lost a former high school friend to suicide.When I was 23 I did a ride along with ‘CAHOOTS,’ (crisis assistance helping out on the streets) an organization that does civilian crisis response in Eugene, OR. CAHOOTS provides special care to people who are stuck in the revolving door and through its intervention, break the cycle. CAHOOTS provides alternatives to incarceration and hospitalization for people with wellness issues. This ride along catalyzed me and my buddy Doug creating  ‘Concrn’ a company that builds mobile apps and software to assist compassionate response communications infrastructure. We are now a compassionate social service network that connects people in need to responders trained in crisis de-escalation. We offer an alternative to 911 for non-violent crises and respond using the harm reduction model. Concerned citizens can download our mobile app on iPhone or Android or call us directly to access our services. We make it easy for both witnesses and victims of nonviolent crises to create a report and directly dispatch our network.We believe that this “Compassionate Response” model is more humane, harm-reducing, and cost-effective than a law enforcement approach to non-violent crises. Our coordinated teams of responders help connect individuals challenged by homelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse, to the resources they need. These resources include local mental health, physical health, and shelter services. In addition, our ongoing case management program encourages clients to maintain their connection to these support services by promoting clients’ sense of self-worth through alternative methods like art and music collaboration.
Despite an image of desperate, crumbling Greece that some people might have nowadays, those who investigate alternative economies and societies, those interested in self-organisation and changing the status quo recognize the country’s revolutionary role. One of the finest examples is SC!FY, a young organization based in Athens which in the course of four years managed to get a lot of stuff done. My brother, George (Giannakopoulos) has been an Artificial Intelligence researcher who has worked both in Greece and the North of Italy for quite a few years and has had programming and IT consulting experience for over 15 years in the industry. He has been collaborating with researchers from both sides of the Atlantic. What he was experiencing as a researcher, was beyond his imagination. He puts it nicely:"EU is spending billions of euros in research projects. Consortia of research institutes and big EU companies receive huge amounts of money to produce amazing technologies. Technologies that need only a few months of work to become great, potentially life­changing products. But most of them remain unused for years within the walls of the institutes that produce them. It seems absurd, but rarely does anyone undertake the little work that is required to bring top notch scientific results to our everyday lives. It is also common that researchers simply cannot grasp the direct impact a technology they create can have on everyday life, if applied in a friendly, accessible way."He wanted to see it change - and so in 2012 he founded an organisation with a mission to publish and transform that knowledge into ready to use solutions. He could not take it any longer. So, he and his cordial friend Vassilis (Salapatas) decided to bridge this gap between research and society. In 2012 they formed SciFY (Science For You), an Not for profit organization that does exactly this: take scientific results, and then form a community of entrepreneurs, volunteers, researchers and end users to build useful final products to solve everyday problems. And they offer them for free. To all.For the first two years we strategically decided to prove that we are serious about what we do, we are able to deliver and … that we are not crooks (since trust towards NGOs has been very low in Greece after some scandals)We also had to prove we are using freely available results (these are more and more common in EU, which requires many of the research it funds to publish their findings on the most open licenses possible). In the last 2,5 years, we’ve started looking for funding and this is when plenty of things got done. We have been awarded by the President of the Hellenic Republic, we’ve built collaborations with most of the major Greek institutions - foundations, institutes, universities etc. We have a feeling that our impact is rather disproportionate compared to our size ;) But we really think this happens thanks to our focus on communities and our passion for getting things done. You can read about our work in our annual report for 2015. The model that we’ve introduced to our work is to create communities around each of the ideas from the very beginning. We’re also often asked to solve a particular problem by the very communities. This is one of the keys to our success - we’re surrounded by people who want to see and use the results of our work. And they’re actively taking part in the process. It helps us create a space where ideas, needs, opinions circulate and are being taken into account. SC!FY is working now in four domains - areas of interest.The first area of interest is care-related and it focuses on creating assistive technologies for people with disabilities, and on offering them for free (and under open source licences). Among these are games for blind children, which have been developed in collaboration with schools for the blind - they helped us design them, tested and now use them. The process allowed us to bring together blind and non-blind people to work together. These games have more than 3,500 downloads from all around the world, got much media attention - and we constantly get positive feedback from people using them. So we continue developing more games for the bind. :-)We’ve also created a smartphone app called ICSee for people with low vision that applies special filters to the video captured by the phone’s camera and allows users to read a restaurant menu or signs on the door. It’s also available for free and under open source licences on Google Play.. We’re finishing the development of Talk and Play, a platform for people with motor disabilities, that will kick-off in late September. This application will help people who can’t move or talk to communicate with their environment, watch videos, listen to music, or play games that support their rehabilitation. We have created more solutions in this area, that you can find here.The second area of our work is e- democracy. In this strand, we’ve built an open source platform DemocracIT that supports the process of public consultation, which is theoretically common in Greece, but tedious in reality. We’ve tested it and presented to the governmental bodies. Besides, there is also ActiveCommons platform, which we’ve designed to foster collaboration for the common good between It caters organisations, NGOs and groups of people who want to change something and need an effective tool for collaboration. The third scope of our work is supporting civil society with our IT skills. One of the results of such collaborations is a volunteer management platform - available for free, as well. And finally, the fourth pillar of our work is the Artificial Intelligence business. One of the outcomes of our work is NewSum that produces automated news summaries, and works in many languages. Or PServer application, that helps you personalise other applications.  How do you cope with finding financing outside your own country? Do you struggle building or managing communities that could support your work and contribute towards making it time and cost effective?

Je ne suis pas de la génération Y, je ne suis pas vraiment encore un vieux de la vieille quoi que…Je ne suis ni scientifique, ni sociologue mais j’observe le monde tel qu’il est et dès que c’est possible, j’essaye d’en être acteur.Je ne suis pas vraiment spécialiste dans un domaine particulier. Tout au plus un bon généraliste. Ce que je fais bien c’est mettre en contact, créer du lien, amener de la bienveillance sur les environnements dans lesquels je viens essayer de créer de la valeur. Certain dirait que j’amène de la résilience.Il n'y a pas si longtemps, j'ai du réfléchir à ce que je mettrais sur ma carte de visite. J’y ai finalement associé 2 idées et j’ai écrit lean & stereo entrepreneur/facilitateur. En effet, après avoir bourlingué déjà depuis quasiment 10 ans dans un secteur qui était l’économie sociale, qui est devenu l’entreprenariat social et qui ne cesse de s’hybrider pour répondre à la demande de marchés qui n’intéressent pas le privé, qui ne sont pas assez gros pour le public. Un 1/3 secteurs qui a souvent une origine grassroot.Le témoignage que j’aimerais apporter est celui de ces acteurs de première ligne pour qui le monde tel qu’il est sont tant d’opportunité de se réaliser en tant qu’individu et qui cherchent aujourd’hui humblement à être acteur de changement d'un temps où tout s’accélère.Les valeurs que je porte et que j’ai essayé de synthétiser dans l’énoncé d’une fonction sur une carte de visite sont celles d’acteurs agiles. Lean signifie que l’on passe par des itérations avant d’inventer un plan très complet et de se projeter dans l’établissement de toute une stratégie. La notion de stéréo revient pas mal à la mode avec toutes les avancées faites dans le monde de la captation 3D. La Réalité Virtuelle (la VR) comporte pas mal de facettes dont la stéréoscopie existe depuis la création de l’ère cinématographique.Pour en revenir au sujet Change Care, j’avais toujours eu le sentiment d’être capable de faire bouger des choses dans ma réalité. Le challenge était de voir si je pouvais changer d’échelle et amener ce changement à une plus large mesure dans mon environnement. Il y a une bonne année maintenant les choses se sont mises en place et j’ai pu me libérer de la contrainte de travailler pour un projet,  pour un boss, ou pour une structure. Je travaille aujourd’hui à trouver des projets dans lesquels je trouve des leviers pour valider des hypothèses tout en apportant de la valeur intrinsèque aux porteurs de ces projets.Mon approche est assez simple, les hypothèses que je souhaite valider sont toujours plus ou moins du même ordre. En tant que citoyen et acteur de terrain, suis-je capable de décrire et d’amorcer suffisamment un projet pour en faire un sujet lisible pour un environnement qui se situerait à la croisée des 3 secteurs que sont: le Secteur Privé (SP), les Pouvoirs Publics et le Monde Philanthropique (MP)Aujourd’hui ce que je pensais possible, ce dont j’ai longtemps cherché à me libérer: "la contrainte de faire pour", me semble accessible et j’aimerais que d’autres puisse trouver cet espace d’expression. Je travaille à rendre cet état de fait et cet état d’esprit visible chaque jour. Aujourd’hui je peux faire avec, je peux choisir les missions dans lequel je souhaite investir du temps et surtout j'ai trouvé un équilibre, certes fragile, mais qui me permet de me dire que tout mon temps, je le concentre à faire le Monde tel que je l'imagine.Je ne vous raconte pas l’histoire d’un gars qui quitte son boulot parce qu’il est en burn out ou bien le parcours d’un type qui n’en peut plus de sa vie dans le secteur privé. Je ne vais pas non plus narrer l’histoire d’un travailleur social épuisé par une logique institutionnelle et administrative pesante. Qui, jours après jours, limite et anéanti la capacité d’actions possibles d'acteur de première ligne, fatigués de résoudre les problèmes du quotidien tout en luttant pour faire reconnaitre l’essence même de l’action sociale. Faire sens.Il s’agit ici de livrer le  témoignage d’un d'entre deux, d’un acteur capable de passer d’un coté à l’autre du miroir. De passer du privé au public juste pour donner sens à sa quête.L’expérience de travail et la séquence professionnelle que j’aimerais partager prend place à l’époque où je travaillais chez un courtier spécialisé en assurance construction. J’y gérais les dossiers clients. Nous travaillions dans un régime de 40 heures par semaine et j’avais donc droit à un jour de congé supplémentaire par mois. Ce qui m’en faisait 12 au total sur l’année.Ce boulot de courtier était clairement en dehors de ma zone de réflexion mais permettait une vrai stabilité et une bascule vers le secteur privé qui allait affirmer une capacité à faire ce switch associatif/privé que je trouve intéressant dans mon profil.12 jours donc soit à prendre en congés, soit à investir dans quelque chose qui faisait du sens. J’ai donc eu l’opportunité de participer à la première édition en Belgique du Programme Impact de Ashoka (www.belgium.ashoka.org/programme-impact). Je suis devenu coach d’un projet qui était déjà présent en France, en Espagne en Irlande. Le Groupe Associatif Siel Bleu (www.sielbleu.org) est une organisation qui propose de l’Activité Physique Adaptée (APA) aux seniors. Et le projet que j’accompagnais s’appelait Gymsana (www.gymsana.be) en Belgique.Nous avons eu la chance d’être lauréat du Programme Impact en 2013. L’enjeu du programme était de faire changer d’échelle les 12 projets inscrits au travers d’un programme de 3 mois.Ma mission était vraiment axée sur la mise en place de process de travail visant à fluidifier l’activité sur le territoire belge. Le modèle était un copié/collé du mode de développement pratiqué en France par les intervenant en APA. Au niveau de l’encadrement des activités, Siel Bleu disposait d’un matériel pédagogique et de formation très riche qui était mis à notre disposition. Par contre la difficulté en Belgique venait des sources plurielles de financements et de la complexité à les articuler dans un budget cohérent sur les 3 régions du pays.Siel Bleu s’est fait remarqué et est devenu Fellow d’Ashoka grâce à sa capacité à proposer une mesure de l’impact des activités que les intervenants proposaient. Je découvrais la notation de Social Return On Investment (SROI) et la capacité motrice et d’inspiration des Fellow, sorte d’ambassadeurs du changement capable de storyteller leur histoire et de provoquer l’adhésion des parties prenantes du projet. Cette validation scientifique a très tôt été le point fort de Siel Bleu et les APA on très vite convaincu les instances européennes ainsi que le commissaire français Michel Barnier. Le Groupe a connu une forte croissance et a, petit a petit, acquis le respect grâce à sa capacité de proposer une alternative en terme de rupture avec les standards actuels de prise en charge des personnes âgées. Principalement pour la maladie d’Alzheimer et de Parkinson. Mais également pour les diabètes de type 2.Dans mon parcours plutôt riche, j’ai appris aux Petits Riens (www.petitsriens.be), un asbl belge qui lutte contre la pauvreté et l’exclusion qu’on pouvait revaloriser la seconde main pour créer de l’activité économique et financer des actions sociales. Chez Gymsana, j’ai mieux compris comment on construisait un discours et des outils pour impacter un secteur et proposer des solutions innovantes et disruptives par rapport aux standards existants.Durant la phase de transition qui s’installe et qui aura pour horizon une période de 20-30 ans, j’aurai eu l’occasion d’assister, je le pense, à la mutation d'un monde associatif partant d’initiatives locales grassroot, vers des entreprises d’insertion à la recherche d’un modèle de financement le moins dépendant des pouvoirs publics, l’économie sociale. J’ai ensuite vu ce secteur évoluer lorsque sont apparus des entrepreneurs sociaux qu’on appelle aujourd’hui des ChangeMakers. Ils sont capables de mesurer l’impact des efforts qu’ils produisent sur les sujets auxquels ils s’intéressent avec des propositions de valeur toujours plus innovantes. Et aujourd’hui je suis impliqué dans un mouvement qui sera peut être un Makestorming en 2017 au sein d’un Réseau Bruxellois de FabLabs (RBF) qui pense pouvoir se réapproprier des capacités de changements à l’aide de l’assistance numérique qu’elle soit Soft ou Hardware. L’OpenSource nourrit l’espoir de voir les individus s’associer pour FAIRE. Faire communauté, faire sens, faire savoir, savoir faire.Si un changement de paradigme est possible c’est parce que des individus se sont mis en chemin. Cette transition est rendue plus fluide aujourd’hui grâce à l’information distribuée et à des initiatives qui tendent à libérer l’innovation pour Le Commun. Les licences propriétaires qui créaient jusqu’ici de la valeur non pas pour le bien commun mais principalement pour l’intérêt privé volent en éclat. Aujourd’hui une génération s’organise, fait mouvement afin de rendre possible la création de biens communs entre pairs. Michel Bauwens, un belge, peut certainement être reconnu comme un théoricien de ce mouvement d’émancipation du modèle actuel. Et les FabLabs comme les BioHackerspace et autres tiers-lieux sont surement les lieux où les Makers accèdent aux outils capables de faire bouger les lignes.Cette histoire est disponible aussi en anglais.
The beginning is quite weird ­ it's usually like that. In another life I’m an artist, and in that life, a decade ago, I have set up Collectif MANIFESTEMENT.The group’s unique goal is to organize a demonstration once a year and go to the streets with a theme. The matter is usually peculiar, weird or unexpected, and we spend a year, or even longer, preparing the different aspects of the protest.So, in 2010 we settled upon a subject that addressed the homeless people in Brussels. We did it without them, but for them ­ and invited them to join us. It was the first time we came to know some of this population, and the more discovered and understood about them, the more stories and testimonies we collected about their lives, the less sense it made to just wrap everything up and move on to something new.One of the follow­ups of this process was a book, in which we gathered and edited short stories from homeless people we’ve met. It was published in both Flemish and French, and it made many institutions hate us, as many people in that book frankly complained about their work.Ok, we have a bright and pretty broad vision of affairs. Now, what? We had to propose something, and the more I thought of it, the bigger it became in my head. It was overwhelming and ambitions, and I felt I can’t start. That was until I met a woman, who happened to be my former student from the French classes I teach. She was a perfect partner: Flemish, woman, and a businesswoman on top of it. Together we framed the project and made it ripe for implementation in early 2012.It started as a nonprofit in May 2012, but we still took a year to outline some of the details and propose a solid program. It remained complex and ambitious ­ and it’s important to keep it that way. The organization managed to raise money from private sources to buy and renovate a building in Brussels (in fact we are still short of renovation money, and we are looking for 500.000 to get the job done). The space is so huge (650 square meters) that we can both offer support to many homeless people and invite other organizations working on the topic to use it. There is another reason why we made it so big ­ if the place was small and crowded with homeless from, say, Morocco, a Belgian single homeless person wouldn’t enter, even if we offered what they needed. It would just feel overwhelming.The mission of DoucheFLUX is to promote self­-esteem and help homeless people regain a positive image of themselves. The activities we propose do not make them feel intimidated. We forbade the usage of the words such as "culture" or "art" in the space, as well. Together with these precarious people, we produce a magazine, that is published 4­5 times a year. We also release a monthly broadcast, organize meetings in schools and film debates. Recently, we’ve been busy designing a board game that allows regular people to understand and experience the hardships and challenges of homelessness. The idea wasn’t mine ­ one of the homeless people proposed it as a way to engage with passers­by. We are preparing the beta version to be ready for the Brussels Game Festival. After the opening of the building, which should happen by the end of the year, we will finally extend our services beyond going to the streets and establishing relations with the homeless. We will have 20 showers ­ 7 for women, 12 for men, and one for people on wheelchair. There will be also medical area and daily medical staff which our guests can appoint. This simple thing will hopefully fix once and for all the problem with access to showers in Brussels. We’re in the capital of Europe, but for people on the street there is only La Fontaine, which provides one shower per person a week, and you even have to be lucky to get it.Obviously, if we have showers, we need to have laundry. And the lockers. A huge problem among this community: there are virtually no lockers in Brussels, therefore people constantly get robbed and lose their things. As a result, they end up in a vicious circle of bureaucracy to get back whatever papers and permissions they need, and incredible insecurity. We will have 400 lockers, from super small for medicine and documents, to bigger ones.And finally, we would like to open a help desk at DoucheFlux one day. Which means we don’t want to become the only organization covering all their needs ­ but to provide them with information on where they could be offered help with other problems. We want this to be accompanied by the first centralized website, simple and intuitive so that people who don’t speak French or Flemish will be able to navigate it. It’s incredible how untransparent Brussels is to these people ­ they have no idea where to find a lawyer, where to sleep, eat, get their medicine or find work. This idea is supported by everyone from the field in the city.We are also facing some challenges around financing (we think we have reached the limits of private donations in the country at this point) and we consider turning the space into a public-­private entity. Our bargaining chip is all our achievement ­ we hope the formal institutions will see it as a necessity to support an initiative that has gone so far on its own. We have 50 volunteers, we employ and pay only one person (we want to extend it to at least 2­3), and all that without a single euro from the state. I’m optimistic about it ­ I don’t think anyone would like to see us closed at that point.Would you like to share you experience with work with vulnerable social groups? What are the hardships, common misconceptions, institutional obstacles you find exceptionally striking? What is your strategy to engage with these groups and help them overcome mistrust and lack of confidence?
I'm not part of Generation Y. I'm not part of the older generation either.I am neither a scientist nor a sociologist but I observe the world as it is and I try to have an impact in it.I am not really a specialist in any particular field. At most, I am a good generalist. What I do is connecting the dots, creating links, bringing well-being in environments in which I try to create value. Some would say I bring resilience.Not so long ago I had to decide what to put on my business card. I finally combined two ideas, so I wrote Lean & stereo contractor/facilitator. Indeed, I had knocked for almost 10 years on the door of the social economy, which has become social entrepreneurship and which continues to mutate to meet the demands of markets that do not raise the interest of the private sector but that are neither big enough for the public. The third which often has grassroot origins.The testimony I would like to make is that of front-line actors for whom the world is full of opportunities and who humbly seek to be an actor of change at a time when everything is accelerating.The values ​​that I carry and tried to synthesize in my business card are those of agile actors. Lean means going through iterations before setting-up a comprehensive plan and establishing a strategy. The concept of stereo relates to the progress made in the world of 3D capture. Virtual Reality (VR) has a lot of facets including stereoscopy, which has existed since the film era.Back to Care Change, I have always had the feeling of being able to change the things surrounding me. The challenge is to see if I could scale-up and bring this change to a larger environment. It has been a year now since I have been able to free myself from the stress of working on a project, for a boss and a structure. I work today to find projects in which I have the leverage to validate assumptions while bringing intrinsic value to the holders of such projects.My approach is pretty simple. The assumptions I want to validate are always more or less similar. As a citizen and practitioner I am able to describe and initiate a project to make it readable for an environment at the crossroads of 3 areas: the Private Sector (PS), the Powers public and the World Philanthropy (MP)Today what I thought was possible, what I long sought to free myself from -the stress- seems accessible, so I want others to find their space of expression. I work to make this state of mind possible every day. Today I can choose the missions in which I want to invest time, so I have found a balance, albeit fragile, that allows me to concentrate in making the World as I imagined.I am not telling the story of a guy who left his job because he was burnt out or the story of a guy who had enough of his life in the private sector. I will not tell the story of the social worker exhausted by a heavy administrative and institutional burden. The story of a guy who, day after day, limited the capacity of the frontline actor tired of solving everyday problems and not recognizing that it was social action fueling those resources. Make sense.This is to deliver the testimony of a player who can move from one side of the mirror to the other. Who moves from the private to the public just to give meaning to his quest.The work experience and job sequence that I want to share takes place in the days when I worked with a broker specialized in construction insurance. I was managing customer records. We worked 40 hours a week but had the right to an extra day off per month. Which made a total of 12 days per year.This broker job was clearly outside my reflection area but allowed a true stability and switch to the private sector.12 days to take a leave or to invest in something that made sense. So I had the opportunity to participate in the first edition of the Belgian Ashoka Impact Program (www.belgium.ashoka.org/programme-impact). I became the coach of a project that was already present in France, Spain and Ireland. The Associative Group Siel Bleu (www.sielbleu.org) is an organization that offers Adapted Physical Activity (APA) to seniors. The project I was in charge of was called Gymsana in Belgium (www.gymsana.be).We were the winners of the Impact Programme 2013. The aim of the program was to change the scale of 12 projects through a program of 3 months.My mission was focused on the working process to streamline the activities of this programme in Belgium. The model copy/pasted the mode of development practiced in France in other APAs. Siel Bleu had teaching and training materials available to us. But the difficulties in Belgium came from plural sources of funding and the complexity to articulate a coherent budget in the 3 regions of the country.Siel Bleu made its mark and became an Ashoka Fellow thanks to its ability to offer measurable impact of the activities that stakeholders were proposing. I discovered the rating of Social Return on Investment (SROI) and the inspiration of Fellows, who were ambassadors for change and storytellers capable to trigger the adhesion of other stakeholders to the project. This scientific validation early became the highlight of Siel Bleu and APA quickly convinced the European authorities and the French commissioner Michel Barnier. The Group has experienced a strong growth and has little by little gained respect thanks to its ability to offer an alternative to current standards of care of the elderly. Mainly for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's. But also for type 2 diabetes.Throughout my rather rich career, I learned in Les Petits Riens (www.petitsriens.be), a Belgian non-profit organization that fights against poverty and exclusion by providing value to second hand goods in order to create economic activity and finance social actions. At Gymsana I understood how to build speeches and tools for impact and offer innovative and disruptive solutions over existing standards.During the transition phase which settles and throughout a period of 20-30 years, I will have the opportunity to witness the transfer of an associative model starting at local grassroot initiatives, towards integration companies in search of a model less dependent on public funding: the social economy. I have seen the sector evolve with the emergence of social entrepreneurs now called ChangeMakers. They are capable of measuring the impact of efforts on topics of interest with value propositions ever more innovative. And today I am involved in a project that may be a Makestorming in 2017, a Brussels FabLabs Network (RBF) which aims to reclaim capacity changes with digital support, either Soft or Hardware. The OpenSource nourishes the hope of individuals to associate and MAKE. Make community, make sense, know how.If a paradigm shift is possible is because individuals set the path. This transition is more fluid today thanks to the flux of information and initiatives that tend to liberate innovation for the Common. Propriety licenses, which hitherto created value not for the common good but primarily for the private interest, shatter today. A generation now organizes to make the creation of common property among peers possible. Michel Bauwens, a Belgian citizen, may certainly be recognized as a theorist of this movement for the emancipation of the current model. And FabLabs like BioHackerspace are probably places where ChangeMakers have access to the tools that move the lines.
When discussing society’s biggest questions I like to have a discussion with Ginette Bauwens, a figure of the activist scene in Brussels and well-spoken about any subject. She has the looks of a friendly grandmother but the vivacity and energy of a young activist that believes in the power of humans. She played an active role in the recent car free shift of the centre of Brussels but made sure it didn’t become a gentrified zone. She majored in philosophy and made the choice to work all her live half time so she could invest her time in local or global movements.First when I asked her to give a short opinion about the bottom up imitatives organizing care related projects she responded: I only believe people can give care when it comes from love and friendship. All other forms need to be done by the government to be effective. I was really surprised by this ballsy argument so I invited over for a drink on the hottest day of the year (35°C!) and we had a tomato juice and a great conversation.We dived immediately into the subject. Care is a government issue for  her that isn’t at all taken care (pun intended) of. Why does the government give as much power to the pharmaceutical industry for example? Why can Nestlé become the number one partner of a government organization called ‘Kind En Gezin’ that helps parents of new-born through the first year? For her our role as activist and change makers is to put pressure on the government to make change on a big scale possible.I explain her how local initiatives are bending the system like the open insulin, chemotherapy in Romania or ways that people are hacking neuroprosthetis. Even if she find them great initiative she is scared that it will not be scalable, for her if the government doesn’t follow, nothing will change on the long term. I ask her why even within this idea people are rather trying to find solutions themselves then going in the street and pressuring the government. It makes sense, she says, you have an illusion doing something more meaningful while starting a project, then putting pressure on a government where the reward will (maybe) be given after many years. Instant gratification is much more popular, and with bureaucratic complexification people are less temped to get into a long battle with the government.But Ginette isn’t the person to only be sceptic and give critic towards ideas. She likes finding solutions. So before I explain her the principle of the workshop we talk a bit further on the big problems ahead. For her everything can be put into three categories: poverty, elderly care and work ethics. Poverty makes it impossible to take care of each other; it is a vicious circle that is difficult to get out of. Even with the best projects, people without money will not get towards it. Elderly care is also a big problem in European countries, care became profit and it is all about efficiency. Only a rearrangement about how we look at elderly care can get us out of this problem. Finally there is the way we look at work and how it makes us sick: burn out is one of the biggest epidemics of this century and involves pulls the whole family downwards. Not one political party is discussing these problems on a larger scale and that is problematic for her. The resources are there, but the unwillingness of changing is bigger. Politicians aren’t trained to be vectors of change; they are the ones that bring continuity. It’s the civilians that need to push the change and politics to implement it.Dark times ahead? Maybe, but this discussion made me think more clearly about the workshop and what we need to take notice of when bringing care-project together. Like within the makers movement it is important to find a balance between corporate and counter culture partners, within care it is also important to have an open approach towards policy makers. Yes we are in a ruff path at the moment, and trust is at an all time low towards politicians. But therefor it is the moment to open our arms to welcome them towards new ways of organizing care. We need much more and easier collaboration between projects. We need especially that knowledge of the government to tackle complex problems with multiple partners. We need to take them by the hand and show them what there is possible within an open care systemThe discussion I want to open towards the community is: Is involving the policy makers important, or will it be obsolete in the future? What kind of dialogue can care taking projects take towards it?
For the past few years I’ve been busy rethinking the way healthcare is delivered to patients and how health communication and prevention are being constructed as information for the benefit of the public. Being an adjunct professor lecturing Sociology of health at the University of Parma I have a good starting point - not exactly a healthcare expert person, but a sociologist with a huge passion for e-learning and innovation in education, working on the change from within.My idea is that the change should take place in the training and education sphere about how professionals and practitioners become such. Innovation and openness of knowledge must become the cutting edge paradigm within universities, hospitals and healthcare policies. I’ve been granted research scholarships for the past years and I use them to bring change in two main areas of education: technologies and practices of innovation. It’s about bringing these two aspects, also existing in collaborative economies, communities, in hacker groups and activists promoting open access to knowledge, data and technology to stubborn, hermetic ecosystems of higher education.  My current project, a weblab named Puntozero (http://puntozero.github.io/), explores the ways in which teachers, professors, tutors and students -used to the traditional model of lecturing a class and equipping people with theoretical knowledge and in-field training- might integrate in a community of practice to innovate the way of learning. This year there are about 150 students involved. The brainstorming about proposals include more talking to the patients, who want to collaborate and surely want to see medicine more friendly, more efficient, more human. It is important to change the way we see health care - not as a prestigious, restricted profession for a selected group of professional, but as a practice that has been there for thousands of years, a huge amount of collective wisdom that pioneered and support what we call medicine and care right now.  It’s fascinating to play with the idea of a healthcare student classroom where, instead of feeding people with theories, teachers would create space where students meet makers of all sorts and discuss various technological innovations with them, and spend time with their patients, getting hands on experience in various cases. By encouraging sharing of data, more interdisciplinary collaboration, creativity and networking educational institutions could create a new breed of health professionals. Their work style would be more inclusive and horizontal, and they would be more interested in critical thinking and discussion, sharing and transparency.  At the moment I’m working with a couple of small innovations that could lead to improved communication between health professionals and patients. One of them is about involving three trainees in archiving and developing a set of health-related caremojis, accessible in a open, less formal exchange, a tool improving communication and adoption of symbols to represent concepts of concern (e.g.: surgery tools, health conditions, symptoms, etc..). They will be soon ready to be used and evaluated by the students.  Another one is to replace yearly reports from traineeship by an online book, accessible to everyone and encouraging discussion. And it actually did. While i was working as professor I also skipped preparing tests and asked each pupil to come up with one multiple choice question, and out of 150 of them, were chosen random 20 questions set that became the test I made an exam. It was a very democratic, surprising step for students. I tend to be also available online for my students as much as possibile and I put a lot of stress on digital learning and Open Educational Resources (OER) - to save paper, to spare their pockets, to promote more openness, to bring more p2p learning. Finally, I try to skip the usage of huge, expensive books in the classrooms - instead, I look for good, open source materials, and if they’re in English, I ask my students to translate one page each and put it up in Italian as a wiki, available to everyone. There are all these ways in which students are forced to meet and talk, an essential practice, widely absent in the formal education.  I’m interested in joining the OPENandchange with the mission of tweaking and/or revolutionizing the classroom and the health care education and training. I want to create more opportunities for students to meet people who change the way care is given in different ways - by making devices, by creating informal institutions, in fablabs and elderly houses. I want to prepare workshops where makers and patients would be working along the health care providers on new solutions. And I want to empower alternative ways of giving care, outside of the formal profession, initiatives driven by values other than money - by the idea of being helpful, virtue of serving each other, and actual engagement.  Therefore i would like to engage other scholars, makers, educators, archivists, patients and who else inspired by an open paradigm of healthcare in contributing to a p2p learning project to advance healthcare professions curricula and innovate where possibile and to open knowledge filed the higher education for healthcare professions. Please add your comment to participate.
The United Nations think that health care is the nub to development, and the forerunner to any of the other Sustainable Development Goals; that is for a country, or a continent...or Africa to develop strongly, there must be sound healthcare system first. I think that there are many suffering in Africa because of the unaffordable, inaccessible, and inadequate health care system, and I think that in order to keep the tolls of death low, perhaps people don’t need to wait for a revolution to the health sector, maybe what we need is an easily accessible, and affordable health alternative. Because of the many polluted rivers, African children die daily from diarrhea. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that 2,195 children die EACH DAY from diarrhea. Due to the unaffordable health care system, many diabetic sufferers die without receiving proper medication or medical attention. Hence, many African countries like my country, Nigeria, have one of the highest diabetic sufferers and deaths.My name is Ivan Ezeigbo. I am 20 years old, and currently a sophomore at Minerva Schools at KGI, California, USA. I was inspired by Monica Marcu’s book, The Miracle Tree, to research with a team back in Nigeria on the blood regulatory power of the contents of the leaves of a very medicinal plant. It is a herbal plant that has just drawn a lot of attention in its potential to cure over three hundred ailments. This is the Moringa Oleifera. We experimented on Wistar albino rats. The idea was to inject alloxan intraperitoneally to all groups of Wistar albino rats with healthy working pancreas (alloxan increases blood sugar level, thus inducing hyperglycaemia or making them “pseudo-diabetic”). The bioactive agents of moringa leaves were extracted with ethanol and water, and two groups of the rats were treated each with these contents. An additional group was treated with synthetic insulin (insulin is a natural blood regulatory hormone that brings down blood sugar level), and all three groups were observed. We discovered that the group of Wistar albino rats treated with the bioactive agents of the moringa leaves extracted with water had a SIGNIFICANTLY SIMILAR blood sugar level as those treated with synthetic insulin, and less significant with those treated with ethanol. This unearthened two truths. First, moringa has powerful blood regulatory effects, almost equivalent to the natural insulin. Secondly, water is a better extraction agent than ethanol, unlike the case for many other plant leaves. Aside its blood regulatory power, moringa also cures diarrhea, and many other bacterial and fungal infections. It is also a healthy store for numerous nutrients, vitamins and amino acids. It also thrives very well in these tropical regions of Africa, especially the Southern Nigeria. Armed with this knowledge, I took up the entrepreneurial project of making moringa teas using tea bags because this would not only help a lot of poor people in Nigeria, and Africa in general, who cannot afford or obtain quality health care, but would be a cheap and accessible way of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, since water is a good extraction agent for moringa, moringa teas would provide consumers the maximal health benefits. Even though, I have not had the necessary funding and have been self-funding this project, my motivation to help people live longer and healthier has kept this dream going, and I have not tired out in bringing this to fruition. I am still conducting researches and experiments on my tea, and I have just purchased about two plots of land for moringa farming. I would still need to set up an industry where these teas will be processed.This is good news to diabetic sufferers in Africa; it is good news to poor children and families in Africa who cannot afford quality health care. This is good news to hypertensive patients and the obese. This is good news to Africa. My dream is that this project greatly lowers mortality rate in Africa, and if we are not being too optimistic, perhaps...just perhaps, we may begin to realize stronger development.A link to the paper we published on the experiment with Wistar albino rats: http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.diabetes.20160503.02.html
Excuseme the fowl language, but it’s appropriate here. We all know (or will) the insane cost of them. We spend lots of money on them on the household and institutional budgets. Several times a day we throw away these 30 cents items, often without needing to. Every human will or have used them for years. For multinational corporations they are the sweet smell of money, for us…well it depends. Surely a disaster for the environment. What are we talking about?This is the situation. You are a caring person and you see tears. What’s the problem? Parents know the drill. The usual detection algorithm starts. A check flowchart: pain? hunger? …. or is it the ‘bottom line’?The sweet or not so-sweet smell tells you what you have to do.You will also know about the silent-positive; no alarm and no change leads to a pain in the bottom. We dry the tears and invest in curing the wounds. Soon this leads you to adopt the institutional approach.The institutional approach is to change at specific times, whether needed or not. The vacant slot is usually before feeding and ofthen clean ones goes to pollute our dump-yard. What goes in, must come out and then the sh.t hits the fan. The unscheduled aftermath sometimes goes undetected (silent-positive). This scheme goes for our elderly as well. The poor person is left unchanged. You know what we are talking about here, don’t you? DIAPERS. Those wonderful disposable ones that have released tremendous time resources, given mothers time to breathe, for which, we gladly pay the price. What’s the problem? The issues are 1. many times diapers are changed un-necessarily and 2. many times they are NOT changed at the right moment. First case is a waste of money and environmental resources. Second case is health hazard (especially for the elderly).The theoretical solution is simple: Change when needed.In practice: you can’t go around sniffing there every 20 minutes, especially not as institutional employee.Solution:With cheap modern technology you could easily make a ‘pamper sniffer’ (please be aware of active patents). This 10€ sniffer would signal yellow (a drop of pee is absorbed so it’s not yet urgent) red (the sh.t has hit the fan, change now). Those IOT freaks will upgrade to an app telling the carer: what, who, and the GPS coordinates of the sinner. Critical obstacle:You think Mr. Pumpers will sponsor a 50% reduction of his profit?Opportunity: Someone could get very rich, society will save and environment spared. Personally I would gladly have paid 100€ for a 'pamper sniffer' when my kids were small. I’d happily pay 200€ as a gift for my dad and please go ahead charge my children 1000€ when the time comes where I’m in deep …. (provided the nurse obay the alarm).Bill of materials (draft).

As a global- world citizen I find Switzerland IDEAL for my needs to interact with others around the world. The internet and infrastructure is par excellent and although I dont speak much french or german I still mange to communictae well with others here who pass through this project as most have englsh as their seocnd language. Currently my viewpoint is that decentrlaisation or ism is the way forward for our humanity to go into. It is how we will save this planet from greed-exploitation and most of all ...false prop[aganda! - It is vital for me to work with people who are like minded and pragmatic. ..and who see the way ahead as visionaries..and I came across this project in Month Soleil two years ago...since then I have felt that I am doing something positive to bring in the NEW society. At mont soleil we are trying to create this new culture in the shadow of the old and become a model of what we all would like to see in the age to come. I have been involved in many differnet movemnet and when I discovered the decentralise now! movement which is based on the intelligent understaing and world view which I personally resonate with I am empowered to carry on the struggle. 
I am a member of the Inaugural Class of Minerva Schools at K.G.I., as well as Minerva’s, Mental Health Services Programs Coordinator for Berlin and Buenos Aries. Which sounds great, but seriously, what the heck does that even mean?Minerva is a new university that aims to reimagine the paradigm of higher education, based on the science of learning. All classes are seminars, with a flipped classroom structure. Meaning that we students, learn the content on our own and spend time engaging with the deeper concepts behind the material. Moving the emphasis away from the professor teaching and instead towards students learning.All of this is facilitated by Minerva’s online platform where all classes take place. Every student (no more than 20 per class) webcams into class, where the platform allows our professors to more easily check how much everyone is participating in the discussion, send us into breakout groups, and live poll the class. Beyond being of instructional benefit, the online format takes away much of the typical costs of facilities development and maintenance that traditional universities place upon their students. Additionally, it allows Minerva to be a genuinely international experience. Our student body is comprised of students from over 40 countries. We live and travel together to seven cities (in as many countries) in cohorts no greater than 150 students.  This unique structure has brought together an amazing community, with potential for changing many of the ways we view higher education. However, there is one factor of higher education that I work most with, and that is students’ mental health and wellness! Minerva students’ have necessarily high work loads, a variety of cultures and constantly transitioning lifestyles, which makes it the perfect edge case to gain insights on how to improve mental health care in universities.Accessibility of Resources:In the U.S., a 2014 study found that the average ratio of university mental health professionals to students is about 1:2080. This means that students in need of counseling services face long wait lists and a low amount sessions, resulting in care that is often literally too little too late.This has a simple fix: dedicate resources so that students who seek help can get it! The real challenge comes in getting students to value their own well being and to reach out when they feel they need mental support. 80% of students who commit suicide (the second leading cause of university student death) never come into contact with any staff from the counseling center. How do we address these issues?The answer is Cultivating Care through Community!This is where my work comes in. As a student working on the school’s mental health team I get work on changes that try and address mental health before it becomes an impediment to education. Currently, I am working on a training for students to learn how to better manage their self care and stress management. Additionally, we are adapting trainings from other universities to include aspects from the science of learning, and create a more lasting impact. A prime example of this is the Student Support Network Training (originally developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute), where students are nominated by their peers to learn how to better understand their own mental health, as well as support friends by caring for them in crisis and connecting to the resource they need.In addition, it’s no longer enough to focus solely on the counseling department’s efforts to improve students wellness. Our academic team offers periodic sessions with deans and professors to help students improve their writing, time management and other skills that can lead to increased stressed when not appropriately addressed.The Student Experience Team has created a series of traditions that brings the student body together as well, to fight the isolation that can commonly occur when students transition into college. Every monday evening a different student takes a leap of faith and give their “Minerva Talk”, by sharing the story of their life so far. On Wednesdays students gather in small groups for Supper Clubs where they all bring some food to share as they explore questions that push them to be vulnerable. While we still working on figuring out a lot of how we address student well being (and build this university) it’s become clear that the future of student care must be holistic and not just reactive. I’m curious to hear your thoughts and also what you are working on! Please connect with me or comment below.
My story begins with my daughter Sonia. She was born in 2007 with an extremely rare and complex heart defect. We flew around the world to find a solution for her heart to function as close to normality and we found it. In 2008 in Boston, on the day she was discharged from the hospital with a fixed heart, we discovered she is profoundly deaf. Acquired deafness from the many medical procedures and medication she had for supporting her heart function in her first months of life. Right now she is a perfectly normal 9 years old and her hearing is provided by a cochlear implant. The journey to normality was not over yet. Cochlear implants provide only the access to sound, but the brain needs to get used to decoding the sounds it receives. So going down that tortuous road and understanding how a late diagnosis can make auditory-verbal rehabilitation much harder, I started thinking about solutions for children who are already diagnosed and also for those that will to be born and possibly suffer from congenital hearing loss. In 2013 I started an NGO - Asociatia Sonia Maria, willing to get involved in providing solutions for children with hearing loss and congenital cardiac diseases. I counselled families of children born with congenital complex cardiac diseases in order to access health care abroad. I helped them transfer their children to a cardiac centre in Munich, Germany where their health issues met the needed medical care. Parents reached out to me for advice and support, I helped them contact the clinic and maintain the contact with medical staff abroad. Other times I just I brought medication that was not available in my home country or found a connections in countries where needed medication was available and managed bringing it to Romania. This saved my daughter’s life at birth, and other children further on. At times I flew with families to Germany, discussed with doctors and supported them during the hard times their children underwent complex surgeries. Once we started dealing with hearing loss, it broadened my area of issues that needed to be addressed. In 2015 I opened Casa Koala, the first family centred auditory-verbal centre in Romania, with the help of an Australian speech therapist. Viktorija McDonnel relocated in Bucharest for two months to help us kick start the project. In Romania there is no other rehabilitation centre especially designed for children with hearing loss wearing cochlear implants. We hold individual weekly sessions in the centre and for children living in remote areas we provide tele practice. Children and their families have the opportunity to access this program especially created to help families of deaf children on their road to learning to listen and speak. With a team of three people we try to change the way in which families relate to therapy. We are trying to build a community of people who are informed, counselled and supported on their path to speech rehabilitation.Having access to information and seeing how much harder it is for children to acquire speech when they are diagnosed at a late age, I am making efforts to create a Bill that will implement mandatory neonatal hearing screening in all the maternities in Romania. This will mean that all the children born deaf will be diagnosed at birth and they will have the best chance in receiving the proper medical care, the devices that will give them full access to sounds and further on a fair chance in rehabilitation.
What we doDemonstration of an OpenCare model of a ‘makerspace’, We propose a laboratory where people living with motor impairment due to e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke or spinal cord injury (SCI) can meet and collaborate with other people. There will be mentors (physiotherapists, engineers and designers etc.) and together we will create solutions to personal needs in form of assistive devices. A cooperative model where citizens with various skills can work together on realizing devices for use in everyday life, that will improve or maintain individual functional capabilities. This model will explore ways to transfer research results directly to users (target participants). New and existing ideas will be challenged and transformed into methods and assistive technology for activities of daily living. Initial focus will be to demonstrate how the challenges of mobility can be resolved by helping people's creativity in a social environment. One challenges that people often meet is the need for adaptation of tools to be able to perform day-to-day tasks as .abilities change, In the WeHandU laboratory people will be able (and helped) to implement such changes.More participants = more resultsThe basis of WeHandU is to be volitional participation of people with skills in various aspects of assistive technology. Solutions will vary from realizing simple mechanical aids to involvement of expert researchers. The new infrastructures of makerspaces (also known as fablabs or hackerspaces), allowing the do-it-yourself construction of objects, lend itself as a host for the WeHandU initiative. Here sophisticated devices can be prototyped using advanced machining processes (e.g. 3D printing). A lot of individuals create a personal DIY solutions. Those not marketed or provided by the health service can be manufactured in the WeHandU framework. Likewise subsequent modifications can be easily be implemented as new needs arise. People challenged by MS, stroke and SCI will find help in peers, designers, engineers networking with clinicians as well as people with ‘soft’ skills in the socializing context of a makerspace. One of the concrete challenges to resolve is addressing the problem of dropped foot . With a vast practical experience we can guide people to select, try or even construct their foot drop correcting stimulator. A device that, despite solid proof of efficiency in scientific literature, has not been adopted by the healthcare systems. Another of the most important problems regards the vanishing hand function. Here a recently developed technology comes in. It’s a open source (meaning that all details of how to replicate are publically available) device for strengthening the hand, using FES (mecfes.wikispaces.com). It has been tested clinically for improving hand function in SCI, but there is no contraindications for applying it to people living with MS. Most important of all, this initiative in synergy with OpenCare will challenge the existing healthcare providers to adopt the model and provide a more user centered approach.The WeHandU idea is mainly concerned about preserving autonomy by assistive technology for the hand function and walking using state of the art technological inventions combined with simple do-it-yourself manufacturing techniques in a socially engaging environment. Use of nowadays rapid-prototyping technologies(es. 3d printing), allows to bring creative people together for an effective low-cost collaboration process which brings real and efficient industrial solutions in relatively short time.
Table of contentsLegal tacticsLogic of this documentLegal tacticsDon't incorporateIf you are not a legal entity, you are obviously exempt from any authorization regime, bureaucracy requirements etc. Your scope for action is limited only by the freedom of individuals in your legal system. On the downside, unincorporated initiatives cannot easily use some of the services that legal entity can. They canot hold a bank account, sign a contract, rent an office etc. They rely heavily on the good will of the people who believe in them to maintain coherence, even  more so than incorporated ones. The Helliniko Community Clinic is an example of a very effective care initiative that has decided not to incorporate."Squat, then negotiate"Many care projects need physical spaces, but buildings have an especially top-heavy regulatory regime in many countries. Rather than ask for authorizations, some groups find it easier to start  by illegally squatting their building of choice, then negotiating with the owner. The act of squatting creates a problem for the owner; an agreement with the squatters can be presented as the solution. Belgium (and maybe other countries too?) has a legally attenuated contractual form for people and organisations to temporarily occupy buildings. One of its advantages: industrial spaces or office buildings can be temporarily repurposed as living quarters. Loic is an expert in this area – see here.Logic of this documentStarting with a phrase from woodbine-health-autonomy-center  “This practice may involve working outside the structure of licenses, certifications and insurance. “ To my understanding of OpenCare, then this is the very essence. Breaking out of ‘failed institutions’ https://edgeryders.eu/en/escaping-failed-institutions-through-evasive-entrepreneurship while staying clear of trouble.As @markomanka remind us:  ...it will break.., but let's skip the simple logical stuff to which we all agree (Being ethical correct, Good Clinical Practice, Protect privacy, Helsinki declaration, Risk assessment…) and make some foothpaths in the illogical legal jungle, mapping the traps and dangerous animals. Let’s also stick to EU continent of bureaucratic beasts.Therefore this proposal of creating a living document to collect knowledge, references and safe practice(My initial title suggestion:) OpenCare Legal Evasion Guide or How to keep clear of lawsuitsThere is a start in the 100$ overview https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NKc2bM1FnpQ9zCEveieFr7bIGA9JkI8U_adsBpyma1A/edit#heading=h.5obrk7n45hk3 but I think it would be better with a dedicated collaborative document.Draft for a table of content:* How to get around ensurance of responsibility etc..* Can you reproduce a patent for non profit or private use?

Counter Culture Labs in Oakland is a science-oriented community hackerspace, with a focus on biohacking. In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.Open Insulin is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.Counter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from Sudo Room, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from Biocurious, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.About a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made some suggestions to us about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized a successful crowdfunding campaign, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the 100 Campaign, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.The general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.Right now we’re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can’t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.Provided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of ‘holy grail’ goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.Ultimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body’s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.At the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we’re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we’re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.Meanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it’s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.Do you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you’d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen? Are you working on a diabetes-related solution? Or do you feel like a network of care biohackers is something you’d like to get involved with? Leave a comment and let us know.
I came across and interesting article thought I would share. Rural clinics in Nicaragua, as well as many other countries often lack a constant supply of electricity required for sterilization. Students designed a solar powered device, called Solarclave to combat this issue and promote healthy practices in rural medicine. Using local supplies that can be replaced and repaired by the user and enable heat to be generated well over the required minimum for sterilzaition. Without electricity- The solution: use the sun and creating an efficient and intuitive solar powered device.Read the full article and watch the video: http://www.techxlab.org/solutions/innovations-in-international-health-solarclave-solar-autoclave  
Buoy is a software-based communication tool used for improving community responses to distressing situations that affect one or more community members. It is built from the ground up to provide individuals and community organizations with an alternative to State- and corporate-run emergency response infrastructures, such as making a 112 or 911 phone call in Europe or the Sates. It offers a flexible and customizable, intake, dispatch, and field support toolkit for coordinating collective action in the event of crises, whether large or small.Using a smartphone or laptop computer, a community member can assemble one or more crisis support Teams, alert their support Team(s) of where they are and what they need by pressing a single button, and communicate in real-time with their support Team. Importantly, Team members can also coordinate with one another, independent of any communication from the person in crisis.Buoy is developed by a growing group of anti-capitalist, anti-racist, prison abolitionists calling themselves the Better Angels. We formed in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street protests in the United States, but are more inspired by movements of militant resistance against capitalist and nationalist domination such as the Zapatistas, and Rojavan Kurds abroad, and Black Lives Matter evictions of police occupation domestically.Many people are engaged in parallel efforts to both abolish racist systems of social control such as police and simultaneously supplant them with new systems and structures that genuinely serve a community's needs. As technologists, we recognize that technological advancement amplifies all existing power, which is why we focus technical development efforts to support pre-existing activist and community organization processes, rather than imposing new protocols or procedures. This also means we recognize that Buoy is useless for an individual without a pre-existing social support group, whether that be a Church group, family, or activist collective willing to use the tools together.For this reason, Buoy is built so that it can be easily added to an existing community's social service infrastructure. Rather than embarking on creating new services, caregiving groups can add Buoy as a layer atop their existing websites. So Buoy is not a traditional "app" that users download in the app store, but rather a means of adding crisis response, emergency dispatch, and coordination tools to the repertoire of any organization already providing caregiving support to their membership.Inherent in this design is a decentralized architecture that more closely mirrors the way real-life social networks and grassroots organizations are dispersed. On a technological level, it's also a practical return to the earlier days of the Internet before massive, centralized corporate services dominated the landscape of cyberspace. Nevertheless, Buoy makes use of state of the art mobile technology to provide highly accurate GPS-enabled mapping, live video, and other real-time communication tools that in many cases far exceed the meager capabilities of traditional State-run "First Responder" services. And we do it using strictly free software that adds no additional burden to a group's budget.Experience has demonstrated that there already exist a vast array of functioning alternatives to State-run care giving institutions and crisis response services. Moreover, for the vast majority of issues that people rely on State-run emergency services for, the State's responses do more harm than good. In contrast, community-run services staffed by the friends and peers of people in need provide a quality of care far superior to the level of care provided by similarly-tasked State or corporate employees. This is most obvious in the case of calling 911 in the United States for issues such as "noise disturbances," which too often end in the murder of a marginalized person at the hands of a police officer.Ending such horrors requires, in part, providing ubiquitous access to equally-usable alternatives to existing corporate-State partnerships. Much of this alternative infrastructure already exists in certain areas, in the form of community health clinics and volunteer collectives. But one piece these groups are still missing is the technical "last mile" that connects community members in need with the resources that their community's already-existing volunteer services provide when and where they need it.That's where Buoy fits in.

Where we startedWoodbine is a hub for building autonomy in the wake of a dying culture. Our mission is to expand collective material and organizational capacities in order to build revolution in the 21st century. With a workshop, library, kitchen, and meeting space, we focus on efforts to self-organize, connect, create infrastructures, and develop greater individual and collective efficacy.  The Woodbine Health Autonomy Resource Center is a communal space in the neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens.  It is part of the Autonomy General Assembly, which is a gathering space for the different projects that are housed within Woodbine.  The idea behind Woodbine comes in the wake of Occupy, but takes its motivations from the Zapatistas in Chiapas, the ZADs in France, communities in Rojava, and all those who have struggled for liberation.  As we begin answering questions of autonomy, we are faced with the myriad of material obstacles in our way.  Health, or our lack thereof, can be seen as a crucial weakness in the revolutionary struggle.  We are tied to a “modern” health system that fundamentally removes our bodies from a larger physical reality.  We are made to become cells in revolt, aberrant genes, failed organs, physicalities riddled with disease.  Disease becomes individualized as “health” and “wellness” becomes commodified.  States of mental health become symbols of individualized weakness. Propensities toward depressed states, or anxious disorders, and “imbalances” in the brain necessitate chemical intervention, while never addressing the overwhelming emptiness of modern life.  An insane mind is the mind that can adapt to an insane society, and from the news today, we are surely going insane.  Insanity as the only rational response to an insane world, but what contemporary visions of “health” require of us, in order to perpetuate this economy, is that we be atomized, necessarily taking on our struggles alone, seeing them as the individual product of a weak, chemically imbalanced mind. If we refuse this logic, begin to express the anger necessary for a health that recognizes the truly horrific nature of the time we’re living in and develop shared practices of care that diffuse that isolation, we can begin to grow the collective backbone we so desperately need.Apart from a critique of modern theories on health, we as a community have lost all control over our health.  Our individualized choices to workout, eat right, not smoke, etc are important, but wholly insufficient to answer the demands of this century.  In order to access healthcare, we are tied to jobs that are literally killing us, whether it be mental depravity or physical degradation.  Many people are in constant fear of losing this state granted access, but then are also in fear of having to access such a system, a system that is the cause of more than 50% of bankruptcies.  Because we have relegated health to these institutions, we have lost our ability to heal ourselves.  We no longer know the abundance of nature in helping to create health.  Most people cannot perform basic first aid or use simple techniques for health.  Many communities lack any cognizance or skill to handle the inevitable emotional collapse of our comrades.  In addition, these institutions fundamentally cannot address the issues of climate change, economic collapse, or disruption of key infrastructure.  They are as weak as we are, as evidenced by the effects of superstorms on the health infrastructure of New Orleans and New York.  How can these institutions help us when the very air we breath is killing us?  How do they help us adapt to a world without clean water?  To answer the sadness in our souls to live in a world where we have killed all the fish in the ocean?  To answer simply, they cannot.  They are tied to the same system we are, replete with the same fundamental limitations.  But we are not the same. While we are in chains, we are not of the system.  We have not always lived this way.  And to remember this fact is to regain our humanity.  Where we are nowWithin Woodbine, the struggle for autonomy has been broken down into specific “tracks”, meant to focus our attention on tangible obstacles to building functioning communities.  The health track is composed of a mix of health professionals and those with informal training in various health practices.  We place an emphasis on re-creating a sense of community wellness and the dissemination of skills.  We work to create ties with those who practice herbal medicines, massage, kinesiology, acupuncture, meditation, yoga and other forms of so called “alternative” medicine.  We work on owning our own definition of wellness, from the physical to the mental.  In addition, we investigate current systems of western medicine, skills, and ultimately, work to develop an ability to manipulate these institutions to serve our goals.  We do not reject modern methods of medicine, but rather recognize the need to detach the knowledge from the oppressive institutions that guard it. Food and the environment have a fundamental role in health, and because of this, will have their own tracks to address their wide breadth of knowledge.  Overall, this track allows us to answer the questions of how do we begin the process of removing our physical and mental minds from an oppressive system, to reclaim our control over health and use health to increase our collective autonomy.  Within the city, there is a public health infrastructure with clinics and hospitals.  While there are significant problems associated with these institutions, they do provide much of the emergency and chronic care in the city.  There are also spaces dedicated to holistic type medicine, although many of these are inaccessible to large portions of the population.  For these reasons, we started by building a health resource center within our Woodbine space.  The space is meant to be a means to involve community members, understand the care-related skills they have, and be an informational center.  We have public open times for the community, staffed by one of our members.  We also have begun offering a series of basic skills, including basic first aid, wound care,community health, food and nutrition, wellness, and many others.  Our goal is that participants can use the informational aspect to understand their disease process, find resources of different modalities, and either receive aid in navigating the health systems in place or find treatment within the space itself.  And finally, we have a preventative aspect, with our communal Sunday dinners, organic farm share, and weekly workout sessions, where we are beginning the process of owning our own health.Where we are goingOur overarching goal is to examine what health autonomy would look like for us here in the city.  We are beginning with the basics by providing ways to interact with neighbors, to think of health in a communal sense, and to aggregate the people and resources from which to begin our journey.  Our short term goal is to continue with our introductory skill shares, create concrete ways to navigate the overwhelming health infrastructure that exists, and build a health community.  We are also beginning to experiment with providing care outside of the realm of state control.  This practice may involve working outside the structure of licenses, certifications and insurance.  Our intention is always to heal, and so we must find ways to do so that protects providers and patients.  As we progress, we will consider creating a larger clinical space, with more emphasis on offering a range of clinical modalities.  Finally, as Woodbine looks to expand our sense of territory to upstate NY, we will look to an expansion of the project to include a more rural context, likely in the form of a functioning low-fee/no-pay clinic.   As we move through the journey towards health autonomy, we find ourselves in a context that has removed us from our ability to understand our reality .  We fight that disconnection and work to build the infrastructure that can allow us the space to envision a new existence.  We look forward to hearing your stories, to understand your struggles and to collectively create the foundations to answer these monumental questions.   My questions for peers doing related work elsewhere…How do you create sustainability?  Donation based/grant based/fee based? How do you interact with existing structures? How do you work with or around licensures/certifications to provide safe care? Contact us:Woodbine.nycWoodbine Health Autonomy FB group 
I'm an Interior Architect, Business Woman, Mother and active citizen. I have been running my own Design business for the past 9 years ever since I have left the corporate hospitality world. I started with my company Design2Style in partnership with my Husband, designing residential & interiors and developing brand design for companies. Over time, my interest and knowledge of design thinking and strategy increased, gaining experience in projects and from attending various conferences on the subject, which resulted in moving forward, evolving personally and professionally. I launched Belgium Design Council, which applies design thinking on the project's infrastructural level. This allowed me to move from aesthetic design to applying design thinking processes in ‘designing’ communities.We're working on several projects at the moment. I've got increasingly interested in Business Improvement District concept over the last couple of years, which existed since the 1960’s/70’s in the Northern America, and concentrated on socio-economical regeneration for business and communities as a whole. The combination of a geographical zone including businesses, community, people and the collaboration of those elements creating successful public, private and citizen partnerships, in order to enhance people's lives and environments. Creating sustainable socio/economic regeneration. BIDs and similar partnerships have been launched around the world - in Sweden, Scotland, Germany, England - and one of them is our non-profit organization of BIDs Belgium. We're also planning to launch BID EU in the near future, in order to create a platform for sharing best practices with each other and filter these down to ground level. I'm planning to concentrate on specific target groups - besides the regular social innovation aspect, there will also be the social inclusion of elderly, youth, special needs people and on ways in which we can involve them and make them feel more as a part of the community. There is a plan for the pilot version to be launched in September in my own community in Brussels, Koekelberg, in collaboration with the municipality. We will address the project to both 300 businesses of this district and 3 other neighboring districts.We have also been developing and presenting the general information and interactive sessions for the BIDs in Brussels. We invited architects, developers, retailers, freelancers and members of the communities and explained the concept, but also ask them for feedback. There has been positive feedback and some are really keen on implementing, but they need guidance - and we want to prepare and adapt the framework which has been shared by other BID countries, which would be useful and simplify the launching of BIDs across Belgium. The model works this way: by defining the geographical zone, having a collaborative approach to working together as a community, whilst addressing the issue that is of priority and defining the projects for that area. BIDs can be supported by a levy that business owners, citizens, and the municipality contributes to. Crowd-funding has also been used to support local projects. Some cities have it already in Belgium, albeit these are a slightly different models - Mechelen and Ghent for example. The BID is a non-profit organization, with a task force representation with an open source, collaborative and transparent approach and it needs to be inclusive of the Open Care element.I also have a personal project close to my heart - in which Belgium Design Council works on also. It's about special needs children. As there is a personal background to it - one of my sons is nearly 11 yrs old and is autistic, with emotional and behavior regulation challenges. As we have been dealing with this since he was 2 yrs old, I have observed there is a big gap between what's available on the grassroots level for parents and at an institutional level. There is no support in the communities for parents with children with special needs for example. This personal project is about injecting more tools and awareness with creating more inclusive care in the communities themselves - also by using design thinking and visual tools, beyond pictograms available online. I have realized how much sensory input and additional energy my son needs and how much its presence could help him move around and understand things better - and visual designers and illustrators could greatly help such children. As Belgium Design Council we are planning now to fill this gap - one way is to work with the schools where children with special attend.  Our son will be changing to a further specialised school closer to our home now. I have spoken with the principal and he is very interested some of the creative inclusive projects I have suggested, but the school has no time to initiate these - I have the experience and the knowledge and wish gather some support from other parents and see if we can move forward. Same for the people in the municipality, who are very much interested in this kind of work.My Husband and I are also heavily involved in another nonprofit organization in Brussels and volunteer at a local football club, with over 300 youth from various backgrounds. We also have a goal of making this youth more inclusive and open - both for children with special needs, but also for refugees, who get refused from other football clubs around the city for example. We will introduce the first refugee children into the club for the coming season, which we are very proud of, as we see this as part of the wider community work we are involved in.It seems to me that the initiatives, such as BIDs, should, in fact, be initiated by the city itself - and whenever I speak with the politicians, they understand it but resources and knowledge bases are at times limited. It can be challenging when systems and organizations need to change, understand and adopt design thinking themselves in order to be open for such initiatives and collaborations between private, public and citizens. The concept and ideas can appear too complicated, too political, too new and disruptive, yet many cities around the world are seeing the value this can bring.This is why we decided to be active citizens, to get involved in various initiatives we are working on, pulling in our network and knowledge base - and turn things around by, inspiring, collaborating and sharing information, including enlisting more volunteers from the football club to the BIDs projects, showing that non-hierarchical organisations welcome everyone. It's important to talk, share, bring people together, because it's part of the process of change - and this is where OpenCare comes as a partner.Do you design better communities yourself? Do you have experience in different projects that solve problems of local groups by mobilizing them and the resources available at hand? Or maybe you know of an interesting project that feeds into this challenge? Share your story by leaving a comment, or by submitting your own post here.
Reagent is a term used in chemistry to describe a process in which one determines a presence of a substance by sparking a chemical reaction with it.In Ghent, ReaGent is a space opened by enthusiasts of bioengineering in order to spark interest and passion for natural sciences among the citizens of the city. And to prove that the increasing know-how will play a huge role in innovation and future of technology, also with a local focus.People are more and more aware that biology will shape future technology, by improving its performance and making it more sustainable. Yet both researchers and students lack access to knowledge about it - especially in a form of a laboratory, where everyone is free to experiment, try, learn, exchange and meet. Biology education is becoming outdated and we need students able to design the sustainable solutions of the future. The situation has been changing in the past years across Europe - many graduates, biology enthusiasts, opened biolabs equipped with instruments that they built themselves or that companies were giving away. Surprisingly, it’s a rather common situation - for many of the businesses the costs of maintenance or even disposal of these sophisticated machines is higher than just giving them away to whomever would be interested to use it.I have been involved in ReaGent since over a year. The space offers both paid and unpaid access and program - the privileged ones fund this way free classes for poorer children. Part of the funding comes also from the memberships, which guarantee access to the lab 2 days a week.Places like ReaGent spark creativity in sciences by working in an accessible, open and flexible manner. Their mission now is to give access to this type of education to the whole of Flanders, and extend their network by inviting for example designers to come and create biodegradable materials.As OPENandchange allied, ReaGent would bring about the same qualities to the application: they would bring scientific education, which in turn would be used in innovation and hacking applicable in care.If you have advice or another project which is relevant, let's discuss it here. A question to get the discussion going: what is the fairest way in the long term to fund education outside of, but as an addition to, the traditional state-funded system - from who and how? http://reagentlab.org/
Hello EdgerydersFor my fellowship I will write about Huis VDH, which I introduced earlier. In short:‘Huis VDH wants to give time and resources to people to experiment, try, fail and succeed around new models for the present and future of Brussels. We are convinced that the magic happens by connecting citizen’s skills and needs. We aim to become a laboratory for urban change hosting citizens in search of anchor.’But Huis VDH doesn’t fall from the sky. For me, being in good care in the city has always meant having a healthy living environment. To create such a good environment we need good city planners and a great vision on public space. Something Brussels is still lacking...Once upon a time, there was public space.From 2012 onwards, I got fascinated by the concept of public space and how to bring it back in the center of everyday life in the city. After reading a call by philosopher Philippe Van Parijs about the urge to design new ways to interact in public space because of the limits of private space in the city, I got involved in Pic Nic The Streets and Canal Park BXL that both asked the government to urgently work on citizen based public space to better the living conditions of each citizen. Both won the political battle, but the result wasn’t really what we were hoping for. Pic Nic The Streets led to a carfree city center, but so poorly planned that a strong movement of anti carfree people could rise and are now threatening to stop  further reorganisation of the city center. Looking at the plans for the big park, we are scared that gentrification will become an even bigger issue now in the zone around Canal Park. We were hoping for an inclusive design knowing that a lot of poor people are living in that neighbourhood. Now we are continuing to work as an observer with a cargo bike installation called Canal d’Accroche (part of the project Vélo M2, explained here) in that neighbourhood, hoping to bring them some resilience.From Maison Du People to Huis VDH, a story about citizen centred design.Since I was a guide and learned about the architect Horta and his Art Nouveau Style, I’m fascinated with the Maison Du Peuple, a building from the end of the 19th century that housed all kind of projects and people wanting to better society. It was a place where ideals could grow, and people could come listen to each other in an open dialogue. I started working on an open call to repurpose the empty Bourse building into a new Maison Du Peuple, right in the hearth of the city. But just days after finishing the text the attacks in Bataclan occurred and life in Brussels changed dramatically for a couple of weeks…I gave it a rest and set my focus on a vacant building above the well-known music bar Bonnefooi: 4 floors, 500m2, and lots of potential, but also lots of work to be done. Without any budget or action plan, I started gathering people in the house, now called Huis VDH. The only thing I knew was that I wanted an inclusive project build from a common idea: Designing a semi-public space in such a way that the wellbeing of the neighbourhood / city improves. Huis VDH will therefore become a test case, because it isn’t the first or last vacant space above a shop in Brussels: there are more than 23 000 m2 documented.So there we were, having a space, an open concept and a lot of potential. The first thing we did was taking time to create a common practice: we designed our way of gathering through a futurism session created by Fo.AM that allowed us to gather all ideas from each person who wanted to get involved and, like a funnel, filter only the most common. For us, it was important to make Huis VDH as open as possible, so that any new member with the right mind-set could easily become a full involved partner in the building process. After a philosophical six months, we had the sprout of an idea: Huis VDH was born.It’s all in the name, for Huis VDH it is no other. ‘Huis’ means ‘home’ in Dutch and that is what we are aiming to become for people that are drowning in a sea of complexity of city life. We try to not judge each other, but rather think solution oriented: Help out where we can, and bring the right people around the table. Our space is designed to welcome each kind of small organization working on local issues: cultural, social or technological. We try to design each space so it can be multifunctional and become a temporary rest spot for thosein search of an anchor. We believe like edgeryders: “ that the power of a community is bigger than the sum of all parts.”One big challenge we will be facing in the next couple of years is to use our talent to organize ourselves within crisis. Big problems are ahead and we need to build up resilience to react quickly to an ever changing surrounding. Huis VDH is trying to take that challenge inside our own development. For us resilience can be developed on four levels: knowledge, vulnerability, out of the box exercise, and modification.Shared knowledgeOpen Source is all around us, and also in Huis VDH. After living for 5 weeks in an open source innovation camp called POC21, I find solutions to every kind of problem through this model of thinking. Knowledge is there to be shared and if we create the right methodology we will find more easily solutions to any kind of problems. That is why we started mapping out every encounter we had through metamaps, we budget our work with cobudget and use a sharing file system inside the house.Showing your vulnerable selfWhen working in a collective environment, we tend to show our better self, hiding our flaws in the first place. But a strong collective group is as strong as its weakest link, and therefore we find it important that we are open and honest to each other. Having personal problems is something common, but sharing them is less. We try to create a trust field around Huis VDH where personal development is as important as the common goal of the organization. Caring about each other as a human being before seeing it as a resource for a project. In order to bring this theory into practice, we have made the first floor as cosy as possible, so people can just hang around and talk freely to each other. We make meetings short and efficient so there is time to discuss at the bar the more intimate stuff, not with all, but with whom we trust.Putting ourselves outside the systemIn the first six months, I was convinced we could create a complete system without the need of money. Only through exchange we could rebuild the house. This gave us a clear barrier to work around, and even if after six months we partially let money in our system, we were trained to think about solutions without money by using the skills, knowledge and resources of one another. This is one of the many ways we try to build challenges to ourselves to constantly think out of the box. When crisis occurs, we need to think and find solutions fast. Creating these exercises in a calm period will help create resilience in all members.Modification as constancyFinally, another way resilience can be created is by being in a constantly changing environment. Therefore Huis VDH doesn’t have fixed spaces. Every room can be rearranged to have a different use. Having this as one of the ground rules, we create a constant reality of change that makes us well trained in the art of adaptation, a virtue needed in times of crisis. In September, we will be, thanks to @Nadia, hosting the Open Care Weekend for Brussels.We see it as an opportunity to use our space for a common goal and adapt it while having people using the space. It will be our first external happening and we are really excited.When working for Huis VDH, I have a phrase by Bachelard that always comes to mind: “Our House is our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word” We can’t forget about the complexity of a home when we want to harmonize it. In cosmos, planets collide, new stars are born and a black hole sometimes sucks up even galaxies. This will be the same for people, ideas and principles. The most important for the wellbeing of this microcosm will be the search for constant balance.In September we will be co-hosting the Brussels OPENandChange Workshop and that will kick off our Huis VDH. In the follow up we are working on a concept called Pirate Kitchen: using the resources from dumpster diving or own grown combined with hobby cooks we want to bring each week around 10 people gravitating around the same interest / problem / field but don’t know or rarely meet. We wouldn’t give them any explanation about whom they will meet, only that they will have a dinner with interesting  people. They will have to find out why they are all here, and what they could bring to each other. A sort of blind date for change makers. Could this be an interesting form, or does it already occur in some places?I’d appreciate any feedback in a comment below, and see you on 10-11 September for the workshop!  The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
Interesting read and thought to share: Two UPC students design and build a low-cost wheelchair for use in developing countries. The wheelchair can be put together or taken apart in 15 minutes, costs €70 to make and is built out of two bicycle wheels, two supermarket trolley wheels and a PVC pipe to help address some of these unmet needs and make life easier for the people with motor disabilities who are most in need of assistance. The design of the DIY wheelchair includes two sizes, Standard and Kids, and the weight of the assembled chair ranges from 15 to 20 kg. The useful life of either model is from three to five years under normal conditions of use.  Once put together, it performs like any conventional wheelchair and offers the same level of comfort. It has a seat cushion, footrest, push handle, backrest and wheels with handrims so the user can propel the chair and be more independent.  Read the full article: http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/two-catalan-students-design-low-cost-wheelchair-for-developing-countriesWatch the video: http://www.diywheelchair.xyz/wheelchair.php
I came across this great article on how the Amish culture and their approach towards healthcare in the United States. The Amish - a culture of independance and thrift may be a way to balance community support and individual responsibility. A cost-conscious, community-based take on American healthcare may be able to teach the general population a thing or two about dealing with a broken healthcare system. Health care practices vary considerably across Amish communities and from family to family. Many Amish use modern medical services, but others turn to alternative forms of treatment within their community.  The Amish society accepts responsibility for their own actions and chooses not to depend on services offered by the state and Amish communities opt out of the government-funded insurance. Opposed to commercial insurance and they pride themselves on taking care of their own. To assist one another, they willingly offer donations when a member of their community becomes ill. It may not fit in this area, but I thought it was an interesting read a thought I would share.  Excerpt from the article:  Plain communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention. Coming from an ethic of thriftiness, many Plain people distrust the motives of hospital administrators and even doctors themselves. They believe a profit motive can influence courses of treatment. They are also keenly attuned to unnecessary expenditures within the system.“In the Amish world, healthcare is seen as a ministry,” says Wengerd, “which is exactly what healthcare in the [non-Plain] world used to be.” Remember apprenticeships and house calls? The doctor used to be viewed like a minister who sacrificed his life for the patient, but there has been a shift. “The patient now sacrifices his livelihood for the doctor’s wellbeing.”  Read the full article here :  http://qz.com/695101/the-amish-understand-a-crucial-element-of-modern-medicine-that-most-americans-dont/  
Edgeryders, a global action network of change makers in 40 + countries, is organising a joint application to the MacArthur foundation’s 100 Million Dollar grant and invites you to participate. This collaborative process was started on the morning of July 18, 2016. Its original intent was to fundraise to support 100 initiatives that contribute towards providing high-quality, affordable health- and social care for all.  We know first-hand that it’s difficult for small initiatives to access sufficient resources alone. Especially if they are breaking new ground. Our hope with this initiative is to make it easier for people to start deeper collaborations, build collective awareness, and pool resources towards achieving impact at scale.Between now and October 2, are visiting different countries to convene participants in our joint bid for the 100 million USD grant. Each event is hosted by a local initiative which resonates with our own ethos and approach:September 24, Berlin: https://www.facebook.com/events/599135516912506/September 24, Brussels: https://www.facebook.com/events/280924708934187/September 25, Paris: https://www.facebook.com/events/1243427585675831/October 2, New York: https://www.facebook.com/events/208119996269998/HOW TO PARTICIPATEHave a look at the proposal, complete the application (very easy- requires 2.5 hours of your time in total) and come meet us at one of the events:The draft proposal is being built here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1euJ95uJndp-w7xiAaBgLsTXgA2QrugH2VJDfDgraSfw/editThe application process is available here: http://openandchange.careWelcome on board,we're very much looking forward to learning and working with you!Please use #OPENandChange to spread the word and coordinate with others Partners.....

I've met Éireann for the first time a couple of months ago, during LOTE5 in Brussels. I mostly remember him for knowing probably all brand new, absurd Twitter accounts, and being able to quote quite a lot of their content.Then I have learned a bit more - and the more unveiled, the more impressive it got. There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices. He knows a lot about that stuff.Éireann with his friend, Dr. Marie Moe started investigating the security of pacemakers - as Marie's life actually depends on a little instrument that generates each of her heartbeats. And runs on a proprietary code. This means she has to implicitly trust the programmers, and despite her and Eireann’s years of assessing devices for security holes, they wouldn’t normally be “allowed” to investigate the security of such devices.This implies how little a regular customer of similar devices is informed about the ways they work, what protocols and tools they use, where their data is stored, etc. It has everything to do with person's safety - and still, companies keep most of the key information secret from the users, making them more vulnerable.I suggest you watch this great video from 32C3, where Marie and Éireann tell about their journey.Obviously, the issue of safety transcends this case and applies to a whole range of tools that increasingly improve our quality of life and longevity. The security flaws are potentially causing exactly the opposite, making for a health/life hazard. There are concerns about privacy too, where your medical data flows around the world to companies that may or may not be taking measures to protect it.But that's not all - Éireann works also as an advisor for European Network for Cyber Security (ENISA), has founded http://www.concinnity-risks.com/, and works as a Senior Risk Researcher at Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. He is loosely affiliated with I Am The Cavalry, a cyber security movement, whose motto is “Safer. Sooner. Together.”He contributes to our OPENandChange application vast expertise in the security of medical devices, and embedded devices. He will be helping DIY makers, programmers, and engineers with training on how to build safer code, and what standards they will want to comply with to produce products for different markets. He's also offering insight into vulnerability research and standards-based research, contributing safety and transparency knowledge to this huge, open swarm OPENandChange wants to become. Lastly, he loves the idea of preparing a consumer training and equipping people who rely on medical devices with knowledge and clear questions they can ask about their own devices.Finally, Éireann has just been announced an Open Web Fellow for Privacy International and he will be taking the word out about our idea while advocating for open cyberspace.
Access to potable water is a severe and increasingly pressing health issue for many countries. An affordable solution for poor water quality that will improve health within developing countries. Communities will be taught how to make the filter and the purification drops - made from clay, water, saw dust and small amounts of silver. Then it will become a source of local enterprise from the sales of the filter and drops.  Interesting read: http://innovatedevelopment.org/2014/05/13/the-madidrop-an-affordable-easy-to-use-water-purification-tabletVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsAJ9BqcmoAccess to potable water is a severe and increasingly pressing issue for countries in the Global South. Due to a confluence of factors including overuse, population growth and climate change, an estimated two-thirds of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025. One recent innovation that could potentially revolutionize water purification in poor, rural communities is the MadiDrop.The MadiDrop is a porous ceramic disc that has been infused with silver or copper. When dropped in water, the tablet releases ionic silver or copper that strips away bacteria and pathogens to produce clean, drinkable water. Each tablet is capable of treating 10 to 20 litres of water for up to six months. The result is an affordable, easily distributable and long-lasting alternative for families who lack access to a safe, potable water source.The MadiDrop is the second water treatment technology developed by PureMadi, an organization formed by a group of interdisciplinary students from the University of Virginia. Their first project was the creation of a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. The filters use local labour, readily available materials (clay, sawdust and water) and are treated with a dilute solution of silver nano-particles that effectively filter out common waterborne pathogens. The PureMadi ceramic filters were designed to create a cheap and sustainable point-of-use water purification solution for low-income households. To date, they have been well-received and highly effective among families in Limpopo province, South Africa.The impetus for the MadiDrop was to apply this successful model to create an even cheaper point-of-use water treatment technology. The MadiDrop can be used in a variety of water storage containers, and at only a few dollars per drop, can provide families with purified water for an extended period of time. Lab results look promising but extensive field testing is still required to determine whether the MadiDrop is a sustainable and culturally appropriate solution. With any luck, the MadiDrop will eventually be widely used to improve clean water access and curb the spread of waterborne diseases in low-income communities.
In 2015 both of us have been diagnosed with different types of cancer. Ever since we were diagnosed with cancer until the end of our treatment we both were more than convinced our body could fight this and we eventually would win the battle. We were always pretty fanatic with sports and always had a focus on eating healthy. We immediately started to look for information on how to keep our body in the best shape during the chemo and radiation attack. During the first appointments we had at the hospital with a nurse specialized in cancer treatment, we received a lot of information on the treatment itself and its possible side effects. However, there was no information added on (healthy) food, which products to eat best during treatment or information on the possibility to continue exercising.At home our search started at the internet and we looked up questions like: Is it healthy to sport during treatment? What is the best food to eat? Should we be adding supplements to our daily meals? Who can help to keep my body in the best shape?Through the dietician working at the general practitioners office Carry got a first list of products, which could affect the treatment and also some products to prevent loosing too much weight. We did not know if we had to expect a weight loss, because that is what we all think chemo does to your bodies. What we forget is that you get a lot of medicines to fight the treatment side effects, which have again their own side effects, such as potentially gaining weight (take for example prednisone, one tends to store a lot of body liquids that could cause weight increase).The information from the GPs dietician was not sufficient, therefore we asked for the advice of a dietician at the hospital. During the first appointment we asked all kinds of different questions, but we were shocked by the answers. Before we were ill, we ate very healthy, fresh/fair products, now we got the advice of the hospital dietician to buy ready meals in case we would did not feel well enough to cook. Or in case you would lose weight to eat artificially manufactured nutrition containing ingredients to increase weight.Currently there are all kinds of ‘food fanatics’ and ‘health hypes’. We are convinced that healthy food should not be a trend. We don’t want to focus on trends or hypes; our focus lies at informing people about healthy food and “back to basic”. We want to reach the target group of cancer patients, to help them in finding good food to fight the battle of their life. As we experienced ourselves, medical specialists at the hospital don’t have enough time to guide a patient in the best way and many dieticians follow the ‘old’ rules and are promoting the medical food of the pharmaceutics industry.We want to start a foundation, which will have a wide network of researchers, specialized food coaches, sport coaches and doctors to gather information and advice, on how to compose healthy menu’s for cancer patients and provide information on healthy ways of exercising during your illness. Not only in general, but also customized, for each individual. Our plan is to set up an overview listing healthy products to eat during your treatment, but also listing products, that are particularly unhealthy.Next to that we want build up a network to reach out to people who cannot cook or are not able to exercise (or just walk) on their own. Look around to your own environment. If you were aware that there is a single man/woman, who lives a couple of streets away, which is not able to cook because he/she is too ill, would you not cook (needless to say that this needs to be in line with the advice of the foundation) for that person? This is called community care.Focusing on the hospital food will be the second target (long-term). Once we start informing patients and start working with researchers, food coaches, sport coaches and doctors, we will eventually be able to slowly change the hospital food.Figuring out the healthiest ways to fight your battle by staying in direct contact with your target group is part of specialized care, which would be the future in health care. Not general, but focus on single patients with their own problems/questions and side effects.Challenge(Customized) advice serving cancer patients during treatment (chemo, radiation,…) to ensure optimal nutrition and exercise.focusing on natural instead of artificially produced ingredientsemphasizing the importance of regular and moderately intensive exercise.ChannelsShort-term: online (info and community)Long-term: face to face (workshops on two main subjects)Activities:develop and maintain a blog/website/platform with menu proposals containing healthy ingredients, working together with food coaches and researchers on this. It will be an interactive platform, on which people can also share their own experiences etc.,contact points in the Netherlands on sports coaches to contact for guidance,set up sports projects and readings about healthy food and sports for cancer patients,create communities for healthy cooking, places where people can buy healthy food in case there are not able to cook themselves when they are very ill, or don’t have a partner.Type of community involvedCommunity consists of cancer patients (no age restrictions or type of cancer)Solution proposed; effect on users life?Ensure optimal knowledge sharing to enable patients to continue the health-minded lifestyle of before their illness. How is it open?It is accessible to anybody online (could be perceived as restricting because the community is language specific and starting with the Netherlands!) How does it ‘care’?This platform contributes to care by offering a space where patients can share their knowledge and learn from each other concerning the subjects “healthy nutrition” and “exercise”. Also it allows easy access to expert knowledge. The platform is not supposed to replace or complement any scientific research sources. It is solely focusing on the easy access of exactly this information as well as the information shared amongst experts by experience.
This story of mine only wanted to come out through an interview carried out online by Noemi. Hopefully it gives you a peek inside the very personal experience of being part of a sort of grand thing – a network of people becoming active in the healthcare provision chain and caring for each other despite not having met.   Noemi: Introduce us to the time when the cytostatics network came about. Was someone ill able or unable to access treatment from healthcare providers? How did they go by?Sabina: It was the fall of 2009 when it all started for me: the dizziness, the fatigue, trouble breathing, walking, doing  basically anything. In October, I just put it on my crazy life style: mother of two, finishing the PhD, teaching at the Music University. In November it was clear something else was going on. So I went to a private lab- the thought of a state hospital was too scary- and had a blood work done. Except it did not work the usual way: the results could not be read due to a strange characteristic of the sample.I knew it was a bad sign, so I turned to my adoptive grandmother, dr. Mirjam Bercovici. She figured it out in minutes, wrote me a recommendation letter and sent me to a real hospital. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia – a very rare blood disease- was confirmed and three years of fighting it in Romania and Austria followed.How did she know and how does this relate to the problems of cytostatics in Romania?For many years, Mirjam, a hematologist, was the chief of the Pediatric Department in the oncologic ward of the biggest hospital in Romania: Fundeni. She was now long retired, but still having nightmares about kids who could not be saved. Because, you see, even though the treatment had clear indications about when and how to give the medicines, they were not always available. The doctors in her section did miracles. Curing cancer without the necessary drugs is indeed a miracle. The always missed some important dose, they could not offer the kids the standard treatment their colleagues in the West were used to. It was the communist era and everything was very difficult, even for the most important health care center in the country.So when she sent me there, she knew that I would receive the best possible care, but she was also aware of the limitations of a poor system, as populated with amazing doctors as it was.During my time in Fundeni, I spent lots of time with people dealing with forms of blood cancer. I was “lucky”: only had to buy once dexamethason for myself, but they were not so lucky:  either filling tones of papers to get the newest drugs (the usual line was: we are giving to you, but only with ”the dossier”), either they had to figure out how to obtain certain medication themselves.But two bone morrow aspirations and numerous transfusions later, when my condition worsened, there were talks about a treatment  reserved for Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mabthera, or Rituximab. Rituximab was not approved in AutoImmune Hemolytic Anemia in Romania at that time. It still isn’t.Was anyone inside hospitals listening or fighting back?The situation was rather strange. The drug was expensive, not approved for my AIHA, but available in theory. My roommates  with Lymphoma could get it based on the dossier (so not standard). But they were missing other drugs, cheaper cytostatics like Bleomicin, compensated 100% from the state! It was like in the times when Mirjam Bercovici was active, all over again. Like nothing had changed in 40 years. Frustration was working both sides, because treatments sessions were postponed, sick people and doctors being equally worried.All I knew was that doctors advised patients to figure out how to get the drugs. I had no idea how the people got it, as I was preoccupied with my own, at that time unsolvable, health issues. Tell us how one would send or get medicine, about the network and how it worked. Were people afraid of the (il)legality of all this?Drained both mentally and financially, I moved to Vienna, became self employed, paid a high tax on healthcare, tried Rituximab with very little success, worked throughout my illness and also got a splenectomy when a terrible  relapse made it clear there is no other way out of this. A few months after, I read an article on a website: How I became a member in the cytostatic network. There were many similarities with my struggle: people not having access to medication as cheap as dexamethason, a description of the oldest Pharmacy in Vienna, which I knew so well, and most of all, the solidarity. A few weeks later though, I joined the network of Cytostatics.  I was going home for a concert and my good friend Simona Tache shared a status form a Youngman who asked if someone is going to Bucharest from Vienna. I knew exactly what it was about, the dots were easy to connect.I met Vlad Voiculescu that evening, and the next day I followed the instructions and took the  transport to Bucharest. Basically, transportation worked like this: You take the medicines in a thermal bag, put it in the fridge and take them out only when you leave the house for the airport. At the security, you take it out and tell the officers you have sensitive medicine there. Sometime they ask you who is it for, sometimes they don’t. You are only allowed to have it for your self or  your family. For me, anyone suffering in Romania is family….so it never felt like lying.In Bucharest, you had Valeriu waiting for you at the airport, or you met him later in the day. Valeriu is a taxi driver who delivers the cytostatics to the Pavel Association – a NGO working for the children in Fundeni, or directly to the ones in need, sick people or caregivers. The news about the Network circulated by word of mouth. Some people knew about its existence, some didn’t. The only thing they knew is that there is someone in Vienna who buys medicines if you give him the prescription and that you can pay him when you can. There was no financial gain, on the contrary. Vlad would receive the prescriptions, buy the cytostatics out of his own pocket and then got the money later. Or much later. No deadlines, no pressure. Just the will to help.Were all members sufferers or family of sufferers? Was anybody other than Vlad in charge?When the article about the Network emerged, over 300 people joined the network through the website medicamente-lipsa.ro and found ways to bring home what was missing. Not all of them had sick members of their families. For most, it was just the little they could do in this horrible situation. The website was Med-Alert ‘s Association’ initiative, where Vlad is a founder, and there were more people involved in obtaining the cytostatics and other medicines. Still, Vlad is the one who got the dice rolling. He has the gift of inspiring others to do good, and it’s contagious. Even though the majority of people involved did not now about each other, and many still do not know until this day, as little contact between the carriers of the medicines has happened. Still, the ones who met in real life bonded immediately and I will always state that the main gain of the Network was the amazing friendships resulting from it.How did things eventually change and what’s the situation so far?After the article on Hotnews about the Network, a high number of interviews with the authorities filled the tv news evening after evening. The situation was indeed outrageous: you pay the taxes, you have medicine 100% compensated by the state because you pay those taxes, but when it comes to it, they are nowhere available in Romania, and you have to buy them outside the country.  Cornered by jurnalists, the Minister of Health made hundreds of promises, with some results. Things were sometimes better, and sometimes worse. The whole System in itself acted like a cancer: remissions and relapses.At the moment, Vlad Voiculescu is the new Minister of Health. After a tragic event in October 2015, known as the Colectiv fire, where 64 people died, the whole Government was changed and a lot of young – under 45- dynamic people were named in key positions.One of the actions that Vlad took in the short period of time he’s been in charge is to make a smart alliance with  more countries: Bulgaria, Moldova, Croatia, Latvia, Macedonia, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Slovakia,  in order to get better access to medication. More countries means more people, so a much  bigger market, a fact that would discourage the Pharma companies to ignore it by withdrawing a medicine  by citing  small numbers in sales.What do you think was the reason for people to participate so actively? If it were another problem and not a deadly disease, would they mobilize as much?The Public opinion in Romania is, unfortunately, used to crises and bad situation concerning healthcare. The media is full of fundraising events for children or young people who need to get treatment abroad, the news are full of reports of malfunctions of the healthcare system.In all this mess, there will always be people willing to contribute in any way to the wellbeing of others.But maybe the reason of this high rate participation in the network of cytostatics is older than we think, with roots in the communist era. Back then, there was a solution for everything: from lack of food to lack of clothes. Everyone knew someone who could help. The only area not available for this kind of help was healthcare. Both doctors and patients were helpless against a system that didn’t truly provide for its beneficiaries. So people developed a true phobia of hospitals, seen as horrible places, dirty and dangerous, a place where some medical act was provided, but where the family took care of the sick person in the most common sense of the term: from bed sheets to food and hygiene products. The 80s and the 90s were the worse years in terms of healthcare.  The money was less and less, the needs higher.The Network did not come out of nowhere. It came from a long series of malfunctions and struggles, from a time  filled with nightmares that still populates one of the best Romanian doctor’s dreams.The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.  
Doctor.. could you hack me a neuroprosthesis, please?(The thoughts expressed here are a personal view and do not reflect the opinion of former or current employers)When I was a little boy, in 1973, Bob Marley was singing Get Up, Stand up for your rights and the article "Functional electrical stimulation - A new hope for paraplegic patients?" was published. Now, 40 year on, as a senior researcher in rehabilitation engineering I look back on things that are still true: people still fight and patients still hope. Can we improve life conditions, and how? A fundamental question is: do we meet the ‘clients’ needs?Just to give an example:  My mother suffered from a slipped disc so passing the vacuum cleaner was a low back pain for her. As a good boy I stated: "When I grow up mom, I’ll invent a cleaning robot to do the job for you". Someone beat me to it - the cleaning robot is a reality - it sells well, and substitutes the socializing cleaning woman once offered to the elderly. I see now that a cleaning robot is not what a mother really wants. She just wants a good boy saying: “mom, I'll do that part of the cleaning with you”, and do it right away.Until doing my masters, the disabled people were an unknown phenomenon to me. They were not seen, not talked about. I was introduced to young people suddenly wheelchair bound with very limited personal independence due to a spinal cord injury.  They were really nice people and kindly explained about the complexity of such sudden change in abilities and about the need to regain some functional movements.First of all they told me where my ideas were no good and what research needed to be done. Together we coined a method, not an ambitious cure, just a simple idea that could help a bit and during my Ph.D dissertation, we demonstrated feasibility of restoring the hand function using electrical activation of the paralysed muscles. Not a fits all solution and not perfect, but as people say: when you have nothing, a little is a lot, and for some people it works well (see the video)We still research in restoration of walking in paraplegic patients and quite a few assistive devices have been marketed (braces, functional electrical stimulation and robots ).I have been active in the field for 20 years working at major rehabilitation institutions, but I’ve only rarely seen patients being offered these assistive technologies and more rarely seen them  used outside the hospital. Is the problem (as some people with SCI have entrusted me) that there is no such demand or ‘new hope’ for walking? After all, wheels are more efficient than legs - provided accessibility!!!Another hypothesis could be an issue of lack of flexibility of the healthcare system, not beeing able to provide state of the art technology to patients !?Still, for more than forty years we continue producing scientific publications with conclusions like: “…the work carried out so far proves that functional movements can be restored...We therefore believe that patients can benefit. Further research should be carried out”.Please, don’t get me wrong. The research contribute with important results, but obviously there is a problem of transferring the research results into the benefit of people with physical challenges.So far business oriented people responds that it’s because the solutions are not technically good enough, that they only fit a few thousand patients and we continue the research for enhancements to the technology and demonstrate clinically effectiveness.On the other hand less ambitious solutions have been available since the 60’ties, to alleviate the simple problem of foot drop. It applies to thousands of people living with stroke, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. It’s a little electrical device providing electrical impulses to the muscle that lifts the foot and I’ve encountered many people with stroke and multiple sclerosis who gained significantly in mobility (see this user statement).Despite demonstrated clinical efficiency and the immediate advantages it’s almost never proposed to the patients of the health care system (except for the UK [11]). Why???So on the one hand we spend million dollar research to refine technology that is not widely used!!!!. Will our institutions and society implement the provision of such technology!?They need one solution that fits many, because the modern health care model reduce human life in cost/benefit analysis to numbers. However, as long as assistive technology is not used it’s difficult to identify exactly where to improve it.  We know that consumers must be involved early in the development, it’s difficult to do so in a realistic setting. We realize that marketing assistive technology is different than selling a robot vacuum cleaner.So a relatively simple method of restoring the hand function in people having broken their neck (cervical spinal cord injury), that has been demonstrated useful in a large clinical trial has not become available to people who really need it because it does not fit the ‘business model’  of modern health care systems !?As an example we experienced that half the participants wanted to take the experimental device with them home. We are not allowed to do that. I’ve only spend around 50 euro to build the prototype in the laboratory, but we are not in the 1970’ies anymore. In the name of assuring ‘quality’, ‘safety’ etc,  we need to manufacture, CE mark, register as a medical device and so on!.  To provide a patient with a medical device we need to spend hundreds of thousands of euros on paperwork!!! And who is then going to sell at a reasonable price.  Why should people, already challenged economically by loss of health, spend 5-10 k€  for that’s cheap to make?That’s where the revolution of OpenCare –with a subset of community driven provision of assistive technology - comes in.Could we leave people with a physical handicap to become a maker, create their own assistive technology?Would it be possible for, for example, researchers to help people living with a disability to hack a dropped foot correcting device like connecting an Arduino with an extension board?Will doctors provide indications of how to find the assistive technology, which might solve your health issue?That would mean that people should take responsibility for their own rehabilitation devices. They would have full ownership. Clearly they must be guided by healthcare professionals and experts without conflict of interests to ensure that everything is done ethically, safe and sound. How?Maybe if we reunite people living with physical challenges with researchers they would both benefit and research becomes action and functionally useful to the society?What do you think?July 2016                    Rune Thorsen               
Hello all, my name is Franca, I come from Italy.About me.. philosopher, interested in post-structuralism, new ways to do international cooperation, passionate about Geopolitics and China-Africa relations. I’ve worked a lot with refugees, doing legal orientation, helping them to find houses, jobs, but also writing projects to get funds to create new spaces of inclusion.For me it’s interesting to see how many edgeryders are interested in migration or refugee issues and what are the connections to spring up from the many well known problems of working with refugees. I think that it’s possible to underline some key issues when talking about care in this context .Helping Relationships vs Peer RelationshipsKnow your rights vs Rights as a cageIntercultural problems and EmpathyInclusiveness in our society/community: avoid ideological and too theoretical approachA little bit about my experience: In particular I would like to speak about my working period during the so called “North  Africa Emergency” for 3 years. It was a really hard situation for our (Italian) reception system. We were in the paradoxical situation to tell them: “you are an asylum seeker, you HAVE to be an asylum seeker, if you want to have any chances to stay in Europe”.In effect after the Arab Spring Revolution (2011) everything changed. A lot of people that came from Horn of Africa or from other Sub Saharian regions and were in Libya for work decided to come in Europe. Gaddafi’s death meant the end of every agreement “Petrol vs Migrants” that Italian Government had signed with Berlusconi in 2009 (for more details, this Guardian article). So you’d have more asylum seekers in Europe, but also different routes, different countries of origin, different reasons to leave their countries.In 2011 asylum seekers in Italy were more than 40.000 (4 times more than 2010, Eurostat) and Italy became the fourth country for the number of claims submitted, mainly from Nigeria,Tunisia, Ghana and Mali. Most of them have lived for many years in Libya, illiterate in their own native language, living in segregated conditions of work or in the terrible detention centers.The history is long and I’ don’t want to become boring, but only to say that it’s not possible to speak about refugees in general when trying to be of real help. We have to think about the countries where we are and where they come from (for example 90% of Syrian refugees that arrived in Italy decided not to ask asylum here, but in other north EU countries), the migration routes, the particular war conditions, but also the economical ones..For all these reasons it was hard to prepare asylum seekers during North Africa Emergency because they came here for Lybian crisis and most didn’t leave their countries for reasons of “race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion” (Geneva Convention) or for war crisis in their countries (subsidiary protection). And so it was difficult to explain them that formally they have to be asylum seekers, that we need to find these elements in their stories. How could we help them? I usually do some group or individual meetings to inform them about procedures, about what does it mean to ask asylum and I prepare them for the Audition. How to help them to underline important elements in their stories, not lying... A lot of also ethical questions..(Legislation vs Reality)A relation of care: teaching a foreign languageThe relations between us is a relation of help. Sometimes you can help someone too much.The question is more to create opportunities for people to be really active (refugees as #nospectators). There are language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, different contexts of life, different expectations.In this complex and nonlinear context of work that I would like to start from the first point: the challenge to learn a new language, the language of the recipient country. It could be difficult and, in some situations, also impossible, like a WALL.This could be because learning a language means that you accept to be in a country, you decide to start again your life. For a lot of vulnerable people that are victims of violence (in their countries of origin or during the migration travel) it could become a catalyst of bed experiences.So learning a language becomes the first step to say: “I’m here. I would like to take part in this new society and new community.”For all these reasons we needed to share knowledge and experiences about “how to teach in more effective way?”, we needed to create a community - or better to create a space for a community of italian schools! So we started with: www.milano.Italianostranieri.orgIt is a platform of the Municipality of Milan to help foreigners find a school of Italian; there are a lot of problems to find the right schools, also because there are a lot of schools but not connected.We saw that there is this tendency to work alone, providing a service but without  sharing knowledge, critical points.. We knew people that attend 3 different classes, for months,  but they couldn’t speak Italian!So we decided to open our website to every school, private, public, run by volunteers, by NGOs.It’s not simple to help, to take care of someone. It’s a relation full of responsibilities, and good intentions often aren’t enough. We noticed also some schools that are so active in helping their students, helping them in legal stuff or finding jobs.. But all these activities could be dangerous, create a bubble, a dependence relation, mixed with ideological thoughts ..Your students are not yours.To create a community we realized  real life meetings between teachers and schoolmakers. Every school has the possibility to post directly activities, news. So everyone can have an always updated map of time classes, levels, locations etc; But also a moment of exchange between teachers, methods and materials. The teachers all together wrote also an handbook for teachers (in Italian only). We also created an e-learning database to help people to find free resources on internet and a lot of videos (in 5 languages) to explain Laws. Education system... I’ve been asked what projects I think can really make a difference: Projects that work on the concept of resilience, avoid that people identify themselves with their own pain.We saw a lot of people that 5 or 6 months after their arrival start to fade, to turn off. During the first months you hope that your rights became effective, job, home.. But nothing happens. Your life becomes full of complaints.A very interesting school that is part of the community is for example, Asnada. It’s a Montessori/Experimental school. The idea is to teach in a different way. Helping people to use this new language not as a “stranger” language. Usually you start to have 2 languages: the native one that is the language of feelings and relationships and a second language that is the language of bureaucracy. The idea is to teach a language that helps you to construct your new identity, “create your new life here in a new language”.So the lessons became a workshop where we, all together, construct the language, with different ways, methods (arts, music, plays..) and also being a community.So in my opinion it’s really important to be able to find new ways to take care, creating effective spaces of meeting, of real exchange.Work on resilience, opening workshops where people can create something (for ex. FabLabs, Makerspaces..) using open technologies (like Raspberry Pi) could become new ways to take care of people in really big troubles, with strong vulnerabilities and help them to start again.Maybe Opencare, Edgeryders community could be the right place where to start!!What do you think?
The second project started in the Himalayas in Nepal but now has spread to six other countries in developing world. Himalayan Cataract Project is a brain child of Dr. Sanduk Ruit, a Nepalese eye surgeon, who invented a cheap and simple method to operate cataract and restore vision. The organization was later on started by Dr. Tabin, American eye specialist who fell in love with the project while on holidays in Himalaya. The duo is now leading the world’s biggest project aiming at removing cataract for the poorest: through a ten minute microsurgery with articial lens implantation.The project is extraordinary and has been documented in media all over the world. My favorite aspects of it are:The lenses used by the doctor are produced in Tilganga in Kathmandu, Nepal, bringing their costs down from 100 dollars to around 3.5 per piece. The surgery lasts around five minutes per eye, and can be delivered almost anywhere. I saw a documentary about Dr Ruit and his visits in the Himalayan villages, where he opened pop-up clinics and treated dozens of people a day; for most of these people ability to see is crucial not only to their own well-being, but also the condition of the family, which needs their working hands; His lenses have 98% success rate, same as sophisticated and expensive surgeries delivered in USA (using equipment for 1 million dollars) The doctor himself has cured around 120.000 people By funding Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, Dr. Ruit created a whole system that provides patients with complete eye care - and the fees that better-off patients pay for their services finance the free surgeries for the others; In Tilganga they also manufacture eye prosthetic which has similar quality with those produced in the West, but costs 3 dollars, instead of 150. This simple idea turned out incredibly effective and is tested now in other countries.http://www.cureblindness.org/eye-on-the-world/presshttp://www.tilganga.org/
There’s not much focus on Asia in our research - therefore, I’d like to present you some inspiring initiatives from India and Nepal, which present a very different approach to delivering care: actually delivering it.First, of them is MV Akha, a floating clinic that travels along Brahmaputra Netri to the inhabitants of the saporis/the islands. One look at the map of the region is enough to understand how difficult for them it would be to access hospitals and doctors otherwise. 2500 islands sit on the Indian part of the river, which starts from the Tibetan mountains and flows through the Assam region, being a home to 3 million people, 10% of the region’s population.There are numerous reasons why providing these places with health care is particularly difficult: due to huge shortages of doctors in India to start with (0.7 per 1000 people), shifting territories of these islands, unstable population and difficult living conditions: they’re connected to the land by boats and suffer from frequent energy and drinking water deficit. Not to mention strikingly high numbers in maternal and infant mortality.Sanjoy Hazarika pitched the idea of floating clinics to the World Bank in 2000 and received their support - 20,000 dollars to start with. One year later the first boat sailed to bring care to the Assamese, and until today, 14 more followed. The project was eventually joined by the state, which established a public-private partnership with the trust and started funding the offered service. Each month around 20.000 people in total are reached by these facilities.Some of the doctors who joined the ships helped to improve their service. One of the keys to success is frequency - by ensuring that each island is visited at least once a month it is possible to take good care of immunization and condition of pregnant women. They also bring the basic medicine, which is cheap in India - but if one needs to hire a boat to get it, the costs soar.And the service provided by the boat is free - the funds provided by the state amount for 72 400 000 million rupees per year - which, after covering the costs of the boat and the staff, means that there are 480 rupees per person left. Around 5 dollars per year.More about the project here: http://www.c-nes.org/programmes/boat-clinicsPhoto comes from http://www.tehelka.com/2014/07/boat-clinics-provide-healthcare-to-3-million-people-in-assams-river-islands/
Researcher José Gómez-Márquez whose big thoughts shapes Little Devices", the lab he directs at MIT- uses toys to make affordable medical devices.The Little Devices lab takes a DIY approach to designing and building tools, mainly for healthcare.   A plastic gun can be to create an alarm that alerts nurses when a patient’s IV bag needs changing. And a box of Lego-like building blocks can be used to modify existing medical equipment in numerous ways. He creates devices that bridge the gap between absence of mechanical or electrical engineering or fundamentals of product design. Marquez talks about that toys can be the engineered piece or the mechanical bits and pieces that you can harvest and re-purpose. Gómez-Márquez happens to have the backing of MIT, yet he is joined by a large and often-unrecognized population of DIYers who are practicing low-cost innovation. Historically, the public has looked to research and development labs at multinational corporations, universities and government labs — and has grown accustomed to expensive, complicated devices used more often in elite hospitals than jungles or slums. Not surprisingly, those who make DIY medical devices encounter doubt and even derision constantly. Such attitudes are a problem, because the DIY tools dreamed up by backyard inventors, part-time tinkerers and academics like Gómez-Márquez could improve — and even save — thousands of lives everywhere, not only in inner cities but in communities everywhere. We need to toss out our false assumptions about how, and where, new ideas come from — and recognize that innovation is everywhere.Interesting video :  https://vimeo.com/43909074
The MacArthur Foundation has decided to deliver a mighty push to fixing the world’s most hairy, entangled, unfixable problems.The idea is to look hard for a promising organisation, one that has the tenacity and creativity to provide a real solution to a problem (almost any problem is eligible). They will provide the resources: a whopping 100 million dollars.We have been thinking hard about the problem of providing high-quality, affordable health and social care to all. We think we have a candidate solution: provision of care services by communities equipped with open source knowledge and technology. From where we stand, these communities deliver services that are based on modern science (like those provided by the state and the private sector), yet they retain low overhead and human touch (like those provided by traditional communities).This is more than just an idea. We have already connected with tens of initiatives out there, and we suspect there are hundreds, possibly thousands more. We are already seeing a lot of interaction and knowledge sharing happening: we think this could be the beginning of a cycle of prototyping-sharing results- improving-prototyping. With sustained support, this cycle could result in an ecosystem of care services building on a shared body of open knowledge and tech – and be ready to deploy at scale before our present care systems collapse.So, here’s what we want to do. We want to apply for the 100 million dollar grant, with this solution. But not alone. We volunteer to coordinate a “decentralized application”, with hundreds of communities, and organizations large and small, a swarm of solution providers working on a cloud of problems related to the provision of health and social care.We think we will win. Why? Because decentralization is, simply, a superior approach. Consider:We will deploy much more brainpower than competitors. There are more people in the many communities around care than in any organisation: almost every human has been, at some point, both a care giver and a care receiver. We are all experts, we all have something to contribute.We will use more effectively the brainpower that we do have. Organisations are, by definition, hierarchies: funding one means empowering a small group at the top (senior management, possibly a research group here) to issue the orders for the rest of the organisation to execute. With us, almost everybody is at the top, almost everybody is thinking creatively around her particular corner of the care problem.We are better at learning, because more of us are teachers. Centralised projects maintain coherence via concentration of power and hierarchy. But decentralised ones cannot do that, and they have to rely on knowledge sharing and documentation. With many units collaborating on sharing knowledge and competing (with the world outside, and sometimes with each other) on implementation of care services, you get a highly interconnected network of practitioners. And these networks learn fast: we now have evidence that sociality in access to knowledge and teaching produces better technology than individual smarts. In Edgeryders alone, we have 5,300 documented sharing knowledge relationships.We are more diverse – and diversity trumps ability. Large, entangled problems tend to be badly defined, so that we are not even sure what kind of expertise will help solving them – it’s a bit like having a car that won’t start, and you don’t know whether the problem is mechanical, electric, electronic or the car is simply out of fuel. In this case, assembling a team of the best mechanics you can find is a risky strategy, because the problem might turn out to be electric after all, and no mechanic, no matter how good, has the right skills and tools to solve it. A large swarm of initiatives large and small will be vastly more diverse than an organisation (the Edgeryders community alone is present in over 30 countries).Join us. You should be involved in applying for the 100 million dollars grant as part of #OPENandChange if you are involved in a grassroots initiative that is contributing towards improved health and well-being of people using/ interacting with it. You could be an activist or social entrepreneur who got the initiative started in the first place. You could also be a researcher, but you need to have full access to the people behind the initiative.You could also be someone who appreciates the initiative and wants to support it.How to participate. In order to coordinate effectively, all participants are asked to come online in one of the weekly skype calls and tell the others about their work/ project, interact with the community here and contribute their own project planning to the collective bid.Getting started is easy! Just fill in this form (deadline September 10): http://bit.ly/29BmwxP
I'm Narindra Michel RAKOTOARISOA, I was born near of tropical forest in east of Madagascar, near by raining forest. I have an chronic asthma since when I was 2 due to a medical poisoning. My parents were there to make me extract some of it out of throat. Few days since those moments, when weather will have changing, I'm cough early 12 hours before its changing, a kind of meteorological detector :-D More than that, there were 9 people leaving in a small house of 10m2. Majority of Malagasy people we use charcoal as combustion for cooking like us. So it was more and less enough ventilated for all of us. During my childhood I was suffering of heavy breathing and lungs whistling, the fact that I lived next to a forest having fresh air and help me to overcome this asthma until my adult life. I didn't know too much people who suffer with the same illness like mine until now...More than the half of the forest in my country has been cutted for combustion, furnitures, slash and burn,... Following population growth from 15 million to 20 during the last 30 years. Public health and sanitation are trying as they can and have to keep us healthy; with this growing population; open fire and carbonic gas are growing following this, carbonic gas from factories and cars... Nowadays, 80% of kids under 5 years seem asthmatic. I know that when I was asking the pediatrician in a pediatric hospital, where I brought my 3 years old nephew for lungs exam. For information, only few people who have enough money can afford treatment like aerosol "inhale", medicines,... Rich and powerful people control the destiny and future of my country.Following this the Malagasy government has decided to stop using plastic bags last December without alternative until now. This is a good idea but the bad effect is some of our "ravinala" considered queen and symbolic tree of Madagascar is taking place of the plastic bags ; I heard a rumor that some people on our government brought back "biodegradable " plastic bag made with cassava, It's a kind of bag thick than one before. Without label or information about the factory whose made it, probably from one powerful people on the government. Other than that, without mentioning the massive destruction of large area of primary forest caused by a multinational firm mine project since 2003.Actually it's our future generations lives is on the line metaphorically and literally. Nature and man can't be separated.As my thoughts, training for peasants for new method of rice planting unsteady of slash and burn. Biogas can replace the charcoal and wood used as  combustion of 80% of Malagasy people.  Education for all and ordinance and penalties can be applied for any means of illegal way.  It's just a small sand into the gears to overcome or slow down this fast truck.Michel RAKOTOARISOA
What can you make with old plastic bottles? An way to draw cool air into homes using plastic bottles, using raw materials and the  creating a benefit to the community:here's the story:How Bangladeshi inventors are making eco-friendly air conditioners from plastic bottlesWhat can you make with old plastic bottles? A vase? A flowerpot? … an air-conditioning unit? Believe it or not, you can. When inventor Ashis Paul came up with an innovative way to draw cool air into homes using plastic bottles, his whole company got on board to help teach people living in rural Bangledesh to do the same. Since February this year, they’ve helped people to install these units-- which don’t need electricity to function-- in more than 25,000 households in developing areas of the country.“Most people live in tin huts… in the summer, it’s like being in sauna in the Sahara”Jaiyyanul HuqJaiyyanul Huq is a creative director with the Grey Group, the advertising company that spearheaded this social project.  We are a flood-prone nation, so in rural Bangladesh, most people build their homes out of tin, instead of mud. About 70% of Bangladesh's population lives in these homes. But the problem with these tin huts is that they get unbearably hot in the summer, especially in northern and central Bangladesh. I’ve been in these huts. It’s like being in a sauna in the Sahara.    One of our creative supervisors, Ashis Paul, started thinking about ways to bring relief to these people. He was turning it over in his mind when one day, he overheard his daughter’s physics tutor explaining to her how gas cools when it expands quickly. Ashis has an "inventor" mentality and he’s always been fascinated by science. So, he started experimenting.    He told us about his idea of making an air-conditioner out of plastic bottles. The simplicity of the Eco-Cooler is incredible.   Ashis Paul designed the Eco cooler. How to Make an Eco-Cooler   To make an Eco-Cooler, you cut plastic bottles in half and then mount them on a board.   Then, you place the board over a window, with the bottlenecks facing towards the inside of the house.   The change in pressure that occurs when air enters the wider part of the bottle and comes out through the bottleneck cools the air. It seems uncanny, but the principle is simple. Blow on your hand with your mouth wide open. The air feels hot, doesn’t it? Now, blow on your hand with your lips pursed. It feels like a cool breeze.The Eco-Cooler doesn’t require any electricity to function!    "We finalised it just as the weather was getting hot"   The Eco-Cooler can decrease the temperature by 5°C immediately. When it goes from 30°C to 25°C, I can tell you that it makes a difference.    The Grey group decided to take it on as a pro-bono project. We like to give back -- it’s core to our company. We decided to make and distribute these units for free. We designed the first prototype in March last year and finally finalised it at the end of February this year. That’s just when the weather starts getting hot in Bangladesh.    “The streets here are littered with bottles, so the raw materials are easy to find”   To distribute the Eco-Coolers, we teamed up with Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd. because they work in a lot of villages in Bangladesh [Editor’s note: Grameen Intel is social business platform that’s a partnership between NGO Grameen and the company Intel]. We sent our teams out to the villages where Grameen Intel works to teach people how to make our Eco-Coolers.        The beauty of it all is how easy these units are to make. First of all, the raw materials are easy to find: people don’t recycle here, so the streets are littered with bottles. We show people how to make them and then ask them to both do it on their own and to teach others. We also made a how-to pdf that’s up on our website and includes an easy step-by-step process.   It’s free and people get immediate results!
I've been thinking recently about how healthcare and 'the arts' can be encouraged to feed more symbiotyically.There has been a strong push recently in the UK to encourage performing and visual arts to engage more broadly with the themes of care, the body, medical ethics and mental health.Part of this has come through the breakdown of the traditional models of funding (National, Regional, Local Council) and a reliance on charitable funding models (Lottery funding, Arts Council, Creative Europe) as well as individual foundations. One of these, The Wellcome Trust (https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding) funds areas of the arts that reach into public engagement and arts fields as ways of improving health.I wondered if there was an opportunity for Edgeryders to develop a grant that brought together the OpenCare strand with those of us on the cultural side (not that we're really that separate) as a way of developing something (perhaps a offline public engagement project) that can feed into the strands being developed around mental health improvement.There are certainly studies that show that engagement with the arts have a sustained and positive benefit on all aspects of mental health, and i've also seen brilliant theatre work that works across a variety of disciplines.There are a few platforms out there that allow us to engage with similarly interested parties in the field. http://thesickofthefringe.com/ - provides a platform for finding new work that supports companies developing and showcase work in this area. I'm in Edinburgh during the festivals this summer, so i would be able to start a dialogue with them and see if they were interested in encouraging people to feed into an ER project.It's all flimsy thought stuff at the moment, but i thought i'd share.

Hi everyone! This is my very first post here. I've been following the platform for a little while now (around 1 year) and I am still being amazed by your productivity and shared knowledge. I am currently working for Leeuwarden-Fryslân European Capital of Culture 2018 as part of the communication and marketing team, where I'm looking into setting up an online platform on which the communities surrounding our cultural programme can join forces and find eachother. This 'looking into' has developed into the subject of my bachelor thesis for the course Media and Entertainment Management. In my research, I'm specifically looking into the interactions that take place on co-creative platforms and the dialogue between the organisation behind the platform and its users. Now, I know that with you guys the ownership of the platform itself is a lot more open than with a crowdsourcing platform such as, say, +Acumen or OpenIDEO. What you're doing builds more on the concept of open-source rather than crowdsourcing, and you're implementing it in every single part of your operation. Doing this with challenges that relate to society and that are produced because of an intrinisic motivation is very impressive! Most other platforms that try to achieve change or develop new concepts do this based on streamlined extrinisic motivations, such as Kickstarter's rewards or simply a cash prize for the best idea. Thus, I would really like to use Edgeryders as a case-study for my thesis. I'm looking for at least two users of the platform to answer a few of my questions over Skype. The questions that I have are based on two models. Firstly, I am trying to find indicators for the quality of the interactions that take place on the platform based on the framework of Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2004) and, secondly, I am trying to create some insight into your overall co-creation activities based on a recent model of Malmelin and Villi (2015).       Even if you're not willing to be interviewed over Skype, it would be very helpful to me if you could describe how and why you are making use of the platform, and to which categories your activities on the platform fit or don't fit. Also, if you have any questions, tips, ideas, or remarks about everything I've told you so far or regarding the possible platform for Leeuwarden-Fryslân 2018, please let me know!

Where we started OpenCare is a very particular research for both its topic and its modality. It wants verify the potentialities of collective intelligence and of a radical open approach to the topic of care. Coherently with that, the definition of precise research questions (and related methodologies) has not been given a priori, but will emerge steps by step from the same research-related activities (as opposed to what happens with the standard research methodologies).Given that (that, by the way, is what makes OpenCare so interesting for me), I think that the positive tension towards understanding  where we are and where we are gong should be continuous and should be monitored step by step. On the basis of this tension research questions should be progressively better defined considering: the general research question where we started form, the commitment with UE, the first  ideas that are  emerging and, last but not least, a better understanding of who we are and what are the knowledge, skills and experiences we can use. Shared visions and languagesOn the basis of the discussion I think, that, at least for who expressed themselves (see later, item 5), we agreed on these points: 1. The open care systems is an ecosystems: an environment where, in its best conditions, different care-related entities can emerge, live and thrive. These entities are very diverse in nature. They can be: care encounters, networks of care, enabling systems, different kinds of infrastructures, policies, norms, norms, ... ). An ecosystem cannot be designed but can be enriched introducing new caring entities (with the double goal of offering more opportunities for both the caregivers and the care receivers, and for incising its systemic resilince.2. The OpenCare croup and community specificity is that we deal with open care ecosystems having a particular experience and credibility on issue related to "collective intelligence and radical open approach application" (and not of care issues per se).  Given that we should orient our community's discussion on topics that coudl be defined like that: which problems and the opportunities arise when "collective intelligence and radical open approach" are applied to and issue as "care".3. Discussing about openness applied to care issues, we have two main dimensions:the openness in the processes thanks to which enabling systems (i.e the enabling products, services, places, infrastructures) are designed and realizedthe openness of care-related services in use (i.e. the openness of the network of care created around the delivery of a service).Both these dimensions are important and could be considered separately. Nevertheless, it could also be very interesting to consider the interactions between the two. 4. Given what has been said in the point 2. and 3. an emerging research question could be: How and how much the openness of a design and production process influences the openness of service delivery. And vice versa. Hopefully, other research questions, similar in nature to this one, will emerge.5. In my view, the workshop participants who express themselves should agree with these 4 previous assumptions: can we ask them?The problem is that, at least half of the participants did not  openly expressed themselves. And this seems to me a bad signal. What ca we do to stimualte their opinion?
Besides the food, there is a whole chunk of attention devoted solely to climate change. As @Pavlos said, since he was a kid he saw degradation all around - his little coastal hometown, in North-Eastern Greece, surrounded by olive orchards, was always the reference point of a good life in a good space. Seeing the country devastated by urban sprawl, beaches consumed by villas and bars, and people being happy about this, worried him since a long time. So, after receiving education in Scotland, Germany, and researching native tribes of China and Thailand, he didn't only come back to Greece to rethink its food culture. He also decided to work on the climate. Pavlos is involved with climatetracker.org, an international team of young writers and quite possibly the biggest environmental youth movement of people from all around the world. These are decentralized and nonhierarchical groups led by activists in the Carribean, Europe, Latin America. They cover events in UN or COPs but also do investigative journalism on a local scale. Their work unmasks lobbies and harmful practices and has been published in key media across the globe. They also organize webinars and campaigns and often encourage writers to concentrate on a certain issue in a given period of time. And Pavlos has an idea. Greece can become a hotspot of international dialogue on sustainability and resilience. As the country struggles with, as Pavlos has beautifully put it, "restoring the zombie economy", it innovates and experiments along the way. The social innovation and solidarity, however highly spontaneous and uncoordinated, are the backbone for the change. What would be necessary now is to organize those in collaboration with the right minds from all over the world in order to use the whole potential of this change and build a national economy that is regenerative and sustainable? Even though Greek politicians and intellectuals in many cases seem stuck decades ago and their resistance to change is huge, what's happening around proves its inescapable. Pavlos thinks the best for them would be to funnel the energy into protecting marginalized groups, including the refugees, to lower their costs of transition. The Greek crisis has a side that not many people talk about - how would paying back the debt affects its environment. Pavlos believes paying off the money lent from the international institutions would create a huge ecological debt in terms of lack of sustainable land use and waste management. Now, as the demos has been neglected and their voice hijacked during the last referendum, it's time to accept, at least tolerate, widespread civil disobedience that will drive the movement. 62% that disagreed has been silent so far, but it will have to speak soon. Even more, what seems to be an alternative idea, is not alternative anymore there - it's the only way out. Greece is exploring the open data tools and sharing knowledge, prototyping new was of accountability, transparency, decision making. And here the health and care appear again. Pavlos has seen plenty of interesting and viable practices and conclusions forming from the bottom-up, grassroots practice in Greece. These are the ways in which delivering health care has changed, in which social organization has challenged the systemic shortcomings. From those experiments and pieces emerges a complex, wide image of more inclusive future. It is built on the exchange of ideas and practices in an open manner. It rethinks the way we deliver care in a more decentralized way, more concentrated on prevention. It reframes urban food systems by educating people on the impact of what they eat on their health. Contemporary lifestyle jeopardizes 50 years of development in the health sector - food related diseases, new viruses, climate change, they all have a huge, negative impact on the quality of our lives. Technology and science, accompanied by open data and sharing, can prevent disastrous effects of those phenomena. Finally, I asked how would he explain his entrepreneurial path to those opposing the market? He said a couple of things I find hilarious and worth considering. First of all, that activism is for city people - while he wanted to go back to his olive groves and do the farm life. Secondly, there is a dire need of changing the way people do business - in a sustainable way, with respect to diversity, with a different concept of what's valuable. It's not the price of land and potential golf courses, not the cheap fast forest. Thirdly, doing things like bread plates is not a rocket science - but if successful it points towards effective and regenerative entrepreneurship. Therefore, an entrepreneur doing such kind of work realizes the visions of an activist - by actually convincing a chain of restaurants to deliver local, better coffee or beer, by cutting off the middlemen. It means millions of people affected in a positive way. It takes a solid ethical concept and guts to take risks, but it pays off in many ways. And it fills the unemployment gap, which wastes the potential of a whole generation now. Interacting with the system is the way for Pavlos. And I really like the fact he's not used to failing. You can read the first part of the article here: https://edgeryders.eu/en/transforming-food-systems-in-post-crisis-greece-conversation-with
An experiment to encourage spontaneous creativity for making a living as a migrantA short brief of what we have been working on so far is this.With the many organizations already working with refugees in Berlin, we still felt a need for an approach from a different angle and also with a different focus:Most projects for refugees are designed to specifically help the arriving families, children and the single travelling women; but the majority of refugees is barely taken care of in the same manner: the young men. It is an illogical equation: The young male refugees are often regarded as healthy and fit, able to work and therefore are not treated as a priority in terms of care. However; of what use could these benefits be if there is nothing to do? In Germany, refugees are not allowed to pick proper work for the first three months of their stay. After that period, a working permit is needed to apply for a job. The permit, however, is only granted if the person is no longer living in a refugee camp. Needless to say, the said three months often pass without anything really happening and three months slowly turn into six months and into a year - during which there is nothing to do.We are currently working at the Internationales Congress Centrum (ICC) in Berlin- a former congress center that has recently been turned into a refugee camp. Even with the circumstances being unfavourable, the atmosphere at the ICC is quite the opposite: The interaction between the refugees and the staff and security is remarkably free and friendly. Volunteers playing with children; refugees and security joking around and everybody is eating at the same table. There is no hint of the provider/receiver-dilemma that you would witness in other establishments. We’ve been warmly welcomed by the people and the relationships have gradually grown more personal since our first visit.The place is led by the Malteser; we were shown around the place by one of their very nice volunteers. She then introduced us to a room of eight Syrians, four of which were ready to help us in our project and provided us with insights.Besides stories over everyday rituals like tea and Syrian home traditions, we were shown the little gimmicks to improve the bare rooms where they are living in at the moment: How they pulled out screws and nails from the walls to make clothing hooks; how you make a wall-mounted phone holder with just duct tape and a piece of wood; where to store the food; they showed us how they hack the beds to create more privacy and how to shield the light falling onto the upper beds with merely pieces of wood and a blanket to a point where one could create an entire ceiling with just white cloth.We learnt quickly that the ideas of how to use the space could never occur to someone who has never been in that exact position: It was evident that they know best about the needs and necessities in their very situation and environment.With the creative potential, the only problem lies in the lack of tools and materials. To see what would happen if material were available, we made a little experiment where we brought basics like duct tape, cable ties, string and durable cardboard and looked what they would think of building intuitively. Despite scepticism in the beginning, it was beautiful to witness the moment when everyone in the room joined to figure out the best construction for a wall-mounted shelf, built with mortise and tenon joints. The fact the project was dealt with in such a manner, shows the willingness to engage these kinds of challenges with seriousness and a certain claim to quality and that it is not only about practicality and pure function, for such a shelf could have been easily assembled withjust tape and cardboard. It was fun for us to join the working process and thinking with them about the construction and making, but more importantly, it was fun for them to be challenged in making something useful and to make that beautifully. Mohammed, who came up with the idea of using joinery, later joked saying he would love to make such shelves for the whole camp - and we hoped, it was not merely a joke, but a mentality that we could continue to work with. In fact, we left all the spare materials in their rooms and by our next visit they had built another two shelves and a small storage for clothes under one of the beds.Work in progress: Building a shelf  Image above: One of the shelves that Mohammed made after we left.Mohammed’s mentality is exactly what we we’re looking for. The question is if more people in the camp would share the same enthusiasm. Ideally, a craftsman could be found to take the role of a tutor to guide the others into the basics of building. On our last visit in the camp we learnt that the the camp’s organizers are taking help of one of the refugees who used to be a tailor. He now has his working space (a table with a sewing machine) at the intern clothes depot and helps fixing the garments before they’re given out.We feel the answer to our problem lies in establishing and expanding that very concept in other camps as well - to involve people in the daily happenings and motivate them to do what they can do best. We will research the willingness amongst the refugees to join such a program as soon as soon as Ramadan is over.Our plan to help people improving their living situation by building their own furniture is a first step in that direction. We are working on a solution that doesn´t require proffessional skills or tools, but motivates people and gives them the feeling of doing something useful for them and the community. To establish this first step we are going to launch a fundraising campaign on StartNext in the next weeks and we are happy about any kind of support! If you have suggestions or similiar/different experiences: please share!  So we can make this happen, as good as possible :) The production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.
It was a long, very interesting talk with Pavlos.We started with the reason why our meeting was delayed - and that was the first narrative of care I found in this hour-long discussion.The reason was food, or to be more precise - Maiolica, a new restaurant in Sifnos. Georgiadis has been involved with his company "We Deliver Taste" (http://wedelivertaste.com) in consulting the place, crafting the menu, making it local, affordable, Mediterranean. Their consultancy for food businesses connects small producers from all over Greece, trying to change the hospitality landscape in the country. Part of the idea is to tell people about the ingredients, the element of storytelling, which changes customers' relations to the product, and the gastro-landscape of the country.Pavlos is an ethnobotanist and for 12 years he devoted his career to science, researching for his Ph.D. in Thailand and China. He left this path four years ago to invest time and energy in agrifood and environment - the brainchild of this transition is We Deliver Taste, a company that investigates the food system, from seed to stomach, in which he was joined by two Italians and a Czech. They are not only interested in the processes that bring the food to our tables, but also in the cultures surrounding it, especially the Mediterranean dining customs and love for good food. In one of the side projects, funded by Horizon 2020, they're also concentrating on reforming the digital aspect of the food business by preparing pilot, open data systems, tools and applications that will make the path from the farmer to the customer/industry (hospitals, hotels) more clear, while at the same time keeping people informed and educated about the content of their plate. By this multilayered, multifaceted enterprise Pavlos wants to change the paradigm. He believes that if the way we think about the time and space of food, meaning the time spent on preparation, growth, the human experience of food, it will have an impact on climate resilience, climate justice, biodiversity, water and soil conservation and will boost regenerative economies in rural areas. Pavlos targets people in their 50-ties and 60-ties, those who have access to power and money, and believes that educating and informing them is crucial to driving the change. He consciously chose to become part of the market, be open for collaboration with government, and get involved with huge public procurement systems because he thinks demonizing the market is wrong. And because there is a dire need for change there. After years of scaling and working for their position, We Deliver Taste are now in serious talks with important actors. On a smaller scale, there is an idea of creating an edible dish which could be used in the refugee camps. It's not that the idea is brand new, there are some Indian startups that have crowdfunded and done it already - but it's that importing such a product would be counterproductive. Instead, Pavlos wants to recreate the whole system necessary for producing such a dish - an industrial designer who'd made the moulds, a baker, ideally struggling to survive in the market, a flour producer, etc. He also dreams of a website that would accompany this project. One could see there how much profit it created for the parties involved, work saved on waste management and how many refugees it catered. Besides, he wants to create a crowdfunding campaign to donate money to biodegradable plastic producers in Italy, who'd, later on, provide their product to the refugee camps in Greece. The stake is huge - 60.000 refugees, 2 meals a day, which makes a 100.000 dishes a day, and it will happen for years as maybe even a half of them will stay in Greece for longer. That would fix the existing problem of waste and even produce compost in large communal digestors to feed the organic agriculture and parks. "We have to enter this market fast and with confidence right now. There is not much time for discussions - it's somehow already too late".  The second part of the discussion coming briefly. 
Monday's 4:30 PM CET call is dedicated to organizing a tour to discover care stories and protagonists!OpenCare is a global effort to bring together the many, less heard voices of caregivers and caretakers. It started in the beginning of 2016, and now over 100 brilliant people joined from all over, people who contribute to fixing things that are broken: hostility to migrants, European welfare, closed healthcare systems, and more.We meet online and engage with our personal stories, but mostly we are humans and would enjoy real life support and smiles too.. just look back at where we kickstarted this!Op3n Meetups Adventure is where we make it easier for people all over to contribute to a global care debate, share their story and pool together experiences to discover solutions.When is it happening? Between July - September.Where is it happening? All over Europe and beyond.Op3n Meetups are for:People with an idea, story, technology or proposal about community care People who wish to understand and join OpenCare, but can’t or won’t do so on the website Facilitators and conveners who like to brain ache around big issues in cosy gatherings   Where does it all go? We will collectively build a bid for 100 Million USD to fix the care crisis! See MacArthur Foundation’s call for projects at 100andChange.org (more about this in a few days).What’s the plan? In our next community call on Monday 4 PM CET we look at where we can go, who can drive this and what resources are available! Leave a comment with what you are interested in and we’ll discuss it on Monday. Everyone and anyone is welcome to join, we’re meeting here:https://meet.jit.si/opencare
Support the Shit Show on Startnext! startnext.com/theshitshowWe have been studying it for 3 months, we have been dealing with it most of our life, we are highly aware of the importance of engaging with it but we still find it incredibly hard to talk about.Pauline and I are both product design students and together with Nele and Luisa who study communications we are team UP. In the context of "Hacking Utopia", a human centered design project at the University of Arts Berlin, we are investigating mental health. This article explains our approach of boosting mental resilience and give you the chance to get involved in our project.In our previous contributions on Edgeryders we described how we started off with the question of making sadness, unproductivity and inefficiency less shameful. We discovered two TED talks that influenced us greatly: The power of vulnerability by Brene Brown and Depression, the secret we share by Andrew Solomon. As later confirmed by the psychologists we interviewed, these talks made us understand that sharing our feelings is a key step towards mental resilience. Establishing a sustainable, personal connection this is necessary for recovery and growth. When we hide our condition, we ignore it, it becomes worse.USER INTERVIEWSThe issue of mental health is especially important in the context of youth. Young adults are increasingly affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Their circumstances make them particularly susceptible to psychological stress. As many leave the familiar framework of home and school and move into an uncertain future, the newly independents have to find alternative support structures. New living situations, potentially in a new city or even country, starting university or a job, all these developments entail a multitude of mental pressures. In a time where social media is so influential, standards of self-representation are an added factor. According to one of the psychological guidance counsellors at Studentenwerk Berlin; stress, loneliness and self-image issues are very common results among many students.As part of our research, we interviewed several university students from different backgrounds about negative emotions like these. One question was how they handle situations of feeling sad, stressed or lonely. The main insight was that everyone experienced this shit, but no one liked to deal with it. A prominent theme in the conversations was the difficulty to talk about emotional problems – be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder. It was mentioned that it was easier for them to open up to someone who had similar problems and could empathize. However, it is difficult to identify the people that can offer support when everyone tries to hide their struggles.As a result, most people don’t decide to seek help until they had been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Yet at this point of outreach, recovery is still far. As we learned from our interviews, it can take months to find care that is suitable to the individual and more months to see any progress. While there is a great spectrum of available options, the general idea of psychological treatment is still stigmatized. It is often not even perceived as a possible solution. The psychologists we interviewed mentioned that many of their patients came to them only after being referred by a general practitioner or friends who had tried therapy themselves.Yet, we cannot force people to seek help. Keeping quiet about insecurities is a justified mental defence mechanism. When we share our feelings, we are vulnerable, exposed. Oftentimes, the recipient is simply not equipped to offer a good, empathic response. This could almost be described as a societal incompetence, stemming from a general lack of awareness.OUR GOALWe want to challenge the current attitude towards psychological care. Our project tries to de-stigmatize psychological pain and make the sensitive, 'taboo' issue of mental health more present and approachable to the public. We believe that udnerstanding and empathy is vital to provide good care for people that are suffering from emotional distress. We want to make it clear that feeling shitty is nothing to be ashamed of, but actually a very common thing. Also, we want the impact of these feelings to be understandable, so that more people can offer informed, helpful responses. When this happens, the threshold of reaching out is lowered, which in return allows problems to be addressed before they develop into serious mental conditions.INSPIRATIONThere are a number of inspiring projects who deal with exactly this issue of awareness. One clever way artists are spreading awareness is over the internet. Tumblr users like Rubyetc, Beth Evans or Sarah’s Scribbles have gained quite a following with their funny, relatable comics about everyday struggles. Seeing that you are not alone in your suffering can be very comforting. Recently, illustrator Gemma Correll created a series of drawings as part of an online awareness campaign for Mental Health America to visualize what #mentalillnessfeelslike. Their campaign encourages people to open up about their conditions and harvest the power of sharing.A related approach can be found in the various devices that exist to simulate old age. Suits like ‘GERT’ are designed to make the wearer feel the impairments that come with aging: stiffness and limited mobility, decreasing strength, blurred sight, muffled hearing. The concept was originally developed to enable caretakers of elderly people to better understand the needs and fears of their patients. Now, gadgets with similar effects, designed by students at Weimar University, are being exhibited at the Hygiene Museum in Dresden, allowing the public to gain the same understanding.  In general, public exhibitions are a valuable source of inspiration when it comes to reaching people and conveying information. A prime example is the 'Happy Show', set up by design firm Sagmeister & Walsh. Verging somewhere between art and education, the show throughly explores the theme of happiness in a graphic, creative and interactive manner. Another show that encourages people to actively engage with the exhibit is Erwin Wurms 'Bei Mutti'. Visitors are isntructed to interact the artefacts on display, effectively becoming a piece of the art themselves.PROJECT PROPOSALIn order to achieve our goal we propose a combination of an interactive exhibition and an information booth. This pop-up stall can easily be set up at universities events like open days and conferences.We will exhibit various sadness simulators, wearable objects for the crowd to try which simulate the effects of being depressed, stressed or anxious. These objects have been inspired by an online survey we have conducted in order to find out how people physically feel when they are in emotional distress. Out of dozens of responses we have extracted the most common themes: weight on the shoulders, head pulling down, brain fog and a general discomfort in one's body feeling: hot, sticky and itchy. With these results we have designed various objects: A neck bender, a very heavy device to carry on his back being forced to lean forward. A helmet made of tinted transparent acrylic that simulates looking through a veil and muffles the sound of the surroundings and a really uncomfortable ill-fitting coat made of a super itchy and stiff fabric. We have more ideas but for now we have realized these three.Those who are brave enough to test our simulators will receive a positive feedback. They will get to choose between 3 gifts: Stickers that encourage everyday task such as: "got out of bad", "took a shower" and "washed my laundry" in order to demonstrate how difficult these tasks can be to certain people. They could also choose comforting cynical tea bags that they can grant a friend in need on a rainy day or shit shaped chocolate pralines to compensate for the horrors they have just been through. The exhibition will also include an interactive board in which participants can share their feelings caused by the simulators or just generally and a second board presenting useful information regarding mental issues: how to identify, approachable treatments, support groups and other solutions. The first exhibition will take place during Berlin University of the Arts Semester end's exhibition and we hope it will continue to other universities around berlin and even in other cities in Europe.If you hope so as well you are welcome to join us in a number of ways:1. Support our Startnext campaign going online July 20th! Help us fund the first ever Shit Show and enjoy our moody merchandise (link tba)2. Spread the word! Our first intention is to raise awareness of mental health issues. Please share our ideas and solutions, you might even help someone.(It will also be nice if you would share our Startnext campaign once it's up :)3. Participate our research, tell us how you feel when you are down in our survey or just share with us your Ideas and comments.

This is a story how a new initiative Soundsight Training promises help for blind and visually impaired gain more mobility and independence.The website for Soundsight Training is http://www.soundsight.ch Developing a technology that could sense and reconstruct reality for blind people can be one approach. But, a technology that enables blind and vision impaired to mediate their perception of their environment and interact with their surroundings is actually empowering then to be independent from aid devices.Many blind and partially sighted people of all ages are unable to lead independent lives because they are not getting the support they need. The needs of people who lose their sight are many and varied and the support provided must be personalized if it is to meet individual needs. Teaching the blind to see with hearing using echolocation would be a way to make the largest impact, beyond the use of sight.  The benefits of acquiring this skill changes the way you interact with your surroundings on a daily basis. It decreases limitations and opens the door to new opportunities.The Journey beginsIrene Lanza, Management Engineer, CEO of SoundSight Training, knows it’s possible. Irene came in contact with the Scimpulse Foundation while participating in the Challenge Based Innovation program of Ides2quare at CERN in Geneva. The challenge was to design something that enabled blind people to perceive the surrounding environment. It was then the idea was planted.  Many opted for a mobile device approach, something else called the attention of Irene. Teaching the blind to echolocate themselves?Through this experience, Irene had the opportunity to interact with the visually impaired. Through working with mothers of blind children and getting to hear their stories, setbacks and concerns the more Irene wanted to do something to support and empower them. Guidance of blind and visually impaired people is a clear unmet need. However, most blind and visually impaired people want to go out and enjoy independent mobility.The environment in which we live is becoming increasingly complex. Even a journey across a city  requires a range of skills including being able to avoid obstacles on the pavement, to walk in the right direction, play a sport and the list goes on. These tasks may seem trivial, but for someone with a vision impairment, this is a challenge and a skill that needs to be learned. SoundSight enables the development of a hearing talent that compensates for the missing eyesight.See With Sound SoundSight Training was developed to enable the blind to see with sound. Together, with Henrik Kjeldsen and Dr. Marco Manca the first prototype of an echolocation training system, was created. It’s a virtual reality environment based on audio. The training is completed with practice in the real world until the student becomes fully independent from the simulation. Further explanation of how can be found here. SoundSight attracted the attention of the Italian government and a number of organisations and advocates that offered its support.  Among them were, Cecilia Camellini, Champion Paralympic Swimmer. When asked what she thought of SoundSight, “with training and effort athletes can improve performance.”  Experience the world more independentlySoundSight Training is a spinoff of the Let Me See Project, the first from the ScimPulse Foundation  I.M.mortal research program. It was a 3 year journey that started from a workshop and now partners with governmental organizations to impulse the idea forward beyond the prototype stage. Now it has its own heartbeat. SoundSight Training designed to helping people explore the world more independently.“This software has the potential to enrich the lives of people who are blind and visually impaired. Everyone can learn this skill, it’s accessible to everyone and when we design for greater accessibility, everyone benefits.” says Irene Lanza.   Improving performance, challenging yourself, to overcome limitations, all of this effects humanity’s growth, expansion and well-being. The challenges for the visually impaired are enormous, so immense are the ramifications for those now living without sight, and so exciting is the initiative on the horizon.For more information about SoundSight initiative, please visit www.soundsight.ch
I've been suffering from MS since 1999 and it is 7 years since I have experienced dropped foot problem. My left foot doesn't work properly and I've kept on stumbling. In 2011 the Italian NHS provided me with a plastic device, called MOLLA DI CODIVILLA, that is used to mantain my foot up.It is rigid and the foot cannot move: it is like putting your foot in plaster cast. So your muscles don't work anymore and it is not easy to put it in shoes.I couldn't bear it and I started surfing the net to look for other solutions.I found out the functional electrical stimulator : FES. It is largely used in England, Germany, USA but in Italy.It is a device that, thanks to 2 electrodes put on the peroneal muscle, a light switch pasted under your shoe sole and a little electric box gives the electrical impulse to your muscle so your foot can actually move without dropping, giving you a more natural gait.The advantages are that you can put the switch easily in every shoe and the muscle is stimulated so it remains active. I found out different ways to wear the FES putting the little box on boots, under the knee and in the jeans pocket, so I can wear sandals, boots, skirt or even bikini, even with the FES.I use the Odstock Medical one, provided by the Salisbury hospital (UK).I also tried the German Ottobock and the Ness, but I think they are too big and you cannot change the place of the electrodes at your convenience according to how you would need your foot to move.With Ottobock and Ness the medic pastes the electrodes on a support that you put around your calf.
After a very long research phase me and my team from Newcomer now have conceptualized a smartphone-app, which familiarizes not only refugees but any newcomers with their environment. Our team is working in the Hacking Utopia project at UDK (University of Arts) in Berlin. We are two product designers and two communication students.Main target group are refugees why we mostly talked to young men from syria. Of course they are facing a lot of problems and some are probably more serious tha the one we are trying to solve. We found out that -waiting for german bureaucracy to give them the needed papers and learning german- a lot of them feel lost in their new environment. Although our focus is on refugees Newcomer is for everyone, who is new in the city.Our App combines different types of challenges in a city-rally taking place in Berlin. They make them explore the town and talk to people. So for exapmple it asks them to take a photo of something, that reminds them of their origin. Also we are inviting Institutions like Bars, Cafés and Eventspaces be a part of our project. So for example we lead a participant to a café and ask him to drink a coffee with someone. Both drinks are half priced so they get in contact by using this discound. With a growing community different app-users could match and meet to solve tasks together and have a nice experience.So our app definitely is no tourist guide. It is more like a motivation-tool to go out and socialize. In two weeks we are starting a crouwdfunding-campaign on start next. Until then we clarify our concept and test it with people. If you have questions or suggestions please feel free to comment.Milan/Newcomer
I am Sabina Ulubeanu, a 36 years old mother who also like to describe herself as „ just a composer”.In the autumn of 2009, at 30, I suddenly began to feel sick: very weak, short of breath and I became yellow. My daughter was 7, and my son was 2. I was still breastfeeding and thought I was just tired and stressed out.What came next was an avalanche of investigations and meetings with doctors form many hospitals. After ruling out all sorts of terrible diseases and trying different treatments with no success, I went to Vienna where my condition was confirmed: Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. The newest drug for AIHA (Rituximab)  was still not approved in Romania for this rare disease, so I basically moved to Vienna where thet gave it to me, with no positive outcome, and finally I had my spleen removed and got well.It happened in  March 2012.In November 2012 I was again in Vienna for artistic reasons (and the usual check-up). This is when I read for the first time about the Network of Cytostatics. Everything was familiar to me: the oldest pharmacy in Vienna, the office above Mariahilferstr, but mostly, the struggle to regain one's health....It was too soon for me to get involved, tha trauma was too recent. But in February 2013, a good friend, Simona Tache, shared on Facebook a status about needing someone going to Bucharest from Vienna. It clicked something inside me and I responded. What came next was overwhelming. Yes, I travelled home with medicine, calmly taking them through security and bringing them to Valeriu, the taxi driver that distributed them to the ones in need. More important was the fact that doing a simple thing, an easy gesture, meant helping someone's health and fighting a system that seemed not to care about the people. Everyone I talked to about the network felt the same: it is the least we can do! I truly believe people have the need to do good, to offer, to help each other.The Network was a way of getting people together for a good purpose. I think it is the main reason it worked so well.It responded the needs of others, but also our own need to give (time/ help/ encouragement).My own personal gain, though, was tremendous. Not only you feel good helping others, but I became very good friends with Vlad Voiculescu, the initiator if the Network, supporting each other in many other so called impossible projects or just knowing we are there at a click or phone call away.I got involved because I knew what it means to be helpless against a disease and I will remain involved for as long as I will live, because this Network might not be needed now for cancer drugs, but it created a gathering of great souls that will be for sure needed for many other aspects of our society that need deep and profound healing.
When current regulations are obsolete, one solution may be to evade rather than to reform or abide by potentially stifling rules. Evasive entrepreneurship refers to circumventing institutional obstacles as part of novel activity. It is not illegal: it’s done by using new technologies, finding room in existing regulations or working in the gray zone. If successful, it can make the institution being sidestepped irrelevant, or even provoke reform by highlighting its inefficiency. Evasive entrepreneurship is potentially a tool that can aid institutional reform in Europe, in particular in areas where institutions are obsolete or ineffective but where political reform is slow in response.I use this framework to discuss how initiatives which stem from communities can bring about change. An example used to illustrate this is the Helliniko Metropolitan Community Clinic in Greece, a large volunteer effort which provides health care to low-income patients. The self-organized clinic referred to as the people’s “Alternative Health System” has served thousands of patients parallel to the existing (but ill functioning) health care system.All this is nothing new. Economic and social development often results from entrepreneurs responding to problems or opportunities and enacting change. While high-tech business firms are everyone’s favourite example, this entrepreneurship need not be profit-driven nor abide by existing rules.Institutional entrepreneurship refers to how entrepreneurs are influenced by and influence institutions. It is a field that greatly interest me. Entrepreneurship typically refers to business activity. More fundamentally however it includes all innovative activities aimed at change, not only firms. Other categories include “social entrepreneurs” who create non-profit organizations, “political entrepreneurs” who recombine resources in the policy arena to bring about reform and “community entrepreneurs” who organize to provide local public goods.According to Schumpeter, the defining characteristic of entrepreneurship is not earning profits but disrupting the current equilibrium – the “order of things” inherited from the past. Business entrepreneurs who change the market equilibrium with new technologies, products or organizations are one important group, but the term can be applied to other actions which bring about dynamic change.This post discusses these concepts theoretically as well as giving examples of how specific projects can be viewed within this framework.A case illustrating political entrepreneurship is the People's Assembly in Estonia, an online platform for crowdsourcing ideas for reforming electoral and political laws. The public was free to suggest proposals, which were reviewed by experts and discussed by a randomly chosen assembly of a few hundred voters. The People's Assembly was initiated and organized by civil society voluntaries dissatisfied with democratic institutions in Estonia. It uses modern IT-tools to mimic classical democratic associations in smaller polities which allowed for face-to-face discussions and open proposals.One interesting example of “community entrepreneurship” is Prinzessinnengarten, a large urban garden in the middle of Berlin founded and managed by local volunteers. The garden was built in a poorer part of Berlin to experiment with green urban gardening but also as a social initiate. Both the Prinzessinnengarten and the People's Assembly are entrepreneurial in that they are novel responses to opportunity, but clearly not business firms.Social entrepreneurship was also the driving force behind several much larger institutions. The Swiss businessman Henry Dunant is not famous for his private investments but for founding of the Red Cross, for which he received the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901. More recent example of non-profit entrepreneurs includes Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger who in 2001 created Wikipedia. The Red Cross and Wikipedia were innovative initiatives which changed the world as much as any entrepreneurial firm and which also required novel ideas, alertness to opportunities, risk taking and organizational effort.The People's Assembly, Prinzessinnengarten, The Red Cross and Wikipedia are examples of novel and to various extents disruptive entrepreneurship, but not of evasive entrepreneurship. These are examples of innovations in practices, technology or organization carried out within the existing institutional framework.Entrepreneurs act within the rules of society we call institutions, sometimes defined as “the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction”. Formal written institutions include laws, property rights and regulations whereas informal unwritten institutions include as traditions, cultural practices and norms. In the last few years there have some interesting work on how institutions affect entrepreneurs and how entrepreneurs may in turn influence institutions. I have previously written about the interaction of entrepreneurship and institutions.Institutions such as property rights, rules, market structure, the political system and social norms largely regulate society and influence the extent to which entrepreneurial talent is directed toward productive or unproductive activity. Entrepreneurs can in turn work to abide, evade or alter institutions.The common response is to institutions and work whiting the current framework. Altering institutions can take the form of social activism aimed directly at influencing policy makers to reform laws and regulations, such as the environment movement. A perhaps more intriguing way in which entrepreneurs interact with institutions is through evasive entrepreneurship aimed at circumventing formal institutions. Unlike activism, evasive entrepreneurship is not aimed directly at changing institutions by influencing policy makers but at devising ways to work around them.One example includes rides-for-hire application companies such as Uber and Lyft which enable their users to circumvent regulations in the local taxi market. Another example aimed at circumventing intellectual property right and monopoly power includes file-sharing platforms such as The Pirate Bay. An important recent study by Elert and Henrekson discusses evasive entrepreneurship in depth:“A well-established idea in the entrepreneurship literature is that entrepreneurs generally abide by institutions, which are therefore seen as the main determinants of entrepreneurship and economic growth. We challenge this idea by providing the first formal definition of evasive entrepreneurship, and argue that it is an important yet underappreciated source of innovation and change in the economy, especially because evasive entrepreneurs through their actions in the market may spur institutional change with potentially important welfare effects…This type of entrepreneurship is a means to test and provoke the existing institutional frameworks, and it also indirectly results in adaptations within those frameworks”.Social activism takes place in the policy arena and deals with unwanted institutions by creating opinion and influencing politicians to directly reforming the institution in question. Evasive entrepreneurship by contrast accepts the institution but devices method to de facto work around it in the real economy. Elert and Henrekson discuss the distinction:“Unlike institution-altering entrepreneurs, evasive entrepreneurs do not use political means to change institutions, but instead affect them through their activities in the market [...] they do not directly try to change institutions through political means at the higher levels of the institutional hierarchy”An entrepreneur who devises clever ways to evade taxes by using tax-havens may cause harmful economic effects. An early definition of evasive entrepreneurship is efforts in “evading the legal system or in avoiding the unproductive activities of other agents”. Adam Smith had this figured out already in 1776. He wrote that individuals could circumvent institutional constraints unfavorable to commerce, and added that the effort of individuals to better their condition is “not only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often encumbers its operation’’.Elert and Henrekson agree. Evasion can be both a bad and a good thing, depending on the specifics.“If evasive entrepreneurship circumvents institutions that are welfare enhancing, it is likely to decrease welfare, but if there are other motives behind these institutions or if they have become obsolete (act as impediments) due to technical and/or organizational change, evasive entrepreneurship is likely to raise welfare”.It is more likely that evasive entrepreneurship act as a vehicle of regulatory change by provoking it when the institutions being evaded is obsolete or inefficient. In these cases, evasive entrepreneurship has the additional benefit of pointing to inconsistencies in regulation.Policy-makers may indeed welcome evasive entrepreneurship in many situations. The interest of politicians and society do not always perfectly coincide, for example in settings characterized by rent seeking, corruption, lobbying or group conflict. This can lead to institutional designed to further private interests of politicians or special interests despite being ineffective for society at large. Not all institutional inefficiency is however intentional. In other cases, inefficiency reflects complexity and the fact that optimal policies constantly shift due to technological and social change. In this situation,evasive entrepreneurship palys a Hayekian role by utilizing local information that is known in communities affected by policies but which policy makers in centralized decision making do not have full access to.Another major problem in devising institutions is uncertainty, not the least when dealing with new technologies. When there are large uncertainties, evasive entrepreneurs can serve as an educational source for policy makers by demonstrating by experimenting and testing boundaries, demonstrating on a smaller scale what works and what does not. This is particularly true when there are active communities which self-organize to actively bring knowledge to the surface. In recent years, policymakers have become more aware about the benefits of using self-organized communities as a source of smalls scale experimentation and innovation as a complement for large scale for bureaucracy. Many initiatives fail, but the cost of failure is small, unlike state activity, and easily outweighed by the gains from even a few successful experiments.An example of such innovative initiatives who I recently came into contact with is the tech community Edgeryders, which experiments with open access enterprises to deal with institutional failure in Europe. One fascinating case in evasive entrepreneurship which interested me is in the Greece health care sector.Health care provision is one of the major problems facing the economy. Studies in the field of health economics has documented the difficult problem of health inflation, where expenditure on health care consistently increases faster than the rest of the economy, which puts pressure on public and private finances in both the U.S and Europe. There are however few satisfactory answers to what can be done about this.The Greek health care system in addition collapsed following the economic crisis. Edgeryders works with a very interesting case study on evasive entrepreneurship in the Greek health care sector. Health care provision in Greece faces major difficulty following the financial crisis, with brought the public to the brink of bankruptcy and in addition led to many Greeks losing their jobs in a country where the national health service is tied to employment. This led to many unemployed Greeks losing their insurance virtually lacking access to public health care and no money to pay for private clinics.One response to institutional failure was Metropolitan Community Clinic, a self-organized initiative evading existing institutions to provide health care to those lacking health care. Edgeryders write: “This is a very strange animal as health care providers go. It has no legal existence. Its literature proudly proclaims: “MCCH is a volunteer organization without Legal or Taxable status and it is not a 'Non-Profit-Making-Organisation'.” Maria: "We are technically illegal". It does not accept donations in money. It does accept donations in kind: medicines, equipment, blood sample analyses. It operates from a building that belongs to the Municipality of Helliniko-Argyropoulis. Though none of its employees works in the building, the Municipality still pays the electricity and phone bills that the MCCH generates”Traditional economic theory might in the past have concluded that this arrangement is impossible, but work in New Institutional Economics by Elinor Ostrom and others have shown that self-organized governance systems can use norms, internal trust and reciprocity even when formal structures and property rights are lacking. The MCCH may serve as an illustration of Ostrom's Law: “A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory”There are apparently several similar health-care clinics in Greece circumventing the institutional framework as a response to policy failure. I find this an interesting example of evasive entrepreneurship, and plan to evaluate the MCCH as a case of evasive entrepreneurship as a response to institutional failure together with my college Erik Lakomaa. Elert and Henrekson in their study focus on for-profit evasive entrepreneurship, but conceptually nothing precludes non-profit evasive entrepreneurship.In discussed above, the benefits of evasive entrepreneurship are particularly important in situations when existing institutions do not function well, which makes Greece a suitable case study. This and other cases are interesting to evaluating if evasive entrepreneurship may be utilized to identify, resolve or reform obsolete institutions in Europe.  Photo credit: Charles Knowles on flickr.com
On monday we met 11 year old Rosalie and her parents for a drink. During the pregnancy, Rosalie lost the frontal part of her brain. Thus she has difficulties to talk, but she understands everything. Rosi is a very attentive young girl. She has spasticity and sits in a wheelchair. The wheelchair supports her in an upright position. Rosalies parents told us, that there was no barrier-free playground when she was little. Her parents used to carry her out of the wheelchair so that she could play at the playground. Rosalies parents actually advocate this, since she was then given the opportunity to experience variety. She learned, felt and experienced things outside of her wheelchair. Apart from this, she didn't feel different from the other kids anymore. The family emphasized, that the variety and the new feeling a child gets when being or playing outside the wheelchair, is much more valuable than one might imagine. But unfortunately there is no equipment, no seats, which supports the body and ensures children with paralysis or spasticity a comfortable seat, for example while swinging. Her mother gave us the example of a beanbag chair. Thanks to its soft filling, the beanbag ensures a cozy seating and adapts to the body at once. The beanbag chair is body ergonomically.The interview and the experiences the family has already made, gave us a whole new view of needs.After a little observation and a couple of statements, we narrowed it down to the main elements, which are most popular by children in different ages: sandbox, swing, slide. We made sketches and gathered ideas of how each element could be inclusive. After adding the beanbag chair into our sketches, they led more and more into a swing.So we minimized our target group into children at the age of 2 to 10 years, due to weight and hight.Right now, we have a few ideas and sketches for a swing, in which you can sit or lay down together as two. Already existing swings inspired us, like in the pictures below.The strength of our concept is currently more on the inclusion than on accessibility. Our idea of the swing is more about togetherness and common experiences with children with and without disabilities.We could not imagine before, that inclusion and accessibility are two different topics/areas. Looking at our first idea of the playground and the current one, our current one is not barrier-free. The swing can not be used with a wheelchair. However, the current swing gives children the opportunity to experience moments outside their wheelchair, in a suitable way. 
Our last design challenge was „how might we help society to drop down social and environmental barriers, because that is what disables people.“We understood that the word society is too big in this context and we need to narrow it down. So we asked ourselves what is our target group? Where would it be most useful to start with all our gained insights? We decided to focus on children. Keeping in mind the insights we gained from Raul Krauthausen, that because of a non barrier-free environment, there won't be meetings with people with and without disabilities. This leads to prejudices and fears. It was our goal to work on accessibility in order to make meetings happen. Thus, our target is a barrier-free enviroment. In connection to children, the best place to start is the playground. On a barrier-free playground children with and without disabilities can play together and meet each other. This way we could counteract fears of contacts in an early age/stage.The idea was to give children with and without disabilities the opportunity to play together on one drive. Our goal was to develop an inclusive device, which two children with disabilities, two without or one with and one without disabilities, could use and have fun with.We started to make further interviews with kids and their children, to gain more insights in this matter.
Recently we had a telephon interview with Peter*, whos child has certain limitations. As one of three kids Fabian* grew up in a endearing family, which gives him on one side as much personal and special support and on the other side treat him like his two older brothers. Fabian lost half of his brain function after having a stroke, which lead to spastic hemiparalysis. Because of that further problems came up like a malposition of his hips and a curvature of the spine.When I met him he was full of power, running around, shaking everybodys hand and laughing. But most of the time he should sit in his wheelchair, in order to guard against swollen and painful knees. Because of a cognitive limitation Fabian is receiving all the stimuli. As we can focus on one thing and block our environment out, Fabian can not filter environmental information. That makes him most of the time an observer, someone who is rather watching than being in the focus of interest. Since one year his parents noticed an aggressivity against himself, because he starts to reflect on himself, his position and possibilties. A psychologyst told them that often kids with disabilities that are more supported are more reflecting themselves and know what limitations they have compared to kids that are not getting that well supported. Getting that special and individual support is really important for them, that's why the parents decided to send Fabian to a school for physically handicapped kids. There they will have a class with about eight kids, one teacher and one pedagog. Trained assistants with different specializations like physiotherapist, care worker or ergotherapist are working in the school as well. Peter said that inclusion or integration is the actual content and sounds good, but it does not always work, as we can see in Fabians case.And that individuality makes it even difficult on playgrounds to build it barrierfree. For Fabian, who can walk and run but not grab, force or push with his one arm, playgrounds would need to have different requirements than for other handicapped kids.Swinging is a really nice, exciting and relaxating activity. Swings with only a plank do not fit Fabian’s physical needs, since he is not able to hold himself with one arm. Laying on a birds nest swing is more easy for him.Slides are good to use in case the entrance is easy to reach. Climbing nets or round ladders makes it difficult for Fabian. Water and Sand is an interesting sensorial material, that all childs love. Playing in the mud, splashing with the water, diging holes or baking sand cakes are activities that could be on hip height and done while sitting in a wheelchair.Getting this insight from a parents view leades us more in the direction of what kids with handicappes are able to do, what they like, what they prefer and what should have been thought from another perspective. *Names changed to protect privacy
The OpenCare project has already collected incredible, humbling stories of community-driven care. We expect more, many more, to be rolling in in the coming months. But here's the catch: these stories are extremely diverse. They all do have some vague resemblance, but it is surprisingly hard to come up with a clear set of criteria to parse what is open care from what is not. For most people, open care seems to be like pornography: easy to recognize, but hard to define. This workshop attempts to shine some light on the matter, helping the OpenCare team and community converge on a shared vision of just what it is that we are studying.Practical informationThe workshop is led by @Ezio_Manzini and lasts about three hours. It is organized for the OpenCare research team, but, within reason, open to the community and the public. If you wish to participate, let us know by leaving a comment below.Location: Stockholm School of Economics, Sveavägen 65 113 83How to prepareRead this, the minimal viable common ground.Choose one of the stories of care already accrued to OpenCare, and prepare to tell other participants why you think this is a story of open care. The "care" part is generally fairly obvious, so it comes down to saying what makes these initiatives open. You can find many stories and the conversations around them here and here. More detailed instructions on how to prepare – including a detailed agenda – are here. A background paper by Ezio. This expands on the post referred to in item 1 of this list. It is a short read, highly recommended. Looking forward to this! @Costantino @melancon @LuceChiodelliUB @Lakomaa @Tino_Sanandaji @Massimo @zoescope @Rossana_Torri @Noemi
Community-based initiatives contribute in a lot of different ways to the well-being of a community and the people participating. These contributions can take the form of directly supporting people and communities through giving them access to education, healthy food, social support, nature, informations about political and administrative procedures. Indirectly they also allow the development of a culture of mutual help, sharing and empowerment. This post is a description of what we have learned about care structures in communities during our years as community activists building Prinzessinengarten an urban garden in Berlin.But let’s start from the beginning….Prinzessinnengarten: Making gardens from wastelandAt Moritzplatz, a busy roundabout in the center of bustling Berlin-Kreuzberg, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow, turning a lot that was vacant for 60 years into a flourishing garden. Without specific expertise, with little money and motivated by the idea of a communally used garden in the center of the city, we began in summer 2009 to put down the first roots of a flourishing garden between cement and rubble. By now, a huge diversity of plants is growing here as well as a diversity of social relations. People of different origins and of different ages meet and exchange their knowledge and their experience.The Prinzessinnengarten is a communal project; our vegetable beds are shared without anyone claiming individual ownership. Over the course of four years, supporters from the local community have dirtied their hands in order to. This takes place in a neighborhood that is one of the most densely developed and socially most vulnerable in the city. Here a garden evolved that can sustain itself financially and that grew into a locus of social exchange and mutual learning.Prinzessinnengarten, as well as other urban gardens in Germany, have been able to develop small economies around its activities. Prinzessinnengarten has been able to support 15 full-time jobs during it seasons, being financially independent through its economic activities such as horticulture, the tending of a small café, selling its products, as well as giving training in gardening, ecology or the planning of further gardens. At the same time, it has been able to offer high quality, healthy and ecological food at affordable prices. In cooperation with local institutions, with universities and international partners, the Prinzessinnengarten became a laboratory for resilient forms of urban development. In a pragmatic manner, we have been asking questions on how to deal with urgent issues such as climate change, dwindling resources, food sovereignty and the loss of biodiversity. The answers being experienced and experimented on all strive toward the creation of a resilient city, not only taking global challenges such as climate change into consideration but also incorporating local actors in the building of practical and local solutions.   The success of the garden has been vividly mirrored in vast press coverage: Since 2009, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow „from an ugly vacant lot to a paradise“ (Die Zeit). 60,000 visitors come to Moritzplatz each year to see this „biotope and sociotope with a model character“ (Tagesspiegel), this „utopia in miniature“ (Berliner Zeitung) Despite the garden being a celebrated pioneer project and undisputed value even by official sources, in 2012 the Berlin Property Fund was commissioned to sell the plot of land on which the garden stands. We only had an annually renewable lease, leaving no prospects for long-term planning. Through the immense support of our public and an increasingly motivated government, the Berlin government decided to return the property the Borough of Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain. The Prinzessinnengarten has been able to establish its model character as a locus of social, ecological and urban change.To discuss questions arising from this kind of community engagement, Elizabeth Calderon-Lüning, Marco Clausen, and Asa Sonjasdotter initiated the Neighbourhood Academy in 2015:a self-organized open platform for urban and rural knowledge sharing, cultural practice and activism. This bottom-up academy combines different knowledge- and experienced-based formats: non-standardized knowledge, hands-on know-how, sensuous narratives and research methods. People, organizations, and projects from different neighborhoods come together. Participants can come from Berlin-Kreuzberg or the region around Berlin just as likely as from Detroit or rural areas in Greece to find common ground for learning and teaching. So what have we learned about care structures in communities?In taking over responsibilities in issues that affect the whole society - refugees, climate change, social and ecological justice, to name just a few - community-based and grassroots initiatives play an increasing role in tackling these challenges and their effects on the local level. They are breeding grounds for social innovations and new bottom-up-strategies. Often people take initiative when traditional or institutional forms of care and support decline or do not meet people’s needs. Community gardens and urban agriculture- the field in which I am personally engaged- can serve as a good example. Without being part of planning, or political programs, these places are mostly created by local, self-organized initiatives. Based on local engagement and alternative forms of economy and often without public or financial support, community gardens contribute to the well-being, social inclusion, healthy and sustainable lifestyles, biodiversity, the physical- as well as the social climate. Not only they contribute to the physical health of their participants, but also to their sense of dignity and self-esteem.There is also a downside to community engagement. While community organizations have to promote themselves with success stories to get recognition, political- and financial support, the negative aspects are often less visible. You hear a lot about precarious funding, internal or outside conflicts, political and economic pressure, multitasking, impossible workloads, competition between projects. At the same time, dealing with complex and often rigid political and social institutions, community activists have to become self-trained experts in finances, public relations, lobbying, community-organizing etc. But these fights are long and complex and the institutions and their procedures require a patience that easily outlive the time, the physical and mental resources individuals and grassroots initiatives are able to mobilize.Over time, this situation can result in what you might call an „activism-burnout“. When this happens, physical, mental, and social damages are far too often just seen as a personal or biographical drama. These individual burn-outs are likely to be accompanied by a weakening or even a collapse of the organizations and initiatives that are often carried by the engagement of single individuals. The disintegration can lead to a situation where an organization loses knowledge, expertise, networks, and spirit.For the reasons mentioned above, community care should also include structures to support the people that are directly invested in it. It should create securing and supporting networks. Instead of competing, it should allow people from different initiatives in different fields of engagement to share their knowledge of failure. There should be at once structures of collective learning and consultancy, which at the same time help the individuals to find spaces of trust and recreation. With the Neighborhood Academy, we started informal meetings with members of different groups and initiatives, not only to exchange experience and knowledge and to broaden networks and alliances, but also to deal with stress, conflict, fear, doubt, and failure on a more personal level. Even though this is just a tentative beginning, we experience a need for this kind of care and support structures, which was previously not expressed. Often issues related to the stressful conditions of organizations and community initiatives are externalized into the private and infuse personal relations . Therefore on a structural level, we see these caring structures also as a form to win even when you lose.Community groups often focus on single questions, spaces, conflicts. They often react under economic and time pressure to immediate problems. They act within marginalized or weak political and economical communities. They deal with institutions and stakeholders with more time, much power, and resources whereas they rely on limited personal resources or precarious funding. Simultaneously there are a lot of joy, learning and personal empowerment involved as well as a sense of a meaningful life and community relations. However, the risk of failing is high, which can lead to frustration and disintegration.Community care structures can help to ease this stress not only in giving support but also in a form of what we call „collective learning“. They can work as an archive for the knowledge, the experiences and know-how being created in grassroots and community initiatives. Thus, they allow activists to see themselves not only as part of a singular local fight that you might win or lose but as contributors to a collective living memory. 
In the context of our design challenge, we joined the team of “Über den Tellerrand kochen” in their KitchenHub on May 28th to taste and learn about the many different ways to prepare spinach in different countries as for example in Afghanistan, Iran, Syria or South Tyrol.“Über den Tellerrand kochen” is a Berlin based social business, which by using food aims at “[…] creating a new togetherness among refugees and locals and achieving long-lasting integration in a process that involves people from all corners of society participating on their own initiative.” (https://ueberdentellerrandkochen.de/en/about/). About every month they organise a cooking event called “50 shades of…”. This time it was spinach. They put up different cooking stations where we were welcome to help the cooks. The informal and open-minded atmosphere made conversations of all sorts very easy. Here are some pictures of the event.For us the most important insight we gained is the following:The Afghan women who cooked told us that they live in a refugee camp where they do not have any cooking facility and are therefore more than happy about every chance to cook elsewhere. It relaxes and enables them to act out. Every second week they meet up at the KitchenHub to cook. To feel secured it is important to them to be only a small and female group on those days. Therefore the size of the group is kept small even though there has been an increasing demand. Such places are rare and seem to be deeply needed. We are going to cook with one of them in a park to try out whether outside cooking especially in terms of privacy is an option for them as well or not.We heard another related story at our experimental cooking night. Three friends from Syria joined us that day. Two of them are living in an emergency accommodation. The other one got transferred to another camp. The two former do not have access to any kitchen where they live, the latter can use the shared kitchen. From time to time his two friends even join him for cooking, because they really miss doing it.Not having access to cooking facilities seems to be a big issue. “Food security” including cooking is part of “feeling at home”. How can we enable people to do so?
In the context of our design challenge we undertook a little cooking experiment. We asked ourselves what is the minimum of tools needed for cooking everyday recipes? Thinking about cooking on the street and therefore designing some mobile advice the equipment question seems relevant to us. How can one transport the object from one place to the other? This is amongst other things determined by the needed utensils. When using the term “needed” one has to take the whole cooking experience into consideration. We have to ask which tools are needed for preparing a specific dish, but we also have to ask how one feels being limited to these?SettingTo examine this question we invited people with different cultural backgrounds to a cooking night. They formed a Syrian, an Israeli, an Austrian and a Chinese group. Along with the invitation they all had to chose one everyday dish from their country of origin, which they wanted to prepare. The ingredients and facility were provided. The real task for each group was to choose very limited cooking appliances from three different stations as well as to get along with only one hotplate (either electric plate or camping stove). We uploaded some pictures of the night here.ReflectionOverall I would say that everyone had a good night cooking, eating and mostly laughing together. It was great to share so many different dished by the end of the night and therefore get the opportunity to taste so many different things. The reactions to being limited varied from cheating, getting here and there frustrated to laughing, accepting it and becoming creative.A few interesting observations, which we have to take into account designing:Everyone constantly kept running to the water basin at the other end of the room – for washing vegetables, cleaning the tools for the next steps, washing hands or cleaning the table with a sponge. The Israeli cook also told us, that water is one of the most important things for him while cooking.Things got dirty very quickly. While trying for example to bake Kaiserschmarrn (cut-up and sugared pancake with raisins) on the camping stove, the pan dropped and some of the still liquid dough ran out.People got creative. They used empty cans to lay down a ladle or fished out flour chunks using a sieve.The different textures and coatings of a cooking pot / pan matter more than we thought. Trying to bake Chinese street food crepes, the group had to change the pan three times before it worked. First they tried out a wok in which the dough unevenly backed thoroughly due to its round form, than the pan surface was to big for the electric plate.Some of the hotplates did not get warm enough. They did not have enough power. For some dishes this was fine, but for others as the Syrian fried potatoes a lot of heat was needed.Being asked afterwards the Syrian group explained that being limited in terms of cooking utensils is no real option for them. They managed to prepare their dish but in general there are too many dishes in Syria for which up to 6 cooking pots are needed. It seems to vary from recipe to recipe, but also from food culture to food culture.What else would you like to know about this cooking experiment? Maybe your questions could help us with the analysis.
“Don’t assume a person with a disability is easily offended.”                                                                                     —“Disability Etiquette” from Wikipedia.  At the beginning of the research, we asked ourselves, “What is disability?”According to Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care by Bachrach Miller, the terms regarding disability are defined as such:“Impairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal, such as not being able to make a muscle move…Disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age is able to perform. … Handicap is the term used to describe a child or adult who, because of the disability, is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and socio-cultural milieu…All disabled people are impaired, and all handicapped people are disabled, but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled, and a person can be disabled without being handicapped.”[1]Nowadays, more and more people begin to pay attention to how to address people with disabilities. The use of “people-first language”* in English aims to “avoid the subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities”[2]. However, as the researches continue and after we interviewed a few people with disabilities, we soon realized that language is not really a problem. Every person we interviewed all said that the word “disability” doesn’t bother them at all and they don’t mind being called “disabled” because it is a fact. (Interview with Raul Krauthausen by @Moriel).So here is the question, if the language / term / vocabulary doesn't matter as much as we think, where does the problem really lies?Another example would be: why is it okay to say someone has dark hair but not okay to say someone is a gay or someone is a black especially in the western countries? It is because people who used these terms earlier in the history had a strong prejudice and discrimination in mind. In the end, language was created to describe things as how they are. There is nothing wrong with language itself if people don’t think otherwise to begin with.Could it be that some of us—people without physical disabilities—think that the current terms we use are offensive is because we are subconsciously offending them in the first place? So the question is not how to change the language, or other visible things. The question is how we can change people’s opinion.    * For example: use “a person with a vision impairment” instead of “a blind person”1.http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/gaitlab/cpGuide.html2.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language This is a group project on going #able with @Moriel, @ChristineOehme and @Luise Kröning  
On Sunday the 15th of june i met with Raul Krauthausen. Raul is a activist for disability rights and founder of the nonprofit organisation „Sozialhelden“.Raul has glass bones and sits in a wheelchair. I asked him several questions and a couple of them i will list in this essay:Raul believes that people with disabilities are in a way sorted out of the everyday life. They are in special-needs schools, sheltered workshops, care homes etc. This results in prejudice and fear. „Every tenth person in our society has a disability, but not every tenth person in our circle of friends is disabled. That means: They have to be somewhere! We are hidden. In „specialized institutions“. We are engaged in sheltered workshops, brought into care homes, because we are too expensive if we want to live alone…“In our conversation, he emphasized, that people with disabilities are always associated with a cost-factor. But not only that. There is always a „special“ solution for people with disabilities. He gave me the advice, since I study product design, to always try to include people with disability into my designs. Not to try to find a special solution for people with disabilities but to mainstream it. This would be a big step towards inclusion.We also talked about the „ Behindertengleichstellungsgesetzt“. (Disabled-equality-law)This law aims to eliminate or prevent discrimination against persons with disabilities and ensures equal participation of people with disabilities in the life in society and enables them to independent living.In Germany however, only the state is obliged to guarantee accessibility, e.g. in public offices, buildings, etc.But if we compare how often we go to a state office and how often we go to a café, restaurant, cinema or supermarket, it is very unbalanced. Inclusion and participation can therefore only work, if the private sector must be involved. Furthermore private companies provide jobs, that may be also filled up with people with disabilities. It is unrealistic to believe, that the „disabled-equality-law“ is sufficient enough, if it only takes the state in the duty.So to make a step towards an inclusive society, it must come to encounters between people with and without disabilities. But for creating encounters, we have to remove barriers. So the cause is the barrier and the result is the non existing encounter. For successful inclusion, in which it is no longer necessary to use term „inclusion“, we need accessibility.I also asked Raul what he wishes for the social intercourse between people with and without disabilites. This was his answer:„More normality. More everyday life. Not that someone needs to change his behavior, that happens naturally. I don't want to teach a seminar with the topic how to interact with people with disabilities. Everyone will teach it themselves if we meet each other. This would mean, that we need to remove barriers. We have to open schools and universities for people with disabilities. If we would meet each other, we would learn from each other. I personally only learned how to interact with disability by interacting with disability. Its learning by doing. There is no school for that.“
How do we give and receive care?In this context, there exists the dislikable notion of 'vulnerable groups' that need more help than others and thus are limited in their actions. That is especially the case for physically disabled people.But where does disability start? Is it the medical condition which is declaring people as disabled or is it the surroundings, the social environment? Is is the disability which disables?Our observation: People are being disabled – by other people, objects, environments. As such, people aren't disabled, but they are impaired. Only when their impairments collide with the environment, we can talk of disability. Also, often the language used is misleading and leaves a biased image of disability. This should be a final call to apply universal design, as design should be as barrier-free as possible and disability is to be understood multidimensional.To face our design challenge, we agreed to do research about an superordinate topic: How can we change society's persepective about disability?While gathering information, we came up with further questions:How can we make environments inclusive from the beginning so that it's not 'us' versus 'them' anymore? How can we focus on what they can do instead on what they can't do? How can we change the exclusive language? Do we only have disabled people because we lable them this way?And finally, how can we design something which is inclusive by design and not by label? This design question as our current state of research still has to be refined.In order to focus our design question, we tried to narrow down our target group, which is kind of tricky as we want to reach out to the disabled people as well as 'society' as a whole. So we will try to integrate both in our future findings and design iterations.Something which was very clear to us was the following: Shockingly, we know almost nothing about disabilities! So what do we know?We only make assumptions about disabled people facing limitations, not being able to live freely, not being able to have a fulfilled life or to carry out all activities a non disabled person would do. We assume they always need a person they can depend on and face social isolation as well as isolation through physcial objects, meaning barriers. Paradoxically, we don't know what they CAN do. We seem to only know what they can't do. And we know that there is this exclusive setting for the disabled, prejudice and fear of contact.We searched for leads and areas where disability appears. We found many organizations and projects, like community projects, workshops, events. So the group members did field research by observation, recording, filming, taking interviews and hands-on activities – with famous motivational speakers and fascinating personalities like Raul Krauthausen, by visiting workshops and by experiencing blindness in a museum.Disabled people need barrier-free environments, acceptance, suitable language and connection. They don't need pity, special treatment, including being labled.As there are several types of disabilities, it seems impossible to to address all of them in our design challenge: hearing or visual impairment, psychological, cognitive or motoric impairment – all of them need a different approach in the design process. Thus, in the iteration process, we are about to develop designs that are as inclusive as possible and that ensure the fundamental right of social participation to people with all kinds of impairments.Our mission is to change the negative perception of disability and develop products or services so that people aren't defined by their disablity. We found that disabiltiy is more a social phenomenon: there is no autonomous person, being dependent on someone is the most natural thing and everyone has their own restrictions. Childhood plays a crucial part in humans behaviour towards people who seem different as this stage is important for everyone's personal development. Kids don't have any fears of contact. We want to make visible that there are benefits for both sides, the care giver and care taker, and we want to enable people to connect with each other through design.
One more time,  I am writing this story on behalf of a WeMake codesign session attendee, in order to preseve their privacy.The older we grow the more limited our motion become, and the less capable we are of taking care of ourselves. At a certain age, an elderly would need near to 24/7 attention in order to ensure that they are doing fine.  Mainly, they didn't just slip and fall down, while harming themselves or going into coma.  As a care giver, it is very frustrating and very stressful not to e able to keep an eye on the people you care for, and because it might be literally impossible to keep company of the ones you care for all the time (even at the caretaking place), life will be easier if a certain device is attached to the ones we care for, and is able to alarm us if they fell down.   Then we can adjust functionalities of what reactions does this device do after the fall alaram.  Call a certain number? Call the police? Wait for the person to cancel the alarm and announce that they are fine.    A badly designed or less functional device will make it difficult for elderly ones to put it on and use.  Imagine if someone had a push button necklace that they can press to call the ambulance in case of danger, but because the mecklace looked silly, the person never put it on, and eventually they did die at a certain accident where they could have been saved by the neckalce.  Imagine, how the care giver feels?   Could you?We need a solution that is funtional and inviting where elderly people can put it on, use it, and keep themseleves safe, while lift off some of the concern of the ones who need to take care of them.?  Imagine?Header image by Jérémy-Günther-Heinz Jähnick This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license 
The below story is written by a third party (Me!), on behalf of a participant at the WeMake codesign session.In any city you can find parking lots reserved for drivers with disaplibity.  In all cities!  However, the law is different, while some countries allow you to temporarily use the lot while your engine is still on, others don't even let you drive inside, and in both cases, other drivers, who are not disabled, give themselves the liberty to use the available parking lot dedicated for disabled, because the found it empty.   If you have a disabiliy and you end up never finding the places that are dedicated to you whenever you are trying to park.  Wouldn't it be much more fair for everyone, to create a system, that react to others who carelessly took your parking?   If you are lucky enough, maye the system can alarm the police to come and take action, if not, at least, the system can alarm others that someone without a disability is now stealing a disabled person's place.  Possibly, the social aspect is just as important as the legal fine.    What do you think?Header image by Tgv8925, this file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license.    
Greetings everyone, the below challenge is based on the work done during the co-design session at WeMake.  We would like to share it as a challenge, to get feedback, give more visibility, and make it easy to collaborate on this idea, if someone is interested.The story is written by a third party (me!), while keeping privacy of the original problem poster safe :)If you are paralyzed, you are most likely using a wheelchair, and if you use a wheelchair, then you need someone to push the wheelchair in order to help you navigate through the city.   Not only does this make the challenged person feel like a burden, but it adds another layer of inconvenience, which is privacy.    Due to the nature of how most wheelchairs are designed, the person who aids the person who needs care, has to accompany this person everywhere, limiting the chances of being able to navigate the city or any place independently while enjoying privacy and a little independence.  The challenge gets worse in places like train stations, airports, metro stations, basically any place with stairs, an over crowded, and the requirement of different modes of motion.  Would it be possible to think of a mechanical system that can be attached to all “standard” wheelchairs,  that can revolutionize their functionality of the wheelchair, making it possible to access every place and surface easily with it, while keeping the expenses to do so, within limits?   Any thoughts?*Header image author Tim99~commonswiki, This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.
The title picture shows the "PopUpGrill" (http://journal.aetherapparel.com/2014/04/03/pop-up-grill/). A great project by Jonas Rylander which we find very inspiring for our design challenge you can read about in the following post.What are the expectations about the use of public spaces when it comes to cooking on the street?Even tough I already put up a short résumé of our research phase here, now follows the detailed version to allow an even better understanding for everyone interested. Also we would like to share the other surprising insights we have gained so far. Maybe they are helpful to one or the other and maybe some of you would like to contribute. What are your thoughts on and what is your interpretation of all this? We would be very thankful for any comments!To first introduce us: We are a group of 4 university students from Berlin, three product designers and one socio economic communication designer and call ourselves “A Taste of Home”. How we came up with the name and the following design question, I will tell below:“How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?”Two month ago we went into the field asking ourselves “How can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home and include other people living in this “foreign” country?” Amongst others we ended up talking to one 24 year-old guy from Syria and one girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.Both of them are living in a caring environment. One in a shared flat with wonderful people (“locals”) who are all very closed to each other and the other together with her boyfriend who originally is from Germany. After having found out about this we dropped the second half of our starting question “[…] and include other people living in this “foreign” country?” , because we did not see this need anymore. They are already sharing their everyday life with “locals”, therefore also cooking with them. At least in this context one could say, they are well integrated. This left us with “How can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?”In terms of food culture we found out that it is mostly about eating as an occasion. It’s about the taste, but even more about the surrounding atmosphere. The Syrian guy once got invited to the home of a Syrian family also living in Berlin for dinner. The food was “yummy” and “It tasted, just like it does when my mom cooks.”, but what he enjoyed even more were the conversations, the way things were handled around the table. The two little boys of the family were fighting over the remote control just like he and his siblings used to do back home. There was a lot of fooling around which not just he but everyone enjoyed.Both the Syrian guy and the Korean girl are still cooking dishes they know from back home, even though it never tastes as good as it does when their moms cook. They both said that they left home to early to develop great cooking skills and learn all the tricks. In Korea traditionally a woman would only start cooking by herself after her marriage. Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents’ homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active. Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home. Some just take too much time in preparation: “Maybe 4 to 5 hours.”, the Syrian guy told us. Having to divide their time between work, German classes, socialising and cooking most of the days they are not willing to spent these many hours on the latter.Before going on and explaining how we reshaped our design question with this knowledge in mind, I would like to share one more surprising insight we gained through the two interviews.Talking about food and well being the Syrian guy told us that when he had just arrived to Germany, he did not like to eat outside. It disgusted him. Not being able to see the food preparation made him feel uncomfortable. We tried to find out the reason for this, whether it was because he eats Halal, which he does or it was out of cleanliness concerns, but yet could not manage to do so. We still have to ask again. What happened here shows one of the difficulties we had conducting the interviews. The question triggered some awkwardness. This we felt, but why we were not able to tell. Was it because the subject was sensitive to the respondent and his eating customs? Was it because he did want to offend us since we were talking about German food? How can we overcome such awkwardness whenever it occurs in future interviews?To go on with the process of our research I would first like to recall the reshaped design question: “How can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?” It still seemed like the question was to broad to be solved in one design project. This is why we changed the target group “people on the move” to “young migrants” (20-30 years of age). We felt that the latter was more suitable for coming up with a specific design and the people we had interviewed both fit in this category. We then went back to synthesising the interviews once more and found that they were totally worth a second look. There was this whole topic of interactive food customs and traditions we yet had not paid enough attention to.Reviewing our notes we got to understand, that for the people we had talked to “feeling at home” in the context of food culture was a lot about the interactive customs and traditions which they had been surrounded by most of their lives. The Syrian guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. He told us, that this maybe does not happen in bigger towns but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.The girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends. They wanted to have some good Korean food, chat and meet new people. It turned out to be a disappointment. It was too expensive – there was even an entrance fee – and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events. Considering these stories it made sense to rephrase or specify our question to: “How can we enable young migrants to integrate interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their cultures of origin into Berlin’s community life?” Furthermore it was then that we came up with our group name “A Taste of Home”.It finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now. She told us about an interview her group conducted with three Syrian refugees. During their conversation the interviewees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they always would have had back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. Having been asked if they are organising similar activities here in summertime, they denied. They thought that in Berlin it was forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and did not want to act against the law seen their uncertain statuses. Still they miss them. It was this story which made us change the question to: “How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?”This question has to be considered on different levels. The higher-level question is: “How to harmonize the expectations about how to use public spaces?” What do “newcomers”, what do “locals”, what does everyone using those places want and how can the once being mutually exclusive to each other being handled? The second level is the topic of cooking on the street. Where, how and in which contexts is cooking in public spaces wanted? And last but not least the design challenge is about getting to know the legal frame and making it graspable for everyone.All this is related to the fact, that there are a lot of refugees staying in camps where they do not have any opportunity to cook at all or even if they receive “food money” instead of catering, they only have access to a shared kitchen. Another guy from Syria we cooked with lives in such a place. He told us, that the huge number of people who are sharing the kitchen there is often keeping him away from cooking. Though some of his friends who are living in another camp without cooking facilities sometimes join him for cooking. How can we enable them to make cooking a regular part of their lives again?
We are already starting to work on the next edition of our annual gathering of the Edgeryders community.

The World Wide Web is increasingly useful to experiment, produce and research for identities, relations and objects in the field of "Healthcare & Innovation" such as Open Source, Open Access, 3D printing and Additive manufacturing, HCWH (Health Care Without Harm), Augmented and Virtual Reality, Co-Working, Workscaping and other important and emerging issues. The bet of PUNTOZERO is to call for interest and shape a networking model motivating healthcare professionals in sharing experiences and co-driving innovation and care programs together with patients and open networks.Read our agenda.The idea at the core of PUNTOZERO is that there are still often missing masses -mainly issues and narratives stood and promoted by citizens and patients- in healthcare sets and education curricula. Such issues turn to be interesting especially when dealing about and advocating for innovation, open source and access, DIY, networking, collaboration, communities of practice, etc... Healthcare professions students handle and study subjects and programs about "healthcare", but often are not trained and motivated in practice to collaboration and innovation, for a better understanding of the society and such fast-changing world. The web represents a formidable "umwelt" for those who like to experiment, network and collaborate even in the field of health information, prevention and biomedical research. It is time to promote open care practices in medical schools, nurse schools and hospitals as well.  The project includes a accessible site via the github pages and the social networks' groups and profiles; at the same time it supports activities, communication and resources for about 150 students of 5 healthcare professions Masters on 5 e-Learning communities of the University of Parma, in Italy. The MOODLE environment used by students and tutors is shared open source and downloadable from here.Free to comment, join and collaborate with us![] Community [] Contact[] e-Learning[] Research [] Social[] Tutorials
The situation for Armenia’s visually impaired has, in many ways, worsened, since the collapse of the USSR. Despite attempts at isolating people with disabilities, Soviet principles of equality inspired policies aiming to turn them into productive members societies as much as possible. They could thus benefit from some level of state assistance. This situation changed, as lack of funding, and general stigma against human imperfection, (ironically also inherited from the Soviets) have made it increasingly difficult for people with disabilities to reach their full potential. General apathy coupled with a lack of political will to tackle some of the issues related to people with disabilities, particularly, the visually impaired. This has lead to the rise of civil society organisations aiming to address these problems head-on on their own. Aside from some NGOs which have been fighting for the rights of the disabled, private sector solutions have also begun to take shape. Among those is the Seeing Hands massage studio. Seeing Hands came about as the result of my previous work with an NGO for the visually impaired, where I learned about all the challenges, socio-economic problems, and stigma that the beneficiaries faced. Through my work with an NGO for the visually impaired, I found that there are 6,000 blind people in Armenia, and only about 20-25 of them were permanently employed. Upon doing some research, i discovered a Soviet-era plan to train the visually impaired as therapeutic masseurs and built upon that Idea. Enlisting the help of my friend Liana Avetian, a trained and certified clinical masseuse, we began to train some willing pioneers. The basic concept was a massage studio that capitalises on the heightened tactile sense afforded by visually impaired citizens while creating respectable jobs by training and employing them as masseurs. We also received initial support from UNDP Armenia’s Kolba Labs to open our Massage Studio “Seeing Hands”, in a new location. Though challenging at first, Avetian found that students were fast learners; to compensate for the loss of sight, their other senses were enhanced. “The receptors in their fingers are very much developed, their hands are like their eyes, It’s perfect for them, but the biggest problem is that sometimes they’re not trusting you easily - because if you don’t see, you will not trust." 'The organisation is, on one hand, a studio that provides high-quality massages for patrons, and on the other (seeing) hand, it's an opportunity for a too-often marginalised demographic to get access to jobs, training, and empowerment. Seeing Hands also took advantage of Armenia’s recent tech boom, which now employs thousands of IT professionals. This creates a new demographic of well paid middle-class people who spend their days hunched in front of a computer and often developing back pain. This allows us to train more masseurs to meet such a demand. We currently have 4 full time masseurs: 3 men and one woman, and 2 more being trained.   This concept has also gotten attention outside of Armenia, and we are already in talks to franchise the model across the region, such as in neighbouring Georgia. We are also considering other private ventures, of Private-Public Partnerships to explore other ways in which people with disabilities can be active, and productive members of society.   I want to note that a disability could happen to anyone, as is the case with some of my workers, and that it could change a person’s entire life. But that didn’t  close all of their doorsSuch social businesses are a positive example to break stereotypes about people with disabilities [and their presumed] inability to work

Language Barrier – How can we build a Bridge?Non-Germans want to learn German and want to take part in social life.Germans are not as enthusiastic yet. They don`t want to feel obligated.How can we still create social interaction?That´s what we already tried out;) SPRACHPICKNICKIDEA AFTER RESEARCH:Giving German people a SIGN which could be a print on a shirt, sticker, bag, what ever that says: “Hey, join us!”/”Don´t be shy!”/”Take part!”…They´ll have the opportunity to put it on in a situation where they want foreign people to participate – Non-Germans wouldn´t have a as hard time to bring oneselfes to do the first step.Background and research People say the are willing to help, but they don´t want to feel obligated!There are two parties: the NEWBIES on the one hand and the Germans, or LOCALS on the other hand.Both of them are having different needs because they are in different situations.We were doing surveys with both groups.-NEWBIES:-NEWBIES are looking so badly for LOCALS who would like to spend just a little time with them!-NEWBIES are afraid of doing the first step towards LOCALS.-NEWBIES are afraid of being rejected.-LOCALS:-LOCALS are willing to help.-But they say they don´t have that much time and don’t want to have more appointments.-LOCALS don’t want to be responsible.-They want to stay spontaneous.How can we balance those two perspectives?The CampaignSAY HEY is a line of branded sports equipment, weather resistant stickers, bags and posters designed to facilitate social interaction between people who are attempting to learn a new language and customs, and local residents who like to engage in cultural exchange... or just make new friends :)SAY HEY is a tag that shows how open you are for new people to join. It will bring Berliners and newbies together. Support our crowdfunding campaign: https://www.startnext.com/sayhey
Recently the worst fears of Romanian medical state infrastructure came true. Hexi Pharma, a major company selling disinfectants to hospitals all over the country was discovered to have diluted their products even 10 times from the labelled concentration, to the point of causing infections of thousands of patients in the system over the last years (news here).This is just scratching the surface and confirms deep system fail: (1) underfunding and horrendous infrastructure making large numbers of young doctors leave - to give you an idea, more Romanian doctors are working in other EU countries (>20K) than in Romania (10-13K) (2) the perverse circle of paying under the counter - there is no way out: if you’re not paying as a patient, you risk not being watched over; if you’re a doctor and refuse the “gift”, you show weakness and worry patients; you’re also a threat for colleagues because you’re messing up with their system.  This post is not a rant about the system, it's to share 3 stories and how they connect with it as much as we like to escape it. Special thanks to @Moushira for contributing questions along the way 
How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?This is the design challenge we want to solve during the on-going term or lets just say face at the moment. It came up to us through some interviews we and friends conducted in the last weeks with refugees or other newcomers in Berlin. What are your thoughts on this?To make it easier for everyone interested to follow I will try to sum up the thoughts we had and the experiences we made recently.Starting with the question “How can food help people on the move to feel at home wherever they are at the moment?” amongst others we got to talk to a 24 year old guy from Syria and a girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.Some of the most remarkable insights we got are about food some are not. Two I want to share because they add to our design question.The guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. Maybe this does not happen in big towns he says but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.The girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends, to chat, meet new people and have some good Korean food but it ended up being too expensive, there was even an entrance fee and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events.After those interviews we talked about the “Berlin Thaipark”, were mostly Thai women sell homemade southeast Asian dishes on their blankets more or less being tolerated by the bureaucracy; about a great project by the New York based designer Candy Chang called Street vendor guide where she visualizes the most commonly violated rules in this context for the vendors themselves; and asked ourselves: How can we enable migrants to integrate the interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their culture of origin into Berlins community life?Later on one of our fellow students told us the following:A group of Syrian refugees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they would always have in summertime back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. When being asked if they are doing similar activities here in summertime they deny. They think that it is forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and do not want to act against the law seen their uncertain status. Still they miss them.That basically is how we ended up facing the design question already mentioned above: How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?So far we, a group of 4 university students, call our little project A Taste of Home and would be more than happy about any comments.
From http://rubyetc.tumblr.com/tagged/mh (ht Pauline) First thing that happens during our first ever community meeting online is that the technology doesn’t work. What follows is a hilarious 1.5 hr conversation conducted via a combination of voice, sign language, lip reading and chat.We were joined by @Pauline and @Omri Kaufmann from UDK Berlin, @Costantino  and @ChiaraFrr in Milano, @Nadia and a new community member - Christina whose mission with The Meraki People is to restore and preserve the cultural heritage of mount Parnonas in Greece by turning it into a green production and cultural oasis.In our intros we discovered most of us approach mental wellbeing in terms of how to make support more accessible - by inventoring and designing solutions, by opening up a conversation. I saw two big strands in the conversation that can inform our search:A. Is it safer for an online conversation to only deal with the soft side of mental health? That is, exclude suicide and death? Noemi mentioned how deep suicide is in Ireland both among males and females, as well as it is underreported - it’s not even ranking top in Europe (like former Soviet countries). Pauline added that in Sweden, suicide is the most common cause of death in people between 18-35. Costantino said this was dangerous to approach in OpenCare, even though we know it’s increasingly being flagged in the tech activist sector (see re:Publica session Hacking with Care).Team JUS was on board! They’re working on design that explores vulnerability: We want to research objects that people are handling or certain gestures they are doing while in therapy. Can we find a certain patterns in these behaviours or interactions? Maybe we can do something with it? We found in the interviews/chats we started with our peers as well that it was very difficult for them to open up. We also had some observations how to create a sharing environmentTheir design will most probably involveHuman connection - "if you just throw your thoughts in the air without any feedback it is less interesting than if you are sharing with people with whom you have an intimate relationship" (Nadia). Some external tokens to facilitate this, like objects (bridging connection between repetitive gestures and calming yourself down); maybe space (pop-up confession booths). B. Or should we really push ourselves over the edge and experiment? Is there relief in black humor?This can be simply by asking people on the streets How are you? and then "Really, how are you?". More advanced versions include drawing inspiration from funeral traditions involving celebrations of sorts thru drinks, food, but also social grieving (Eastern Europe, Jewish culture, Italy, Germany were mentioned).  .. for the rest I will have to let the notes speak as I won’t do them justice)N: How would you design for maximum inappropriateness. What are the most inappropriate jokes you can make in a situation where someone is in pain? How do you piss people off at a Jewish funeral? How to make the grieving person forget about their sorrow and want to kill you instead?N: Because there is some relief in black humour.P: i love it. dealing with depression through humor and showing your feelingsO: How do we choose who to talk to?P:'survivors'?O: I would talk to someone who had a similar experience and can connect with me and understand me.N: Anonymous emotionalists. "let the crazy out in small pieces- not all at once". XYKD did a fantastic comic on depression https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/14txdv/xkcd_honest/O: 1 I would also talk to someone i know very little or not at allNe: +1"What made you understand that you were depressed"?N: My partner said I should probably take a shower.P: but that's important too! finding the right kind of treatment; therapy varies alot depending on the person too, the treatment guyN: Inability to take any decisions. Decision to not go to shrink. Just getting stuck.P: the scale of our project is probably much smaller than the whole conversation you are interested in having on Edgeryders right?P: dark horse is there alsoC: this track to do with emotions and mind etc can be a long term track within opencare;Imperfect, super unreliable tools and unsuitable places to kill yourself.Placebo pillsHomeopathic poison pillPlease join our growing group and help build a sensible brief around emotional wellbeing here.
The last two weeks we made some research at the Refugee Camp at ICC Messe Berlin. The very nice volunteer Berivan showed us around and we had the chance to talk directly with the people.The first time we visited I was surprised how „good“ the atmosphere was. I somehow always thought a refugee camp would be a very sad place, but children were running around playing and everyone was kind of open and nice to each other (from my point of view). The ICC Messe is a former congress centrum which was recently rebuilt to be a refugee camp. The Big Main Hall is segmented with thin white walls into something like 40 rooms that look like roofless boxes. Instead of doors there are blankets and towels covering the entrances. There are no windows; in this main Hall the light comes from tubes in the ceiling. Inside of each room there are 4 bunk beds, so in total 8 people per room (familys are usually separated and live in private rooms, also: the rooms are separated by gender).Usually the rooms don't have any kind of furniture inside, but the one we were sitting in had a big picnic table and a bench and also a bunch of office chairs. We got offered very sweet black Tea in plastic cups and started sharing stories. Firstly we asked how people organize themselves in the room.The Camp is designed for people to stay around three months, but most of the people are staying six or more. There are only the bare necessities provided. For example there are no possibilities to unpack the backpacks or suitcases, which are probably unpacked since the beginning of the journey. Thats why the people find solutions, for example they pull out nails from the wall and hang their cloth on these nails. Or they found a piece of metal string which they also used to hang cloth from. There are also some card boxes used as bed table and chest. Hussam (who is diligently learning German) pointed at one of the card boxes saying „Kühlschrank“. We were laughing but it was true! tomatoes, cans of beans and a lot of eggs were stored there. Also under the bed was a lot of food (maybe the darkest and coldest spot in the room). The reason for that is that they don't always like food by the caterer and of course you get hungry between the official „meals“. They boil the eggs in a water cooker by the way! Another interesting observation was a little plastic cup full of washing powder.(they usually give the dirty cloth away to the washing and get them back clean) Hussam told us that he likes his shirts to be without creases and because there is no way to iron,he washes them with his hands and drys them in the room. That was eye opening for me because, yes they might have nothing but they have dignity and preferences! they start a living.Also very interesting is that in the bunk beds the bottom bed is the preferred bed because they can build a little privacy by hanging towels and sheets at the upper bed. The upper bed is always dependent on the main light system which is switched off at 11 in the night.Berivan told us that in one room they build constructions out of a broken bunk bed so that also the upper bed could shield from the light.Another very striking construction was a piece of wood sticked to the wall with duct tape which was supposed to be a smartphone shelf, to watch movies at night.Also they put pictures from magazines on the wall to make the atmosphere a little more cosy.But still even if they find the possibility to hack something there is a lot of stuff just flying around in the room.There was a lot of creativity to make the most out of the given, bit still no tools or materials. Berivan told us they used to give out tools, but because they never came back so there are no tools anymore. What if we could support the already existing creativity by opening a space for tools and materials? encouraging them with their ideas and hacks?
Sometimes I feel like my friends can’t quite take me seriously when I tell them how much art school is stressing me. When I hear myself describe to them what we do in our courses (like dressing up and dancing around cardboard sculptures of alien Christmas trees), I sometimes find it difficult to take myself seriously. However, as most people that work in a creative field would probably tell you, it really is stressful. Being creative is intense. Apart from the financial uncertainty and competitiveness that tend to run in these professions, the work itself is very demanding, mentally and emotionally. It is very easy to become personally invested in a project, some might even call this is a necessity. Because they are so closely intertwined, it is often difficult to separate between the professional and the personal. How does this affect the way we deal with issues of mental and emotional wellbeing in this context?In Product Design, we are constantly brought to question our surroundings, our decisions, and most importantly, ourselves. There has been a crisis point in almost any project where this turned into seriously doubting myself and hating all the work I had done. Sometimes, it led to absolute public meltdowns. To me it is a strange and uncomfortable feeling to share such intimate moments with people I work with.Many of my friends that study creative subjects have told me about similar experiences in their lives, particularly about struggles with insecurity and stress of varying degrees. Are these emotional strains simply an occupational hazard that we as creatives have to accept? Are they something we should embrace, something we actually need to produce meaningful work? There seems to be a romanticized idea of the tragically ailed, mad genius, based on the stories of countless artists like van Gogh or Beethoven that produced some of their best work during periods of Depression or Hypomania. Joshua Walters proposes in his Ted Talk ‘On being just crazy enough’, that those suffering from mental conditions might just be more sensitive to the world than others and that we can use our ‘skillness’ to our advantage. Many scientific studies suggest in fact, that there is a link between creativity and mental illness. One theory is that those with strong creative inclination perceive the world with a heightened awareness and tend to be more reflective and ruminate in their thoughts.For me, a host of questions and problematics arise out of this. How do these factors influence people in creative fields in reaching out when in distress? At what point does these different pressures stop aiding creativity and start impeding it? What are your thoughts?
This is mostly for @melancon, but in the spirit of working out loud...OpenCare will produce some software to look at online conversations. The first step is to build a simple (non-semantic) social network representation of the OpenCare conversation, which is a subset of the Edgeryders one. The problem: the OpenCare conversation is spread across three places.The OpenCare Research Group, originally simply called OpenCareThe Op3nCare Community Group, created on 2016-02-19 as it became clear that the original group was mixing administrative stuff and content stuff.The new Challenge Response type nodes (here). The solution: Go through the Research group and assign non-admin content to the Op3n Care community group. Convert into Challenge responses the posts that look more like open care stories.Keep all of the content in the Community group.Keep all the content in the Challenge Responses.This is now done. Guy and I have created views to export the content database thus selected in JSON format. Accessing the views requires admin powers.users: https://edgeryders.eu/en/admin/structure/views/view/clone_of_users_for_edgesense/editcontent: https://edgeryders.eu/en/admin/structure/views/view/guy_content/editcomments: https://edgeryders.eu/en/admin/structure/views/view/guy_comments/editResults are encouraging. At the time of writing, we have:54 different users involved in the conversation (includes the OpenCare team!)156 between challenge responses, posts, wikis, events.1,104 comments
When I visited Berlin-based artist and hacker Bengt Sjölen’s studio earlier this week he was developing the hardware for of OpenDrop: an open source digital platform for controlling small droplets of liquids using electro-wetting technology. It struck me that we ought to be looking at open wetware and synthetic biohacking in Op3ncare. Because there is a lot of scope for DIY and citizen science to actually make advances in developing new care solutions. There are many areas where this could help us to solve pressing problems like antibiotics resistance.Bengt mentioned an experimental initiative to use some of the properties of silk produced from recombinant bacteria to break quorum sensing. This means you break cell-cell communication within and across bacterial species. It matters because this is a contributing factor to a number of clinically relevant things like making harmless bacteria produce enzymes which attack host tissues, produce toxins, stick to hosts and protect themselves while outside hosts. It may also be a way to break their antibiotic resistence….The reasoning is that antibiotics typically kill or prevent proliferation of bacteria by targeting biomolecules involved in such essential processes as cell wall synthesis, DNA proliferation, or protein synthesis. Treating large populations of bacteria with such agents inevitably selects for a few resistant mutant cells. These proliferate, mutate further, and give rise to antibiotic resistant populations. So you want to get at the entire propulation and since the ability to communicate with one another affects behavior of the entire community....What makes these kinds of intiatives especially interesting is that they are being done in hackerspaces and garages using equipment that anyone can put together from recycled materials.There are already examples where unleashing scientific experimentation amongst the citizenry at large has exceeded expectations.The Malaria Box was an experimental initiative in which 400 diverse compounds with antimalarial activity were distributed in a bid to catalyse drug discovery and research for neglected diseases such as malaria. At a recent medical conference I heard that this initative resulted in several breakthroughs and a number of patents shortly after it was launched.I've only begun to scratch at the surface and have come across the Registry of Standard Biological Parts - a growing collection of genetic parts use for building biological devices and systems and IGEM (“where future life scientists go to get their freak on”). You can see the mind boggling list of what participants have come up with here (click on "team abstracts" from previous iGem competitions here).What could be achieved if many more people were engaging in this kind of open experimentation? How can existing care initiatives better achieve their goals in collaboration with their peers doing exciting work in open science and technologies?Join us for OPENandChange for this kind of projects development sprint to explore how open science and technologies can improve your community care-related project! We're mounting a collective funding application and you’ll get to work with brilliant scientists and your peers from different fields, while moving your project forward. We're also going on a tour in several cities in Europe this September and you can drop by!It’s first come first served, so don’t wait or risk missing out! Image credit: unknown, sourced from the Human Futures website
I started this project with the question „how can i help by giving someone the opportunity to help themselves?“ Everyone wants to be independent in a way. We want to be understood as a person of freedom and to be able to act out of this freedom. The freedom to make one's own choices, and independence of persons is a human right.I thought of a scenario, if someone has specific or non-specific difficulties with something or in certain situations, I would design a tool, which can then be used from an individual or a group alone. The goal at first was to provide a product, service, etc., that is actually really needed. Whatever „it“ is going to be, it is designed for a need, which I have to find out.It should not result in a situation of one helper and one taker. My thought was to help someone in a functional way, and not take their voice away. I want to contribute, so that people can fulfill theirselves, in the way they want to.So I started to think/ look for someone who would have difficulties with something or maybe even a difficulty that the person itself is not aware of.I thought of children, who still develop their motor skills/ movement skills, elderly people in which the body in various factors weakens and people with a disability.I dug deeper into the term disability. What is disability?I asked and still ask myself, where does disability start? Is it the disability itself, that disables people? Or is it the attitude and perception of the society and a non-barrier-free environment which actually disables?A lot of people and especially the media are using phrases as „tied to the wheelchair“, „suffers from …“ „despite the disability“. Thus, a more negative image of disabilities and diseases is shaped. Why don't we use phrases as „lives in a wheelchair“ or „has a disease“ ? This way one does not classify anything. How can a outside observer judge, if a person suffers from a disease and not lives with a disease? Why do we only see the things, that someone can not do? Why do we only see the deficit? Why do we reduce people with a disability to their deficits?Does my original challenge lead me into a new one; how can we change the society’s perspective on differences?The public image of people with a disability restricts rather on sufferers, victims or heroes. Other aspects of life take a back seat. At the end of the day, there is not and never will be one human being on this earth, who can do anything. Aren’t we all disabled in a way? Having a disability can change someones values and goals. Therefore it can not only mean  fate, but a win too.Why do we think that living a happy, fulfilled and satisfied life is easier without disabilities? Why do we think the nonplus ultra is a complete and functioning body? And if so, why being content with e.g. two functioning arms, but only writing with one? Why do we only use our feet for standing or walking? Why not writing, eating or doing other things with our feet instead?We limit ourselves without noticing, and at the same time assume that others are limited.
OpenCare is a project run in collaboration with cities, maker spaces, research institutes, academia, communities on the ground in Europe, and most of all individuals with deep, genuine experiences, which means each and every one of us. Starting now and throughout the next year we are building a community with genuine interest in care and availability to share and get closer to peers around the world.This Monday we are hosting a themed online community call around new approaches to mental, spiritual, emotional health. Several edgeryders have brought this topic in the centre of attention, even without the OpenCare team promoting it:Care in the community (a must read, folks)On being a self-entrepreneurSharing is scaryDesign for vulnerabilityWe are onto something, but to figure things out we need even deeper conversations. On Monday we go though the questions we are asking ourselves about selfcare, depression, medication, peer support, alternatives to living a stressful life and so on. We will try to put it all together to make a bigger picture and launch a proper Challenge.Everyone is welcome to join this call, simply enter this live video and chat room:  https://meet.jit.si/opencare. If you have time ahead of the call, let me know in a comment below if you think emotional distress is something worth approaching like this. We might be far off!

I was lonely for most of my life, I don't have anything too complicated with my family and I had a few friends while growing up but I'd never let anyone in. I had never exposed myself or talked about my feelings. As time went by I got better and better at it. A very good listener my friends called me. Even today I still find myself shifting the subject of the conversation whenever it gets to me.I tried to act like I was Ok, or maybe I was just not aware. I had an eating disorder and a sleeping disorder and it got pretty bad at some points. Almost every night I'd stay in bed awake waiting for my family members to go to sleep, then I'd storm the fridge eating like 4 hungry people, go back to bed feel horrible and couldn't fall asleep.I lived like that for many years, sometimes it was better sometimes worst. I can't tell what drove into seeking help but around the age of 22 I told my mother I think I need help. She was very happy that it came from me rather than her as she was thinking the same.I started going to therapy. It took me nearly 4 months to gain the trust I needed to open my heart but with time my therapist and I became closer and through our conversations I slowly began to understand what my life was missing: love, family and friends. Yeah I've had my loving family, a few friends and a number of short romances but none of it real because I didn't allow it to be, I've never been me.4 years later I'm studying industrial design and doing Erasmus in UdK Berlin.As part of our human centered design course "Hacking Utopia", my partner Pauline and I are focusing on the challenge how we might boost each other's mental and spiritual resilience. After posting here story to Edgeryders, our team member Nele was recommended in a comment to watch Brene Browns Ted talk, The Power of Vulnerability. We have found it so inspiring, it was exactly what we were talking about.At the moment we are trying not to have any idea of how our product will look like so that we can have a neutral research and hopefully a surprising result, but we are looking in the direction of a design intervention that will encourage people to be vulnerable and share their feelings with their loved ones.Both Pauline and I went through therapy and we both agree that what was missing in our lives was the ability to share our difficulties with our close ones. We discovered that both of us had to use objects in order to speak to our therapists. I had to put a cushion over my knees and Pauline was always keeping her hands busy by playing with hair bands or ripping pieces of paper, avoiding eye contact.We were wondering whether you might have made any similar interesting experiences/observations to share with. Do you feel comfortable sharing your feeling with others? Can you get people to open up to you?We are trying to gain insight on what kinds of stressors people find difficult to talk about and how we might make it easier for people to overcome shame and share their feelings, drawing inspiration from any culture, any time.Also, if you have any other Ideas, thoughts, articles, projects, products or whatever you think can inspire us further please let us know.Thank you so much for reading so far,Team JUS.P.s. - We really liked this short video and wish we could make a sofa that feels as good as the hug in the picture above.

Long before I was finally diagnosed with depression 1 year ago, I struggled with intense feelings of stress and self-loathing, feelings that were overwhelming me, because I could not really understand what and why I was experiencing. I consider myself privileged to be born into a comfortable middle class life, to have a supportive family and friends, no academic problems. In theory, I was supposed to be happy. So why was I feeling so paralysed and helpless? Considering there are so many people who have it much worse than me, feeling sad seemed irrational, unjustified and shameful.Everyone around me seemed to manage just fine, effortlessly juggling scholastic and social expectations. So I thought it must be my fault that I was barely holding it together. I was ashamed to admit that I was struggling and ask for help. When I finally gathered enough courage to talk openly about my problems with my friends and family members, I was stunned how much it resonated. Once I had shared my troubles, many of them would admit some of their own. These were people that I had known for more than 10 years, people that I thought I knew inside out, suddenly telling me about insecurities of theirs that I never even suspected them to have. Such moments of connection were a very special experience.However, at times it was also exhilarating. It's not easy for either party. Opening up, even to the people I trust most, took a great deal of mental effort. Then, I didn’t know how to properly express what I felt. And they didn’t know how to react. I didn’t know what kind of reaction I was hoping for. I didn’t want to burden or worry anyone. How often did I find myself alone in my room bawling my eyes out, finally calling my mother or my best friend, just to hang up 5 minutes later even more frustrated and miserable and guilty than before. They were only trying to help me to the best of their abilities, but somehow all well-meant compliments and advice only made me feel worse. I didn’t think they could truly understand me and it was so difficult to communicate what I wanted to say, when I didn't even really know what that was myself. When they tried to relate their own experiences to mine, it felt like they were comparing a broken arm to a papercut. When they were trying to give me tips on health and well-being, it felt patronizing, as if I didn’t know and try that already. This was nothing that doing a round of Yoga or 8 hours of sleep or being more social could simply ‘fix’. Just thinking such things added to my guilt and shame, because it was like I was taking their attempts of help for granted. Devils circle.What helped me most in the end wasn’t necessarily talking about anything in those situations. Discussing these things with a neutral person such as a therapist was a much better framework for me to sort out my thoughts without the added complications of emotional attachment. The greatest help for me was just someone being there and giving me a hug. Telling me that they know it sucks and just sharing a little bit of the suckiness in that moment.EDIT:How do you deal with emotional issues? In what situations do you share your thoughts with others? How does this make you feel? What might prevent you from seeking support? 
 When we arrived to move into the house, we seemed like an unlikely crew. There were three lads living there already - Kieron, Dave and Billy. Kieron was the leader. He had a drill. Billy was very pale and very thin - kind of morose somehow while at the same time desperately optimistic. He looked like he hadn't seen a vitamin in months. Dave on the other hand, was just mad. At this point, quite obviously, even certifiably, mad. Just a week or so before he had actually escaped from the psychiatric hospital over the road, bringing to mind a scene from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. And over the course of our time together, Dave told me a few stories about that place, that enlightened paragon of metal health provision which had held him body and soul for all of nine months. He told me how he preferred prison, because at least in prison you got a release date. He told me about the electric shock therapy, which left your mind totally scrambled for two or three days, then left you feeling more or less ok for two or three days but with no memory, after which they did it all over again. He told me about being chained to four big guys who were there to 'look after him', even when he went to the toilet. About how if he didn't go along with something that they wanted him to do, sooner or later he'd get held down and recieve a knock-out shot delivered to his buttock, which resulted in unconsciousness and a noticeable reduction in his ability to stand up for his rights. Essentially, he didn't have any rights. He was mad. They could do whatever they wanted to him. The detail that most appealed to my Kafkaesque understanding of faceless institutions, was that the refusal to accept that he was mad was taken as evidence that he was still mad. Refusing to take the pills that made him heavy and slow and stupid was seen as proof that his sanity had still not returned. Now you just try to imagine regaining your mental balance under this kind of perverse authority. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I'm not so sure I believe them. Dave's approach was to break out of the place and find himself a squat to live in with a couple of mates and several total strangers, one of whom had been recognised by Kieron from a free party, when they bumped into each other down at the job centre. Its amazing what gets hatched down at the job centre, and I'm not talking about anyone finding a job. But anyway, when we turned up at the squat, Dave was living on the sofa in the lounge in a haze of ashtray cigarettes and cheap cider, eyeing the curtains nervously and never far away from a large knife. You got the feeling he was pretty keen never to go back inside that place if there was anything he had to say about it. And he wasn't leaving the house, or even that room much at this time. Absconders from mental health institutions tend to be automatically served with arrest warrants by the local magistrates, and I don't suppose that was helping his mental health any either. Dave seemed to be doing pretty well as far as I could see, considering everything that he'd gone through so far in his life. He told me his Dad was always drunk and often violent. He said his mother had been killed, shot by a farmer standing in front of her dog trying to protect him while out for a walk. That was when he left home. He'd had a job as the look-out for a gang of thieves that robbed industrial units at the age of nine. A little later he'd gone to live with a family of Irish travellers who'd trained him to be a bareknuckle boxer, a discipline at which he was apparently quite talented. Some time after that he'd bought a house, back when they gave mortgages to people with no job, no credit rating and no intention whatsoever to make even a single repayment. That episode lasted a few months, during which time he acquired an addiction to crack and heroin, or 'brown n white' as it was known on the estate. That was when the mental health issues really kicked in. I could sometimes see the different personalities fighting for control inside Dave's head. So much suffering just couldn't be contained inside one self-image, so the ever resourceful ego just created a couple of others to help take the strain. I think it was fair to say that Dave was feeling the pressure. And of course, he couldn't go to get any medication, because he knew the Doctor would just arrange to have him arrested as soon as he arrived at his appointment.  On the one hand, Kieron and Billy were quite happy to have Dave and his knives living on the sofa. After all, this was a squat, and you never know what might go down. Sometimes you have to defend a place, and while Kieron liked his drill, that was about the limit of his handiness. And if anything serious went off you'd most likely find Billy in a cupboard. So Dave had his uses. And anyway, they were mates. But in this condition, he wasn't exactly easy company. So naturally, Billy and Kieron started to pal up a little. They shared a floor in the house with a kitchen in it, they went outside from time to time. They liked to get stoned together, and have a laugh. But this was unsettling to Dave somehow. He'd been mates with Billy for years, since the time he bought the house. He had no family left, no real friends after all the alcoholism, the drugs, the crime, and the madness. Billy was about all he had. And now he was feeling him drifting away. It all came to a head one full moon. It 'd been building for a while. You could feel it all through the house, under the neon strip lights in the corridors. Tension. The more Dave got wound up, the more Kieron and Billy retreated into their little flat. Sometimes you could hear him shouting incoherently in the lounge on his own. It wasn't very reassuring. But on this particular night, we found him shouting slightly more coherently, and it wasn't at himself. It was directed at Kieron. Dave was pacing the lounge, muttering to himself, wild-eyed. Then suddenly, something snapped. He grabbed his largest knife from under the cushions of the sofa and stormed out in the direction of the stairs. Larissa, sharp as ever, phoned Kieron fast and told him to lock his door. She was just in time.  'Yer fuckin big gay bastard! Open t'door.'  'Fuck off Dave' said Kieron, with his foot set hard against the door to keep his demented friend from getting in.  It wasn't looking good. Dave was stabbing the door repeatedly with his enormous blade, while Kieron, who fortunately for him liked to eat a hearty meal, was leaning against it with all his weight.  'Open t'door or I'll fookin kill yer both' If I open t'door, that's when you'll fookin kill us both, was more what it looked like.  The rest of us were gathering downstairs in the lounge. We'd known these people a week, and this was the only place we had to live. We were not ecstatic about the situation. And besides, we were worried, as much for Dave as for Kieron and Billy. We really liked Dave. He was a lovely lad, underneath all the addictive behaviour, the paranoia and the threat of imminent violence. I'd had a good connection with him from the start. We both had Irish ancestry. We shared a dark sense of humour. Dave's kind of funny was to make unbelievably hot curries, knowing that Billy didn't like them, but that he had no money and that there was no other food in the house. And then to watch Billy eating them, as his face got redder and redder, and his expressions grew ever more absurd. That was like Dave's perfect joke. So anyway, I headed up the stairs, with Dom close behind. The stairwell was pulsating, neon, harsh light. Nowhere to hide. Kieron's door was closed now, with the giant knife stuck in it, wobbling, and Dave half-shouting half-sobbing, desperately scared of losing his friend, his mind, his freedom. I wondered about his family history, and how much comprehension he had of his own emotional reality. It can't have been easy for him. And I thought about my own safety. But however erratic he'd been acting, I didn't feel any kind of malicious intent would be directed towards me. 'Dave, Dave. Dave man, it's me.' Dave was in his own world, and it was breaking down. 'Dave, what's up man? Why don't you put the knife down?' He kicked the door a couple of times, just desperate now, more than dangerous. My heart broke for him. 'Dave, you're bleeding mate! Look. Let me see that hand.' Dave looked at his palm, which had been cut by the knife as he had rammed it repeatedly into the door. It wasn't serious, but it was badly enough to make a fair mess. The sight of his own blood seemed to bring him back to himself. All the fight had gone out of him now. You could see he was ready to be taken care of. 'You should get that seen to Dave. You want me to come with you mate, we'll go down to the A&E dept at the bottom of the road?' He let me lead him away, still staring at his bloody palm, and I placed my arm around his shoulders as Dom discretely removed the knife from the door and hid it out of sight. The crisis it seemed, was over. At least for now. But still, we had an evidently pretty broken human being on our hands, and what the hell were we going to do about that? 
Hello everyoneI am a full-time community mental health nurse based in Ormskirk Lancashire. Since 1998 online Have championed a conceptual framework - Hodges' model which was created to facilitate person-centered, holistic, integrated care and reflective practice. Currently I am researching the model at Lancaster University in Technology Enhanced Learning. My Part 2 project involves evaluating the model by creating a new web resource to prototype specific content types, gather data and create some research interest. I plan to use Drupal to create my research platform.I have just posted news of OP3N on my blog "Welcome to the QUAD"http://hodges-model.blogspot.co.uk/- which also lists a bibliography:Jones, P.

(note: English translation is available here) Una rivoluzione copernicana a lungo attesa!Ecco, se dovessi riassumere in una frase breve e concisa, questo è quanto vivo e quanto vorrei trasmettere al lettore in merito al Progetto OpenCare.Diluendo più prosaicamente il complesso composto “chimico”, che costituisce al momento per me questo Progetto, non posso non focalizzare l'attenzione su alcuni elementi costituenti questa esperienza, attualmente agli esordi, che auspico veramente possa dare a ciascuno di noi la certezza di una rinnovata consapevolezza della capacità di ideazione, di progettazione e di realizzazione dei nostri desideri e delle nostre legittime istanze nonostante i luoghi comuni ed i pregiudizi tutt'ora radicati riguardanti le persone “portatrici di bisogni particolari”, piuttosto che “dis-abili”, “diversamente abili”, “handicappati”, “minorati”, “non autosufficienti” e tutto ciò che la storia culturale ha elaborato a suon di termini da etichetta continuino ad ostacolare il nostro incedere.Il primo elemento che individuo, già presente all'incipit, è sicuramente quello della sorpresa dovuta essenzialmente al fatto di essere chiamati in prima persona ad una azione “materica”, concreta, finalizzata alla costruzione di un oggetto piuttosto che di una più complessa soluzione che ci aiuti a superare una difficoltà quotidiana o ci consenta, più in generale, di raggiungere piccoli o grandi traguardi individuali in materia di autonomia, di integrazione, di partecipazione e di cittadinanza attiva attraverso il diretto coinvolgimento delle nostre conoscenze e delle nostre competenze.La storia del variegato quanto complesso arcipelago dei bisogni è infatti costellata da grandissime battaglie umane, sociali, civili e politiche che, nel corso degli ultimi decenni, hanno portato alla conquista di un riconoscimento degli individui quanto persone, in primis, di diritti e doveri alla assistenza, alla istruzione, alla integrazione nel mondo lavorativo e produttivo, più recentemente, sino alle più che attuali importanti lotte per una vita autonomamente gestita che riconosca definitivamente lo status dell'autodeterminazione - o della tutela - nel difficile contesto del vivere pienamente e realizzare compiutamente un progetto che vada oltre la “cura” da parte dei propri cari, oltre a quella delle istituzioni. Successi e difficoltà che tuttavia solo in questi ultimi anni hanno visto agire nei processi decisionali con un riconosciuto ruolo di protagonisti le persone direttamente interessate. Un cammino spessissimo difficoltoso, che richiede abnegazione oltre che motivazioni solide ed acquisite competenze sul campo, attuato da pochi in favore di molti spesso non consapevoli, iterando almeno per i secondi una sorta di continua delega in bianco in merito al proprio futuro.Un colpevolmente atteggiamento passivo, che caratterizza tutt'ora l'esistenza di chi bisognoso di particolari attenzioni, che la forza “destabilizzante” del Progetto può mutare risvegliando le coscienze di quei molti che potrebbero e dovrebbero veramente mettersi in gioco.Il secondo elemento intimamente correlato al precedente riguarda il ruolo dell'associazionismo “di categoria”, del terzo settore in generale, che in questi anni – ma anche oggi ed auspicabilmente domani – hanno garantito alle fasce deboli della popolazione una vita dignitosa e rispettosa attraverso la creazione, il consolidamento ed il faticoso mantenimento di soluzioni e processi sociali ed assistenziali in sostituzione di un apparato pubblico sempre più in difficoltà e molto spesso privo di sensibilità e visione rispettose dei bisogni individuali quanto povero di capacità strategiche in relazione ai profondi cambiamenti dei quali sono oggetto il sociale e l'amministrazione della cosa pubblica. Lo sforzo pluridecennale di queste realtà, che racchiude esperienze sia di gratuità che di iniziativa imprenditoriale e che attualmente è interessato da una profonda riforma istituzionale e normativa, nel correre del tempo ha prodotto purtroppo anche alcune storture, “deviazioni”, che se non in rarissime eccezioni contribuiscono nel complesso alla sopravvivenza di una cultura paternalista ed assistenzialista certamente responsabile del sensibile ritardo con il quale oggi affrontiamo le difficoltà globali e nel contempo cerchiamo di cogliere le opportunità offerte dalle tecnologie e dalle metodologie ampiamente utilizzate in molti ambiti delle nostre complesse società.Il Progetto OpenCare scardina completamente questo “visione”, ribaltandone completamente l'approccio, introducendo nei delicati ed un po' sclerotizzati meccanismi dell'assistenza e del supporto alla persona concetti e paradigmi mutuati dalla cultura generale delle risorse aperte e liberamente condivisibili da tutti, in una sorta di “fai da te” riveduto ed aggiornato attraverso la disponibilità di strumenti flessibili e potenti a costi estremamente contenuti, che in modo radicale consentono di riposizionare il singolo individuo nella centralità dell'azione trasformandolo da semplice oggetto fruitore di prodotti e servizi generalizzati e spersonalizzanti, oltre che poco economici nelle complesse implementazioni, a soggetto creatore di un sapere accessibile, condivisibile ed esportabile nella sua essenzialità.Una via percorribile, questo è il presupposto e nel contempo l'obiettivo del Progetto, che deve sicuramente sorprendere, sollecitare e coinvolgere soprattutto il “mondo” del bisogno, oltre a quello istituzionale ed economico sociale, per garantire un terreno “di coltura” favorevole all'avvio di iniziative e progetti che naturalmente rispettino l'integrità delle persone e delle loro legittime aspettative, che debitamente tengano conto del supporto e dell'impegno della collettività e che ne garantiscano l'azione solidale attraverso le buone pratiche di indirizzo e di governo locale, nazionale e transnazionale.Le più che consolidate tecnologie della comunicazione ed il movimento che si alimenta e ne contribuisce la diffusione e la pervasività consentono infatti oggi di realizzare una “democrazia liquida”, che sfugge completamente ai vecchi canoni conosciuti dalla storia, attuando con maggiore puntualità e concretezza possibili percorsi e processi virtuosi per la qualità globale della nostra vita. Il terzo ed ultimo elemento riguarda la mia dimensione personale.Da alcuni anni, per via di una curiosità congenita e di una affinità professionale, osservo il mondo dei makers con crescente interesse alimentato costantemente dai “prodigi” dei prodotti complementari che consentono agli “artigiani del xxi secolo” di realizzare oggetti o soluzioni sorprendentemente efficaci quanto semplici. Arduino, orgoglio autentico del nostro “fare” italiano, insieme ad altri nomi e progetti di caratura internazionale letteralmente “rimorchiano” quanti, come lo scrivente, ad un primo stupore e ad una prima titubanza dettata dalla presunta inadeguatezza reagiscono con un progressivo coinvolgimento in azioni ed in attività che conducono ad una nuova percezione della realtà, via via più plasmabile a misura dei “bi-sogni”.La mia disabilità fisica motoria congenita non mi consente di fatto l'azione diretta tramite la manipolazione fisica degli oggetti precludendomi una ampia serie di sensazioni ed emozioni che percepisco vissute nelle persone intorno a me. Tuttavia la mia intelligenza, la mia sensibilità e la mia creatività sopperiscono in buona misura ai miei limiti dandomi comunque la possibilità di vivere compiutamente l'incontro con questi inaspettati compagni di viaggio, l'Associazione WeMake prima ed il Progetto OpenCare dopo, che potenzialmente potrà tradursi anche nel compimento di un sogno coltivato sin dai tempi della prima giovinezza – divenire creatore di oggetti funzionali oltre che esteticamente validi – insieme a quanto desiderato oggi – realizzare prodotti e soluzioni di alta tecnologia nell'ambito della residenzialità autonoma per le persone con vari deficit fisico motori e cognitivi – nutrendo inoltre la segreta aspirazione di trovare finalmente una strada sulla quale realizzare questa mia importante dimensione esistenziale, a lungo in attesa di una autentica rivoluzione.
Zum Einstieg einer umfangreichen Feldrecherche machen sich Philipp Heinke und Milan Siegers auf den Weg zur Flüchtlingsunterkunft am ehemaligen Flughafen Tempelhof. Unser Team aus zwei Produktdesignstudenten -das sind wir- und zwei Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftskommunikationsstudenten beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, wie man durch Interaktionen zwischen Refugees und Locals beide Seiten einander näher bringen kann. - 10.30 Treffen: Philipp und Milan am Ubf. “Platz der Luftbrücke”- 11.00 Begutachtung der Refugee-Unterkunft im Hangar 1-4 (von außen)umzäunt und gesichert von schroffen Securities wirkt die Speer-Architektur      unpenetrierbar- 11.15 Wir lernen an der Sicherheitsschleuse zwei Frauen Anfang 30 kennen;Sie stellen sich als gute Schleuser heraus. Die Eine arbeitet bei THF Welcome und eröffnet in dem Komplex am Donnerstag ein Café der Begegnungen. Die Andere bietet vormittags einen Kaffeekoch-Workshop für 5 männliche Geflüchtete an. Zwei von den Geflüchteten sprechen wir zu späterem Zeitpunkt bei einer Zigarettenpause.- 11.30 Endlich können wir passieren und werden zum neuen Café neben der Kleiderkammer in Hangar 1 begleitet.Dort kommen wir in Kontakt mit Pierre Golbach. Er ist Leiter der Aktion “Tempelhof Hilft” von THF Welcome. Er meint, es mangele an Helfern in unattraktiven Bereichen, wie der Kleiderkammer. Außerdem würden vor Allem alleinstehende Männer aus mangelnder Empathie zu wenig Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Während wir im Café erste Eindrücke sammeln, wohnen wir der Abnahme durch den Senat bei. Diese werden von Anwesenden unter vorgehaltener Hand regelmäßig als komplizierte Bürokraten beschimpft.- 12.20 Interessiert lassen sich die 5 Geflüchteten die Philosophie des Kaffeekochens erklären.In einer Raucherpause sprechen wir mit zwei Kursteilnehmern namens Mohammed und Faris aus Syrien. Letzterer spricht bereits erste Worte deutsch und versteht auch schon einiges. Die Beiden erklären uns den Weg der Flucht über die Türkei nach Deutschland und sagen, Geflüchtete blieben für gewöhnlich 6 Monate in dem Flughafenkomplex.- 12.50 Die Security erlaubt uns für 10 Minuten Fotos in der riesigen Halle 1 neben dem Café zu machen.Die Halle steht - bis auf das Klosystem und drei Quarantene-Zelte - weitestgehend leer. Fotos mit Menschen sollen wir vermeiden.- 13.15 Pierre ruft für uns eine Helferin der Kampagne “Trialog” an.Diese sieht es als Aufgabe an die Bedürfnisse der Residents zu erfragen und nach außen zu vermitteln. Wir warten trotz angekündigten 20 Minuten rund anderthalb Stunden aufs Gespräch. Warten, so wird uns erklärt, sei hier Hauptbeschäftigung.- 14.50 Endlich kommt die Ansprechpartnerin von “Trialog” zu uns.Sie wirkt interessiert, warnt aber vor zu hochgesteckten Zielen. Priorität der Residents sei es, aus der Unterkunft raus und in Kontakt mit Berlinern zu kommen. Ein Projekt der “Trialog”-Gruppe sei es Partnerschaften zwischen Geflüchteten und “Deutschen” oder Vereinen zu knüpfen. Ein Problem sei, dass die Geflüchteten trotz umfassender Angebote oft zu faul seien, aktiv zu werden. Als Grund gab sie Unregelmäßigkeiten im alltäglichen Leben an. Sie hätte mit ihrem Team schon eine groß angelegte Interessensaufnahmen im Bereich “sportliche Aktivitäten” und “sonstige Interessen” gemacht. Einen Zugriff auf die Daten verweigerte sie uns. Sie versprach allerdings uns die Ergebnisse noch - grob zusammengefasst - zukommen zu lassen. Nach ihren Angaben leben rund 1400 Menschen im Flughafen Tempelhof. Ein Mal im Monat komme Amnesty International vorbei und gebe den Geflüchteten Tipps zu Bürokratie und Integration in Deutschland.- 15.30 Abschied von dem Flüchtlingsheim Tempelhof.Später machen wir uns auf den Weg zur Karl-Marx-Staße um mögliche Begegnungsorte für unsere Idee eines Pop-Up Cafés von und mit Geflüchteten ausfindig zu machen. Zum 1. Mai haben wir uns mit dem Konzept bei einem Wettbewerb zum Thema Begegnungen im Bezug auf Flüchtlinge rund um die Karl-Marx-Straße beworben.
Who needs care? Who receives care? Who gives care? Who is getting benefits?When I first thought about care- care giving- care receiving, I thought about the people who need care. Old people, Kids, disabled people. People who are helpless without us „normal“ people helping them, I thought. But there are a lot more ways of caring. Everyone has a disability (translating it to german its also: Unfähigkeit, Inkompetenz, Unvermögen- i think these words are really important to know when you speak about Disability). I need your care/help when I need to lift up heavy things, when I have personal problems, when trying to deal with soldering in the workshop, when I fail to motivate myself, and heaps of other things. I do have problems and I want someone to care about me.Caring is always an interaction between two or more people. And no matter if you are the care giver or receiver you are always getting benefits.  
In societys where we value  our actions after the profit we are loosing the view for the needs and gratification. Loosing ourselfs in the routine of daylife. Most of us even forget the impact our actions. Driven by an extrinsic motivation, pushing people into the need of  "gainful employment”.We've created and still supporting a system which turns out beeing kind of psychopat. It's a system based on the fear. The idea of not becoming enough. For what else reason should I then trade, istead of sharing? I'm not wanting to condemn, but whiching to have a view on trading itself in condicion of time groups.This article isn’t claming to be scientific. Just tryn to questionizing some strongly ancord habits. :-)….but before having a view on trading I would like to go a step further. Because what is needed before beeing able to trade is property. Property itself can be understood as something taken from the comon. It’s a resource holded by private/group until accepted trade occurs. Two maigor(possible) problems can be apier from that. Obviosly as soon as there are enough people trading, it creates a force. Resources you’re mainly able to resieve are needed to be in exchange. It’s creating a “need” to search for trading oportunities for your own service. Which is then aswell creating a extrinsic motivation, which then turns in modern markets in a direction where people following  “oportunities for a trade” instead of activities intrinsic motivated. Like that I find my self where a lot’s people doing jobs they would never do under “normal condicions”. Having more “marketpower” is then directly related to having more power over people.There might be many solutions to declining this trend. Me personly resonate quiet strongly to those related to the gifteconomy. Somehow I have the feeling while creating a gifteconomy it’s at the same work on all the habbits which let the world look like how it is now.It’s about sharing and collaboration instead of sensless competition. Same as it creates trust and connections towards each other.Taking care about something (someone) “just” because you want to. You do because you love to help and because you’re passionated about.But what if not enough people think like that? The world is already full of volunteers. And once more resources are free available again, more could do so. Starting with food:Everything you’ll like to do not alone you need people. Nothing more brings people that easy together then food. Everybody needs to eat. To have this resource free available could be a big step. While 30-40% of all produced food is wasted a good start is about preventing the waste while sharing the saved food freely. In Germany there’s since about 3 years a movent existing called foodsharing just doing exactly this. In this very moment we’re working on to turn it international. While this movment started from the idea of saving food, there’s still the main focus on. Step by step I would like to create a bigger focus direction eatable cities, community supported agricultre and freeGardens.If anybody is interested in here, just conntact me. :-)Sharing everything (you like to). For that we’re working on a open source multible sharing platform called yunity.org. But it’s not “only” about creating a plattform, it’s on the same about creating/supporting a social architecture brining people together with a focus on collaration. Once the MVP of the plattform is finished it will be used in first to turn foodsharing into a international movement.  Statement about communitys:...just some in every contry with the same intention, well connected could easily create momentum.Creating community/movement:I’m  looking for a team of 9-30 activists, interested in playing oasis game simliar settings, while traveling together and being filmed.I will start with in Europe. (if someone likes to do same/simliar somewhere else: DO IT! :-))Do we need money?One of the only reason why we may feel like, is of having a lack of connections. Once a network is big enough it’s self-supporting. :-)That’s something I’m highly interested to work on.
1) Are you navigating deep changes in your community and want to make sense of them?2) Interested in communities-provided care services (social, health, technology based)?3) Want to connect with peers and chat about actual solutions?OpenCare is a project run in collaboration with cities, maker spaces, research institutes, academia, communities on the ground in Europe, and especially individuals, which means each and every one of us. Starting now and throughout the next year we are building a community of Fellows with genuine interest in care and availability to share their experience and projects in different corners of the world.We'll dedicate Monday's online meetup to explain, ask and learn more about the Op3nCare Fellowship program awarding writing and research awards of up to 20 000 euros during the next year.As usual, the time for our call is Monday at 4:30 PM CET here: https://meet.jit.si/opencare (courtesy of edgeryder Eirinimal!) 
I'm Jean-Paul Dossou, from Benin in West-Africa. Some wise people do perceive already the unsustainability of the current health care provision organization in western developped countries, but this is the dreamed model, that developping countries are running to. Is it possible to "jump a generation" in the organization of health care provision in developping countries? This is the underlying question of the "modern" collaborative care expriences we are going to share in this post about Coeur d'Or.As a short backgrund, Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) induce yearly about 17 millions of deaths. Over 75% of those deaths occur in LMICs where risk factors are highly prevalent and the health system is poorly adapted to deal with chronicle and highly expensive emergent conditions. In Benin, the prevalence of high blood pressure is about 30%. Health promotion on this poorly funded issue, in this limited resource setting, requires innovative communication tools. To this end, Cœur d’Or (www.facebook.com/groups/coeurdor/ ) was created in 2011, to test the feasibility of using social media for providing promotional and preventive care against CVD in Benin, in a collaborative way.We aim here to present briefly Cœur d’Or , and some lessons learned so far. We use a case study approach based on participatory observation, (in) formal in-depth interviews with different stakeholders and documents reviews on the solution.  Social media analytics tools are used for the quantitative analysis of the profiles of the solution users and activity.Cœur d’Or is an open Facebook group of 21615 members, mainly from Benin (West Africa). It runs as a tool of keeping in touch with a huge number of the community members, allowing for a double-sense communication, spreading cutting-edge information on CVDs and building a community-based leadership on CVD. The targets are young, mainly from urban and semi-urban areas, educated and active on social media. They connect to the platform using mainly smartphones.  A wide range of subjects related to CVDs and Non-Communicable Diseases are discussed from several perspectives. Members can initiate a discussion stream, receive inputs from several profiles of members and get a summary from a medical expert based on key evidence-based prevention measures against CVD.The group stands also as a social mobilization and community participation tools influencing the agenda setting at the national level. It is currently a member of the Multisectorial National Committee against NCDs in Benin, as a leading actor supporting the organization of national campaigns against CVD in Benin each year since 2011.  Using its online critical mass and its growing network in traditional media and several public and private institutions, the group is capable of mobilizing each year since 2013 material and financial resources up to 25,000 € to organize offline activities such as a walk (about 5000 participants each year), risk factors screening, interactive conferences during the world heart day. All those activities help at reaching people that are not active online and are done with the leadership of members that are not health workers.The rapid development of telecommunications improves the access of a growing number of people to Internet and social media. A critical mass of the group improves its political influence and creates a web tool that can help for a viral diffusion.Cœur d’Or demonstrates the feasibility of using social media as an innovative approach for offering promotional and preventive care on health issues in sub-Saharan Africa. It opens new windows for thinking and dreaming again for an effective community participation in all its dimensions in the global south.Thank you very much for your comments and questions.
Having worked at SourcePoint Community Acupuncture on Dartmoor in the South-West of the UK last year, I'm currently in the process of setting up my own clinic in a town nearby.Community/multibed acupuncture, if you are not familiar with it, is a new model of acupuncture provision based on the multibed model common in China and Japan. Costs are lower because multiple patients can be treated at the same time, in the same space (in the US, reclining garden chairs are commonly used to keep equipment costs even lower, as in the picture above). This is possible because this style of acupuncture mostly uses distal points on the arms and legs (no undressing required) and, after insertion and manipulation, the needles are left in to continue working for 20 minutes while the next patient is seen.[And if you are unfamiliar (or dubious) about what traditional acupuncture can treat, here are some research summaries from the British Acupuncture Council.]This area of the UK has a lot of rural poverty. The town in question used to be a centre of the textiles industry and still has associated businesses, but now is mostly well-known for being poor, backward and depressed in comparison to nearby Exeter or Taunton. A walk down the high street reals the unholy trifecta of economic malaise, high levels of obesity, ill-health and disability, and that indefinable loss of spirit in a town that convinces every young person of passion or ambition to leave the area at the earliest opportunity.The main message is that Community Multibed Acupuncture can be an incredibly powerful intervention in an area like this. The effect seems to come from a combination of:1) Effective health care - I've lost count of the number of patients who have come in with stories of months or years of expensive National Health Service treatments that made no difference to their conditions, who then see a large reduction in their symptoms after only one or two acupuncture treatments. (Moves to provide acupuncture on the NHS over the last decades have been faltering and half-hearted, and are now suffering from a pushback against anything considered 'alternative' or 'optional' - which is a shame, as it could save the NHS millions).2) Humane treatment - unlike the increasingly isolating and interventionist treatments common in industrial healthcare, the effectiveness of traditional acupuncture shows patients that good health can often be achieved through minimal intervention, through working with the body rather than against it, through self-help, and lifestyle and dietary changes. Demonstrating that a more humane approach to health is possible starts people thinking about what else they need to question.3) Collective treatment - something about the nature of receiving shared treatment with other people seems to have an effect on people. Perhaps it cuts through the common Western idea of illness as something private, secret and shameful - whatever it is, sharing one's vulnerability and the act of seeking support and help with other community members seems to have a profound psychological charge.4) Affordability - although health care is free ('at the point of use') in the UK, it is, in effect, rationed; waiting lists are getting longer again, and many NHS trusts are effectively bankrupt. C&MACs offer a form of healthcare without the expensive pharmaceuticals, electronics and salaried consultants. Most either offer a reduced rate (e.g. £20) or a sliding scale (e.g. £10-30, where you pay what you want). [I've found problems with both models - resistance to the idea of a sliding scale is very common, and often leads users to undervalue what is being offered. Given that it has taken the District Council 2 months (at this time of counting) to respond to what should be a simple request for licensing, and given that the licence terms for this district are insanely onerous, I have found a degree of freedom and enjoyment in simply offering treatments for free and explaining to patients what sort of average donation is necessary to keep the clinic open.] If all kinds of healthcare were funded equally, acupuncture would prove massively more cost-effective than many 'mainstream' modalities - not to mention less energy-intensive and ecologically-damaging.5) Knock-on effects - people who come to the clinic see flyers and posters for other events while they are there. They buy a coffee in the cafe upstairs and bump into other people they know. They go into other shops seeing as they are in town already. People who had given up on the town are excited that something like this would happen there. Maybe some people even wonder whether there is something they could do to get things happening in the local area. These are effects that are common to any community venture, many of which other ERs have mentioned elsewhere. As with education, art, reskilling, etc, the fact that users of the service are making positive changes in their lives, and are already feeling the benefit of being involved, seems to snowball this effect even more strongly.
1) What is the problem/question you’re trying to solve?How to empower people to have a better understanding for each other through meeting on an eye level?2) State the ultimate impact you would like to have.- people meeting on an eye level- people gaining knowledge about each other and their culture- people learning from each other- people helping each other3) What are some possible solutions to your problems or ways to answer your question?- create ways where people are able to meet on an eye level- create ways for people to have fun together- create ways that people want to participate4) Write down some of the context and constraints that you are facing.- feeling of insecurity towards the not yet known- fear of binding/ investigating time- not knowing what the outcome would be5) Does your original question need a tweak?How to create a situation where people are motivated and have fun to participate?
Food culture in China vs. Food culture in GermanyWhen people ask me where I am from, I always need to think for a while to understand what they were asking for. The place I was born and where I spent nearly my whole life until now or the place my parents were born. I normally say: „I´m from Berlin (or „I was born in Berlin“), but my parents come from China.“ But it´s in fact a difficult question for me to answer. Because my roots are also from China. And my parents have been in Germany for such a long time. When I just say: „I´m from Berlin.“, sometimes they ask: „And your roots“? Last semester I spent the time in Jena and Kahla, which is in east Germany. There I´ve been told many times: „Oh, your German is so good!“ In Berlin I´ve been told this also some times, but not that often. I think the people there are just not used to see people with migration backgrounds that often. I can´t say it´s rude that they say it. Actually it´s a compliment!Before I get to different food cultures, especially the differences between German and Chinese foodculture, I want to write about the topic foodculture in general and how it leads toward communication. It has happened many times that after people knew where my roots come from they talk about their touch points with that culture. And often it starts with the food topic! There are many chinese restaurants spread in Europe, so the people get in touch with one part of the culture. Of course the food doesn´t taste originally like the food in China, but similar. They say: „I love chinese food!“ and sometimes they can even say some words, like „ni hao“, which means „hello“ in Chinese. I think that food is a good topic to start a conversation and also a good starting point to get to know the culture of a country!Food is a really big topic in China. While people in Germany or Europe often talk about the weather, chinese people talk about food. I realised that on my trip to china last year. The food topic appeared permanently on the way with my mum and her former classmates. But you don´t need to travel that far to get an idea of the chinese foodculture. Have you realised that in chinese restaurants are always those round tables with a turning glass plate on it? When my parents, chinese family friends and I go for chinese dinner, we always sit around that kind of table. One person takes a look at the menu and orders many different dishes for everyone. After a while the dishes, beside bowls with rice and a teapot appear on the glass plate. Then the people turn the glass plate to take a bit from different dishes. Everybody has a bowl, but it is so small that you normally take a bit from different dishes, eat a bit and take a bit again. Everybody shares the food with each other. People are chatting, eating and drinking together. If you are just four people you don´t need a round table with a turning plate on in of course. But the procedure is similar. The dishes are in the middle of the table and you pick what you want. With your own chopsticks or a shared spoon. At home we also eat chinese food for dinner and we do it the same way. I like the way of sharing food. The process of eating is somehow very interactive, because you also interact with people through interacting with the food.In a German restaurant, everybody usually orders for himself. You focus more on what you would like to eat. It seems to be more individualistic.Care through cooking and eating togetherI think taking time for cooking something nice for yourself or other people is also a sign of caring for yourself and other people. It makes fun to cook together and it´s also possible to learn something from each other. Especially when you have different cultural backgrounds. It is also a possibility to meet on an eye level. Also when you eat together, you have something to do and have the possibility to start a conversation - maybe about food!
What is care for me? On the first thought care is a feeling for me. Something invisible. From the day on we live, we normally experience it - e.g. the care of our parents for us. It´s not just a physical kind of care, but also a mental. We care about each other. We care about each other even when the person is not physically there. Care creates a boundary. A boundary between people. Care is a form of dedication. You need trust and love to care about somebody. Care means including someone instead of excluding. To know that somebody cares about you is really important. It gives you a save feeling. The feeling, that you are not alone.A care-relationship can exist between families, friends, people and their pets or plants, a group of people, but also in a society. There are many care systems in society (like health care, social care...). But shouldn´t also the people in society take care of each other? Actions like helping an older person across the street/ offering a seating in the bus,.. can´t be covered by institutions in society. These small actions can only be covered by people in society.But how to establish the idea of taking care of people in need in society? And how to establish actions of caring in society?In a society of care, care is based on reciprocity. People help other people in need and receive help when the time comes when they need it. Care is based on trust. But how to trust a stranger? For the stranger you are a stranger, too. Trust can only be developed by getting in touch with each other, by getting to know each other.

What is care? Who gives it?"The state is the main care provider", say many Europeans. And sure, the welfare state is a major safety net in their societies."Business is the main care provider", reply many Americans. They have a point too: their insurance companies, hospitals, and clinics – most of these are businesses.And yet, that's not the whole story.Care models are failing: per capita health care expenditure grows faster than GDP. We need to spend an ever-greater part of our resources just to stay well.Under pressure to get care, the edges of society (the young, the nomads and migrants, the precariat) respond by getting creative. There are many ongoing experiments, large and very small.A hackerspace in England provides a safe space and a sense of identity to the members, many of whom are unemployed, or disabled, or homeless.Hundreds of enterprising Greeks spawn a whole network of "shadow" clinics.Three expat adult couples in Belgium decide to live under the same roof and be each other's support network. Along this journey, they (and we all) face deep questions about what care really is. Is it services? Is it human attention and warmth? Is it trying to fix what's wrong with people in need of care? Is it accepting everybody for what they are, with their strengths and weaknesses?Care is deeply human. Everyone has first hand experience of it. Even those of us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receiving care.We are collecting stories of care... and using our collective intelligence to make sense of them. We hope to get to a shared view of what people are doing to cope when official systems fail, and how we can help the promising solutions to become more resilient and accessible to more people . So we have started building a community where people are sharing first-hand, personal experiences and deep questions about how we are currently giving and receiving care.  In the two weeks since we got started people have been gravitating towards one another in interesting conversations. Have a look at some of the best reads here, and inspiration for you to frame your own contribution.  Reflection card graphics by Ola Moller for Edgeryders
 The migration issue dominates the European political debate. The influx of migrants, some people say, will break the European welfare system. Any new person coming in is reducing the amount of care that others can get. Care is supposedly a zero-sum game. Is this really the case?It turns out that, when faced with care challenges, communities rise to meet them. By doing so, they step outside of our current paradigm, one of provision of care services by a combination of the state and private business. This changes the game completely to one of decentralization and reciprocity. These services often display an uncanny degree of efficiency. So no, care provision does not need to be zero-sum. There are unexploited resources in the system.  But they cannot easily be added to our existing care system. They are too strange: ad hoc, blurry at the edges, often existing in legal gray areas. Unfundable.In this talk at re:Publica, we explore some of the amazing care services that communities are providing - right now  - to people that the state and private business have let down. We then ask how we, as a society, would need to change for them to continue to exist, and to scale where possible. We will discuss, among other things:The economic truism that "health care costs can only go up, never down", and why that's a fallacy.The difficult relationship between care giving and management culture.Greece's shadow health care service. 68 clinics with no legal status, don't accept money and provide free health care to people out the public health care system. A large unofficial refugee camp in France that has developed its own services – community kitchens, a library and even a theatre!A makerspace in England with an incredibly diverse user base, where people find meaning (and income) through engaging with open technologies.This talk takes place in Berlin onWednesday, May 4 at 11:15. Session information and registration on the event website: https://re-publica.de/16/session/care-communities-non-zero-sum-provision-health-and-social-care.

   On 4 and 11 May, WeMake and the City of Milan will present the first co-design session for OpenCare project. This two-day session is based on designing of collective solutions on care needs.  Read more here (in italian)   http://wemake.cc/2016/04/18/opencare-primo-incontro-di-co-progettazione/  Opencare co-design session in Milan   4 and 11 May - from 6pm to 9.30 pm  WeMake Fablab Makerspace   Via Privata Stefanardo da Vimercate, 27/5   20128 Milano, Italy      Info: - opencare@wemake.cc 
 On Tuesday 19th, City of Milan and WeMake will present OpenCare to "San Gottardo Social Street". The event will take place at "Welfare di tutti" Space in Corso San Gottardo, 41, Milan, from 7 p.m.The purpose of the Social Street is to promote socialization between neighbors resident in the same street in order to build relationships, to interchange needs, to share expertise and knowledges, to implement common interest projects, with common benefits from a closer social interaction. To reach this zero cost objective, without opening new sites or platforms, Social Street makes use of the creation of Facebook closed groups.So what better place to promote Open Care than another "open" community!?
This is described as "a dialogic event for Health and Social Care Professionals and concerned Citizens who want to work together to transform Care in the UK." 
It was in 8th grade I think, when I heard my former best friend Tina say: „Ticking off to-do-lists makes me happy.“ I still feel the irritation that came along with those words. I just couldn't understand what she was referring to. Did she really enjoy this? Immediately I – as teens do – started to question myself: Why wasn't I that self-organized structure-loving girl that always got everything right, made reasonable decisions and planned her life 5 months beforehand?As the years went by, I began to understand that it was not the fact that Tina loved ticking off to-do-lists that  seemed so strange to me. It was the logic of efficiency, that I began to see everywhere. Peers trying to „get it all right“, to „avoid failing“. To master their own life as it was some kind of stress test. And to always be ready for the next job interview, a smooth and pleasing CV at hand.I was and I am a part of that. And it strikes me that this kind of neoliberal thinking of „your life (and your success/failure) is your responsibility“ leads us sometimes to very harsh assumptions about ourselves and our peers.I can now see all of that in a broader socio-economic context of destabilized markets and societies. We are all, in a way, facing much more uncertain futures than our parents did (while it is extremely difficult to get a full understanding of how this is just a perceived thing or really the case).Against this backdrop, the topic of mental and emotional resilience seems really a thing we should put our minds to. What does „real“ self-care mean when we are all trained to function? When spiritual practices like yoga and meditation are already a part of improving ourselves, being a good self-entrepreneur who, after a good yoga-session, can function even better, work even longer hours? I think sharing our vulerabilities and insecurities around failing, missing out and not wanting anymore is crucial at this point. Although there are already some great projects bringing these issues into awareness it seems that for a majority of people the stigma around for example mental illness, burnout etc. is still too big to cope with on their own.How can we turn sadness, unproductivity and inefficiency into an accepted part of life and how can we help people to cope with expectations they can't and don't want to meet?
You may remember that some time ago I mentioned that @Susa  and I ( @Nadia ) had dreamt up a new product design course format for product design students at UDK, one of the better design and art universities in Germany. It's called Hacking Utopia- #OpenCare for social and demographic change and was born out of our shared experiences as designers.More specifically the frustration with outdated design education that ill prepares students to be able to do meaningful work with their skills and talents. We feel that this should start already during their education so by the time they have graduated they are already up and running their own exciting projects that really contribute towards tackling some of the bigger challenges which affect us all.  After a lot of work over the past couple of months, especially by Susa, the partnership agreement between Edgeryders and UDK was finalised and last week we launched the first ever edition of this course with a four-day intense workshop.Over the next six months each student will be working on design research and product development process that departs from the OpenCare topic and methodologies. They will be doing it in synch with the phases of the larger OpenCare research project. The course participants' documentation and individual reflections from each day are uploaded in the Op3nCare Community Homebase where you are very welcome to leave comments helping them develop their thinking and projects. Or better yet: follow the course and take on the tasks yourself! it's a fun way to unleash some of your creative urges while maybe picking up some new skills...and contributing to the common good :) You may even be eligible for the new fellowship program we are building!Why do this? You get to see the OpenCare topic and challenges from many different perspectives and help shape the students research and product development work so they really are contributing to the Opencare research project. For the students getting feedback from you is an unparalleled way to discover new knowledge and broaden their horizons about what is happening in the fields relevant to all our work.The results of the students work will be exhibited in Berlin at Designtransfer UDK and it looks like some of them might run crowdfunding campaigns on StartNext.Opening: Wednesday, 20 July, 19.00Exhibition: 21 July– 24 July, 10.00–18.00 Address: Designtransfer UdK,  Einsteinufer 43-53, 10587 BerlinConcept: GastProf. Susanne Stauch/ID2 & Nadia EL-Imam/EdgerydersTeam: GastProf Dr. Martin Kiel/GWK, Prof. Jozef Legrand, KM Sarah-Lena Walf, KM Johanna Dehio, Valentina Karga, Svenja Bickert-Appleby, Ludwig Kannicht, Laura Straßer, Björn Weigelt 
Despite being child to parents who had both been refugees themselves, that part of their past has never been openly talked about in our house.They told me once in full detail and never since. Once in a while, they would share bits and pieces of memories from all the way from Vietnam to Germany: How my grandmother took my mother to the docks in the middle of the night. The boats. The sea. How my father was captured by the Navy. The "re-education camp". The second try... the good people at the boarding home they were allowed to stay at. Fellow refugee children they made friends with. Attending school in a totally foreign language at day. Learning that very foreign language in the evenings. Working - and eventually not only being able to make their own living, but being able to make another person's living as well - in other words, not only having a child, but ensuring a safe and promising future for that child.That being told, I must confess, I couldn't imagine how it must be to find oneself in such a situation. If I don't know their needs and wishes, how could I possibly dare saying that I'm helping with whatever I think that would help them?If a refugee wishes for work, it almost automatically seems like a matter of impossibility: "We cannot even provide our own people with jobs, how do you think you would fit into that picture?" Maybe, that was a misunderstanding. Maybe, what was meant was rather: "I'm tired of sitting around all day. I want to feel useful again. I don't want to be helped only. I also want to be in a position of helping others!"I once helped supplying refugees with clothes. Our group of volunteers carried box after box and it would happen that some of the refugees ask to help us. We would refuse their offers and told them that it's okay to go rest and let us do the work.I didn't realise at that time that we treated them like children, belittling them, taking their integrity and giving them the feeling of uselessness. Out of arrogant goodwill.So how can we care, without degrading them? How can we help re-establishing self-esteem and self-awareness, instead of belittling them? It's clear that they know better about their situation than we do, so how can we support them in finding their own solutions and learn from them, instead of imposing our solutions on something that we have absolutely no clou of?
Since the beginning of human history, care has been exchanged (given and received) inside homogeneous, durable and relatively closed groups of individuals. Families, clans, village communities, urban neighborhoods ... In the past century, in parallel to that, care has also been delivered by dedicated institutions: hospital, kindergartens, elderly residences...  Today, for several reasons, the demand on care is growing and becoming more complex, while both the traditional and the modern offer of care are less and less capable of coping with it. In our fluid, hyper-individualized societies, families, village communities and urban neighborhoods are weakening (if not totally disappearing). Individuals, given their life structure, have less and less practical possibilities to take care of others (even when, in principle, they would do it). Care institutions, which were supposed to substitute the traditional community’s and individual’s care, have fewer and fewer economic resources (and often political will) to do it. The gap between the growing demand and the shrinking offer of care is the basis of the present care crisis: a lack of care that is practical (the caring system do not succeed in coping with the care demand) as well as psychological (the sense of loneliness deriving from the lack of sense of care throughout the whole society). To overcome this crisis brand new care systems have to be imagined and enhanced. A first step is to better understand caring activities, considering their nature and diversity. The practical/organizational side of care is particularly important because care is more than exchange of information and knowledge. Care requires proximity and action: doing something for each other, taking time and being committed.Care activities. Care activities are quite diverse: they can be performed by whoever could be willing to do it (as shopping for groceries for somebody who is temporarily sick); they can require a lot of time, attention, and assumption of responsibility (as taking care of the daily life necessities of somebody seriously ill); they can require timely actions by highly specialized experts (as performing surgery in very specific moments). And so on.   In general terms, these differences are characterized by a set of main parameters: Time: duration, frequency, flexibility, … Space: virtual, hybrid, only physical, … Competences: normal everyday life socialization, specific diffuse knowledge, specialized expert knowledge, … Responsibility: very low; low, high, very high. Different care actions should be attentively analyzed and mapped using these parameters. Intuitively, we can already say that different care activities could be delivered by different actors in different modalities. To imagine a new care system, we should recognize all the potential caregivers and consider them as resources. Either as effective care resources (when they are already active). Or as potential care resources (when they can be activated under certain conditions)Care resources. In principle, everybody can care for someone else. He or she can do it in different forms (depending on his/her expertise and time availability), but all of them require attention. In turn, given that attention is a limited resource (each person has a limit in his/hers capability to give attention), this is true also for his/her capability to care. Care (both the expert and non-expert one) is a diffuse but limited resource. Presently, care systems are built on a mix of three main resources:Institutional care givers (based on professional actors) Third sector and charity organizations (based on both professional and nonprofessional actors) Traditional care communities (as families, village communities, urban neighborhoods ). We know that, for different reasons, all of them are in difficulty to cope with the growing care demand. Therefore, the issue is to reshape the system in order to permit to new potential resources to emerge and become effective resources.  Mainstream and countertrends. We have said that, in principle, everybody, depending on his/her time and expertise, could give some forms of care. But we can observe that today, in the contemporary societies, this care potential, clashes with the dominant culture and practice. In the name of individual freedom and convenience, our culture tends to assume a careless approach to everything and everyone (the throwaway society extended from things to human relationships). And: a mainstream practice of living that makes it difficult to introduce care activities in the daily life (due to work constraints, to the evolution of families and to their being scattered in different places).Therefore, given the present structures of family and work, few people can commit to offering care, especially if this requires continuity, high responsibility and duration in time.Nevertheless, several examples tell us that there still are several people who could and would dedicate some time/energy/attention to well-defined caring activities - if and when an appropriate enabling system would permit them to do it in an easy and flexible way.This limited but diffuse caring availability is the potential resource that the socio-technical innovation should be capable to transform in an effective resource.  In other words, thanks to an appropriate socio-technical innovation, it should become possible to cultivate and harvest the limited individual caring resources of broader groups of subjects. That is, to catalyze and coordinate existing but not used care resources could be the key to overcoming the crisis of care in contemporary societies.Hypothesis and visionHypothesis. If the close (social or institutional) organizations of the past cannot cope with the dimension and complexity of the present demand of care, they must be opened. That is: the care activities must be divided in smaller/lighter tasks, and allocated to a large number of actors, each one giving what he/she is capable/willing to give. Vision. Open care is an ecosystem of care-related interactions, characterized by being distributed among a large number of individuals, groups and institutions, with different competence, responsibility and commitment:  from the highly specialized actors and institutions to family members, friends and neighbours with no specific knowledge and limited time availability. ViabilitySocial preconditions and enabling systems. To be viable, open care requires two main social preconditions:The existence of a large number of other actors (relatives, friends, neighbors) willing to care for someone, even though they have practical limits (in terms of time and resource availability). The existence of dedicated and specialized actors capable of intervening when their competencies are (really) needed. Given the previous social preconditions, the open care potentialities are made real thanks to the existence of a technological and organizational system capable of catalyzing  diffuse resources, coordinate them and give their action the needed continuity. More precisely, this enabling system should:match different demands with different offers (in terms of competence) give different care actions coherence and continuity (from the point of view of the care receiver) promote and support both relational and the highly effective ones (i.e. the most specialized, professional interventions). be organically part of a larger systems: the ecosystem of interactions that represents what today we can refer to as a local community. ​​ Social innovation and open careThe open care viability is based on the existence of a whole stream of social (and socio-technical) innovation that is already moving in a similar direction. In fact, in the complexity of contemporary society we can find several promising cases (some of them are still social prototypes, some others have already reached a more mature stage). For instance:Circles of care: groups of citizen facing the same problem (as: diabetes, allergies, obesity, … or simply the old age) who mutually support each other, with the supervision of a team of doctors and nurses (a well-known example is the Circle in UK: http://www.participle.net/ageing ). Networks of care: coordinated networks of family members, friends and neighbors, who share and coordinate their efforts to care for a person with serious problems (a well-known example is Tyze in Canada http://tyze.com ) Intergenerational cooperation: organizations that supports the encounter of young and elderly people mainly around the theme of collaborative living (a well-known example is Prendi a casa uno studente (Take a student at home), in Italy: http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm ) Collaborative inclusion: organizations of migrants and residents collaborating to produce both migrant’s inclusion and social values, for both the migrants and the whole community (an example is:  Dine with us, in Belgium: http://dinewithus.strikingly.com )    Considering these diverse examples, we can observe that they present three common characteristics: (1) some care activities are delivered by non-professional actors; (2) the overall care burden is shared between different subjects; (3) specialized interventions are asked only when they are really needed.  These examples are interesting because they give us an idea on how open care components could work. Nevertheless, in my view, they are not yet the full representation of the open care vision. To better approximate it, two steps should be taken:To rethink each one of these service ideas adopting the radically open approach that characterizes the Open Care research. To consider the whole socio-technical ecosystem, and to improve it in order to give all of them and a multiplicity of similar ones the possibility to flourish 
Looks like one for @Nadia. Deadline for registration is gone, but it can probably be hacked.
Monday afternoon is when the OpenCare crew, community and anyone interested to learn about the project meets online for a one hour ofchatting and sharing ideas about designing better services for social and health-carekeeping others in the loop with how the work progresses in Milano, Berlin, Brussels and everywhere else where Open Care communities are growingmaking plans for upcoming activitiesWe document the sessions and post them online in weekly blogposts about what is going on, and where people can jump in to help each other (see Workspace).The call takes place at 16:30 CET in the google hangout, we'd love to meet you! https://meet.jit.si/opencareLet us know you're coming by pressing "Attend" below (make sure you are logged in).
1. What is the problem/question you are trying to solve/explore? Frame it as a design question!How to empower people to have a better understanding for each other through meeting on an eye level?2. State the ultimate impact you would like to have.People who do not know each other, but are open to one another.3. What are some possible solutions to your problems or ways to answer your question?Initiating meetings. Introducing them to one another through friends for example at a dinner party. Making them play together. The game as a heterotopia. Creating the conditions / the situations to laugh together. Positive connotated interactions. Having the same goal. Building something together. Having to design / build the dishes, cooking utensils together, a hut, the instruments to make music and so on. 4. Write down some of the context and constraints that you are facing.Time as something many people feel they are missing. The motivation to come to such events. Fear of the unknown. 5.

Day 1 Reflexions  We did groups of three persons (Anna, Cindy V, Luisa) two from product design and one from gwk. We start to talk about theme of People on the move that was basically in relation with our personal experiences and people around us that exactly are in the them “on move”. In our group we talked about the people that we know they moved to Germany to try to start a new life with a lot of difficulties but in the same time with a lot of dreams and expectations and how this people, including me, had to adapt their life here and learn all over again.We talk too about what thinking people in Germany about this people on the move. For example; how people help other people to learn about how works the things here. Experiences from Anna and Luisa and how they contributed with friends with a Asylum Solicitudes to find more opportunists to study and work in Germany.  We talk too about how is the feeling from German people about the foreigns that are coming, some people can understand the situation but other people are very heavy and close to foreign. We try to find many answers to understand why people in Germany having a negative reaction for foreigns and possible solutions “how people turn fear into trust”. I thin personally was a very interesting conversation because we coming from different context and was really god to hear about experiences from a foreign and from locals about the theme “People on the move”. Was important to know both sites to try to find many other possibles ways around this them.
1) What is the problem/question you’re trying to solve? How does the concept of care change within non-traditional family models and alternative living situations?2) State the ultimate impact you’re trying to haveGive people the feeling that they are being cared for.3) What are some possible solutions to your problem?                                                         Multigenerational living concepts, community meals, platform/space for interaction and communication (games, workshops, events, service exchange…)4) Write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facingDemographic differences in the definition of ‘family’ and ‘care’5) Does your original question need a teak? Try it again. How can we give people the feeling of being cared for when apart from a traditional (ideal) family structure?
Listening Triads - People on the move (English translation here).Hast du Erfahrung damit, on the move zu sein?Ich habe 5 Jahre lang in Guangzhou, China gewohnt – hingezogen mit 12 – wegen der Arbeit meines Vaters.Wie kam es dazu, dass er dahin ziehen musste?Ihm wurde ein Job angeboten – wir haben dann entschieden bzw. meine Eltern, dass wir mitkommen, weil wir uns sonst nicht oft sehen würden und es auch eine Möglichkeit ist den Horizont zu erweitern – also waren wir people on the move.Wie war der Moment als du wusstest OK ich muss jetzt nach China ziehen? Hattest du vorher schon mal Kontakt zu China?Nein. Ich fand‘s gut – eigentlich. Meine Brüder fanden es richtig scheiße – haben geheult und hatten gar keine Lust. Ich war traurig mein Zuhause zu verlassen, aber habe es auch als Möglichkeit gesehen Neues zu erkunden, neue Sachen, neue Sprache, Kultur und so. Was kann ich noch sagen? Es gibt so vieles. Es war auf jeden Fall schwierig sich dort einzufinden, weil der Alltag und die Einstellung sehr anders waren als in Deutschland. Also insgesamt, wie die Leute gelebt haben. Kultur bedeutet ja nicht nur Tanz und Musik, das schlägt sich ja überall nieder: wie die Häuser aussehen, wie das U-Bahnnetz aufgebaut ist, wie sich Leute begrüßen…Hat man gemerkt, dass das Alter einen Unterschied macht? Deins und das Alter von deinem Vater, also wie man verschieden den Alltag wahrnimmt und sich integriert als Erwachsener und als Kind?Der größte Unterschied bestand bei mir und meiner Mutter. Mein Vater hatte ja dort schon Kollegen/Freunde…sein Alltag war nicht so anders. Meiner Mutter fiel es schwer Kontakte zu knüpfen. Wir Kinder sind ja über die Schule eingebunden worden. Aber die Erwachsenen mussten sich selbst zurecht finden. Es gab auch Support -Organisationen, aber das waren dann kurze Willkommens-Veranstaltungen und dann ging es nicht weiter. Zudem ist es für ältere Menschen umso schwerer die Sprache zu lernen. Als Kind geht das noch leichter.Ich weiß nicht, ob das jetzt zu persönlich ist…aber was hat deine Mutter dort gemacht? Dein Vater hatte den Job und ihr Kinder die Schule, aber wie war das für deine Mutter?Sie hatte keine Arbeit….jetzt speziell. Aber über die Jahre hat sie sich selbst integriert in die Gesellschaft der Eltern, Nachbarschaft und Schule…sie war z.B. im Elternbeirat. Und sie hat dann viele gemeinnützige Projekte angefangen selber zu organisieren, selbst angefangen Willkommens-Treffen für neue Leute an der Schule zu organisieren, Wochenendausflüge für Eltern und Kinder und eine Fußball-Liga. Außerdem hat sie Bücher geschrieben, so Guide-Books, die die wichtigsten Dinge erläutern: Ärzte, die Englisch sprechen; wo man Schuhe findet, die groß genug sind, weil die Asiaten ziemlich kleine Füße haben, 38 findet man noch, aber mit 42 hat man kaum eine Chance, da muss man die Insider-Tipps kennen.Warst du auf einer normalen Schule?Wir waren auf einer internationalen Schule, als experts und sehr abgeschirmt von den locals.Was war das für eine Erfahrung? Gut oder schlecht?Beides! Ich fand es immer schon einen krassen Unterschied zwischen der chinesischen Kultur und meiner eigenen. Irgendwie ist es schon auch schade, dass man nicht so viel interagiert hat mit Chinesen. Aber durch die Schule habe ich auch die Option bekommen ganz viele verschiedene Kulturen kennenzulernen, auch die chinesische. Man ist viel rumgereist und hat auch schon einiges angenommen. Man hat sich aber schon  auch als Fremder gefühlt und wurde auch als Fremder angesehen. Ich weiß nicht ob das deine Frage so beantwortet…Hast du denn dann China generell als Land empfunden, das offen für sowas ist? Oder eher als ein nicht so offenes Land für Fremde?Mein Eindruck ist nochmal ein ganz anderer, als der meiner Mutter. Sie hat viel mit chinesischen Organisationen gearbeitet durch ihre Projekte. Ich hatte nie das Gefühl, das wir feindselig angeschaut wurden, aber es gab auch nicht nur Offenheit. China hat geschichtlich gesehen nicht nur die besten Erfahrungen mit Ausländern gemacht: Im 20 Jahrhundert wurden sie von verschiedensten Kolonialmächten ausgebeutet.Wie war es für dich dann nach Deutschland zurück zu kommen?Ich bin ja gar nicht direkt zurück, sondern erstmal nach England. Aber es war eigentlich, als wäre ich nie weg gewesen, weil wir auch immer in den Ferien in Deutschland waren. Deutschland ist irgendwie immer mein Zuhause gewesen. Reflection - Care on the move Gesundheit war ein Thema, bei dem der kulturelle Unterschied besonders offensichtlich wurde. Die Auffassung von Wohlbefinden hat sehr spirituelle und traditionelle Züge in der chinesischen Medizin. Man hört von riesigen Schwarzmarktgeschäften, die Haifischflossen und Teile anderer gefährdeter Tierarten für medizinische Zwecke anbieten. Auch andere ‚alternative‘ Heilpraktiken wie Akupunktur, Massagen, Pflanzenheilkunde und bestimmte Bewegungsformen wie Qigong sind sehr beliebt. Es ist ein ganzheitliches Konzept von Gesundheit verbreitet; alles hängt miteinander zusammen, Balance ist maßgebend. Die meisten Leute folgen Prinzipien der traditionellen Chinesischen Medizin, obwohl diese nicht auf wissenschaftlichen Fakten beruht und oft ineffektiv oder gar schädlich sein kann. Was hier manchmal als Aberglaube oder Hippiequatsch abgestempelt wird, wird dort weitgehend praktiziert. Weiter noch wird eher der westlichen Medizin und industriellen Pharmazie misstraut.Als Ausländer in China war es nicht immer einfach, die richtige Pflege zu bekommen. Kommunikation war die erste Hürde. Das Gesundheitssystem war ganz anders aufgebaut. Zudem musste man sich neu orientieren: man konnte nicht mehr einfach zu seinem altbekannten Hausarzt gehen, sondern musste erst mal neue Anlaufstellen finden. Es gab gewisse Kliniken und Zahnärzte, die unter den Expats verbreitet waren, wo die meisten hingingen, weil dort Englisch gesprochen wurde oder man gar international Ärzte hatte. Doch größere Operationen ließ man dann doch lieber in Deutschland machen oder holte sich zumindest eine zweite Meinung in Hongkong ein, dass durch seine britische Besetzung einen sehr starken westlichen Einfluss aufwies. Wieso diese Art Missvertrauen zu den chinesischen Ärzten bestand, weiß ich nicht. Lag es nur an der Angst, sich nicht richtig verständigen zu können oder gab es generell kulturelle Unterschiede im Umgang mit Krankheit? Wie unterschiedlich war der Stand der Technik?Was ich weiß ist, dass meine Mutter bestimmte Medikamente zum Beispiel nur in Deutschland kaufen konnte – auf der anderen Seite waren in China Pillen ohne Rezept zu erstehen, die in Deutschland gar nicht verkauft werden durften. Die Regulationen und Kontrollen waren generell anders. Zudem hat man erfahren, dass Chinesen aus Höflichkeit nicht gerne ‚nein‘ sagen, auch wenn sie wissen, dass sie etwas nicht können. Wenn man sich verläuft, weil jeder, dem man nach dem Weg fragt, dich in irgendeine Richtung schickt, wenn er die richtige Antwort nicht weiß, ist das nervig. ALs Arzt könnte so etwas jedoch sehr gefährlich sein. Wie fließen solche Gewohnheiten in die Pflege ein? Wie kann man solche Verständnislücken identifizieren und überbrücken? 
Globalization made us move and travel a lot. people are changing countries all the time. When you take a closer look at these people you realize how different the motivations of moving are, and  depending on the motivation how different the goals and approaches are. If you decide to go into another country because you are interested in the culture you will most definitely integrate yourself and be open for the odds and difference you will come across. If you are forced to move though, for example because there is a war in your home country the situation is completely different. So on one hand we have the people who are moving maybe even because it looks good in your cv if you have lived in Stockholm for a while and then we have people who are forced to leave their countries for economic reasons or/and because its dangerous for them to stay.So lets think about the people who are forced to leave their countries, lets say they move to Germany. Maybe because they have heard of Germany somewhere but maybe even out of a coincidence because the help Organisation they first came across was German and then they where broad to Germany. If you think about coming into a country without even finding the culture interesting beforehand you can imagine that there are a lot of weird things and habits you will come across. Also from seeing the other culture you will change the view on your own culture. seeing the differences will make you understand your own culture from a new point of view. like for example if you see people eating with knife and fork and you usually eat with chopsticks thats a moment where you separate from the others and realize just what your culture is actually about. This I find very interesting these cultures in cultures. I feel like there might even be a completely new interpretation of your own country. I can only think about food examples right now, like if you go to a restaurant and get „typical food“ and then you go to the country and they will never serve you that food, because its a new invention born out of a new interpretation from your own country and culture.What I find really interesting also is the second Generation. They are born in a society and raised by two probably completely different point of views. They inhabit two cultures, two languages, two patterns of behavior. I see it as a great advantage but also it must be super hard to find yourself between these two poles. So hard to make stuff „right“ especially if right here and right there are the compete opposite.If I think about my friends who are born in two cultures i have a deep respect for why they have already been through sometimes already in their childhood and what they are now. Its so amazing if you are able to understand two cultures and then maybe even distance yourself and analyze the differences. Take the pieces that you like most and combine them. Its definitely a creative task. Well thats maybe my naive way of seeing it because im not that much involved and even if i have been traveling a lot its very superficial and maybe far from really understanding something.What i´m asking myself is how to show what a great advantage the fusion of two culture can be. Not a clash of culture more a mergence. If you think about this in a really basic way a completely different point of view could probably open your eyes and make you creative. Hacking and MakingTo approach this task its important to firstly hack the habits of a culture.Seeing stuff through the eyes of someone else is a really good step. When i visited my grandma this weekend i broad an old friend with me. My grandparents house is something so familiar to me that i lost the ability to see how interesting they actually are and how much cultural value they have. My friends curiosity had a huge impact on me. We had a very close look at all the objects in the house and talked a lot to my grandma about the past. I understood my own origin in different way. And saw my culture through the eyes of someone else.SO the questions that I'm asking myself are:How can we show how great the merging of two cultures can be? fusion not clash of culturesHow can we overcome prejudice? or make use of prejudice?How can we manifest respect and acceptance?How can we be at eye level with one another ?How can we make people look through the eyes of someone else?How can we use the odds and peculiarities of a culture in a creative way?and probably a lot more to come..
If you give them a ride, but also if you take them in or even feed them you could be prosecuted.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/denmark-a-social-welfare-utopia-takes-a-nasty-turn-on-refugees/2016/04/11/a652e298-f...And this is a list of the many recent laws passed by European nations regarding refugees:https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/migrant-legislation/I know this is a huge problem with no easy solutions and I do not wish to have simple-minded views about it.  But some of these laws seem rather bizarre to me, such as:The Danish city of Randers made it mandatory for public institutions, including cafeterias in kindergartens and day-care centers, to have pork dishes on their menus. States in southern Germany can seize assets from refugees if they are worth more than 750 euros.Slovakia said that it will refuse entry to Muslim refugees, instead announcing that it would take in only Christians.
what does care mean to you?Umsorgen, Allgemeinwohl- wenn es Teilen einer Gesellschaft schlecht geht, für sie gesorgt wird (im Optimalfall von denen den es besser geht)- nicht nur wenn es irgendwelchen Menschen schlecht geht, sondern allgemein für das Allgemeinwohl zu sorgen Wie achtest du auf Andere oder wie willst du, dass auf dich geachtet wird?- nicht nur, dass mir geholfen wird wenn es mir schlecht geht sondern, dass darauf auch geachtet wird- ich habe immer das Gefühl, dass Care der Staat durch Krankenkassen dafür zuständig sind- ich denke immer an meinen Nachbarn, der ein psychologisches problem hatte, aber sich keiner darum gekümmert hat Wie carest du?- ich care so, als dass ich sensibel auf mein Umfeld bin- utopisches Endziel ist: dass es alle aufeinander aufpassen und niemand allein gelassen wird- wenn der Carebedürftige ein Gesicht bekommt und ich eine Beziehung zu der Person aufbauen kann, wird besser gekehrt Wann ist care keine Last?- Aufgaben spielerisch verpacken- Verantwortung verteilen- Perspektive: Aufteilung Notleidender und Helfender… dass die Rollenverteilung immer so fest ist wie trägst du dazu bei, dass der Einstieg von Leuten in eine Gruppe vereinfacht wird?- Austauch- wieder: Rollenverteilung: extern intern

 1. What is the problem/question you are trying to solve/explore? Frame it as a design question!How to not push someone to a place or activity but make it come to them?What actually pulls you towards something, towards doing something?2. State the ultimate impact you would like to have. What would make you feel like you did something meaningful with your time?We would like to understand what motivates people to do stuff that they enjoy doing.3. What are some possible solutions to your problems or ways to answer your question? Think broadly. It's fine to start a project/learning process with a hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprises.What does personal motivation in general mean? What makes people like (care for) something? What sparks interest and motivation in people? What creates flow?How can we break the logical answer mechanism in people? What interview techniques spark an elaborate answer beyond „because I like it!“4. Write down some of the context and constraints that you are facing. They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population you’re trying to reach.Since we haven’t decided on a population that we would like to support, we might face these constraints later. Though we don’t have a precise question that could lead to a fuzzy challenge. We still need to find a point to start a design intervention from.5. Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.What are the mechanics behind the moment/process of people being driven towards doing something they care about. It is about the point between an intrinsic intention and an action. 
My question is, how to bring people with completely different cultures, backgrounds and interest to a moment of human interaction.It can be a a very short moment, where people are connected and they are released in there routines again, but with something that remains. In the best case, it could happen, that it creates long term connections but this is not my biggest intention.I can imagine to build up installations (maybe super small but many), manage meetings, organize happenings (flash mops) and document all this for a exhibition which presents the activity to a broader public.It will take place in Berlin, basically because our uni is here, but it also is a awesome place for multicultural interaction. The challenges will be to coordinate many people, finding locations and founding the project.

Background to the storyTo those of us in the UK the Calais ‘Jungle’ has become synonymous with the migration and asylum crisis that has occurred in Europe over the past 2 years. It is frequently in our papers and on our televisions, yet beyond the UK and the direct environment of Calais the Calais camp has not received the kind of attention it deserves.‘The Jungle’, as it has become known, is a large camp on the edge of the Calais port area. It sits on top of a series of sand dunes, small lakes and wastelands on the very edge of the French coastline, right by the lorry parking area at the port. Before it was settled it was an industrial dumping ground, and previous checks of the ground have found traces of heavy metallic elements like Cobalt, as well as large amounts of old asbestos panelling that had broken down.On top of all this sits a huge camp for migrants and displaced people from around the world. At last count it stood at around 4900 people, most of whom are trying to claim asylum in the UK.At it’s largest point shortly after Christmas the camp had over 6000 residents. Living in very harsh, cold conditions through the Northern Europe winter.Originally the camp was made up of tents and very temporary structures. But from around September last year a number of new charity organisations and volunteer structures made it their plans to help improve the quality of the camp [http://www.ahomeforwinter.org/].The camp is largely made up of young men, although there are small numbers of families, women and young children as well as around 350 unaccompanied children between the age of 12-16. A number of organisations sprang up that work with the women and children on site, provided youth clubs, teaching and English lessons. [http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/camp-initiatives] [http://www.calaisjungleyouth.com/]The camp has grown up, physically and mentally, over the last 5 years, but has really become a focal point since around 2012. The camp has grown hugely during this time, as well as moving around from site to site.Alongside the humanitarian and social aid there are library and reading services [http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/jungle-books-library], theatre and arts activities [http://goodchance.org.uk/], community kitchens [https://www.facebook.com/OneSpiritAshramKitchen/][https://www.facebook.com/The-Belgian-Kitchen-1736739086546935/], hot food distribution, dry food goods distribution and daily clothing distributions provided from a central warehouse [http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/], amongst many others [http://time.com/4233206/calais-jungle-shops/].You can find out more about a numbers of the organisations that work on the site by visiting [http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/breaking-news] or by reading the No Borders document [https://welcometocalais.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/welcome-to-calais-booklet_eng_updatedoct15.pdf]Although MSF, GWB and Unicef run services on the site, and have provided some care to the camps the site itself is not officially recognised by the French or UK governments, and as such has no requirements to meet basic human rights, or follow local building or health and safety guidelines.As a result, no single government or NGO organisation has responsibility for the activities and structures on camp. Everything that has grown up has happened through self-organisation, communication and collaboration between new and existing charities both French-based and in the UK.Increasingly we are seeing aid, and charities from further afield in Europe coming to Calais to help, creating a multi-national series of solutions that have grown up without any direct hierarchy or guidance.In March the French prefecture with the support of the CRS cleared the oldest, largest section of the camp in the south. The intention was to rehouse all of the residents in to a number of local official options; including the La Vie Active container camp [http://julesferry.vieactive.fr/]; the brand new official refugee camp in Dunkirk [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12186407/Frances-first-ever-internationally-recognised-refugee-camp-opens-near-Dunkirk.html] or into asylum/detention camps around France.The majority of residents in the camp chose to not take these options as they are not looking to seek asylum in France, but are trying to get to the UK to reconnect with families. This disconnect between what the French authorities want to achieve with the residents and what the residents themselves want to achieve goes a long way toward explaining the conflict and central problem at the camp.About what i have been doingFor the past 3 weeks I have been working as a volunteer through the central warehouse, L’Auberge des migrants.L’Auberge acts as the central aid and food distribution services for the camps across Northern France, including Calais, Dunkirk and a number of smaller camps around the area.L’Auberge exists solely on donations, providing daily hot food deliveries, daily dry food deliveries to allow residents to cook for themselves, clothing drops, and since my arrival a mobile distribution service that goes from shelter to shelter, assessing individual and community needs and providing aid in the form of blankets, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, lights and a number of other personal items.All of these services are coordinated by long to medium term volunteers, who spend their own money and time to care for the people on camp without receiving any direct pay. Sometimes fundraised money is spent to provide accommodation and travel expenses to volunteers but a large majority of people live out here entirely on the own funds.The warehouse was initially set up by a French charity but is now run and ‘staffed’ by a UK charity HelpRefugees [http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/what-we-do/], who bring in funding and support from around the EU to help provide humanitarian services.http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/burying-refugees-die-calais-jungle-160329071028796.htmlTO BE CONTINUED.....https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CALAIS

1. What is the problem/question you are trying to solve/explore? Frame it as a design question!How do the differences between family relationships influence the concept of care? Family is the space in which we learn to care about other people and in optimal situations are being care for from others. Apart from the abstract idea of a close all-loving family, the reality often looks different and a multiple of imbalances can arise within and across different families. Viewing care as a fundamental good necessary to every human being, different family structures influence the social life of people and create misunderstandings across all the ecosystem. Someone who does not, for whatever reason, have access to care from his “natural” family, has to seek somewhere else, but meets the difficulty to be part of a society in which different types of care are structure and differentiated, i.e. typically hard emotional situations that need a specific type of care are dealt with the family members. Outside of these close circle, misunderstanding arise as why people should care and how to communicate the need for it. Different family-backgrounds often produce individuals who deal with their emotional life differently. We live in a time where family relationships are being redefined and even though alternative families (single mother, single father, same gender marriages, etc.) are officially being more accepted in the open discourse, the psychological and practical implications are being overlooked. For example, turning your friend or lover into the main care giver—role officially being taken by your parents and/or brother/sisters—still carries social stigmas and difficulties in assessing the fluid role-relationship in play. 2. State the ultimate impact you would like to have. What would make you feel like you did something meaningful with your time?Re-think the traditional role of the family as a protection-space and care-giver; deconstruct its traditional proposes and definitions and underpin the imbalances, paradoxes, holes in the system. Center care as an extremely important aspect of our lives, a fundamental good which can have a domino-effect on all other aspects of our lives when not dealt with properly. Create a common linguistic understanding of different family backgrounds and correlate them to the psychological and social implications they carry out. Care is a fluid good and can be shared without the traditional format of a family.3. What are some possible solutions to your problems or ways to answer your question? Think broadly. It's fine to start a project/learning process with a hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprises.The definition of family might be broaden or the caring role and relationship be redefined. At the end, the important aspect is to awaken a conscious thinking about caring and its connection to vital energy, well-being and social possibility with other people. The intimacy by which we hide some aspects of our emotional life must be addressed with the hope a post-traditional exchange system can born out of it.4. Write down some of the context and constraints that you are facing. They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population yo're trying to reach.Initially the question should be limited geographically and anthropologically to the western world. In future, a more global approach could be used. 5. Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.How do the differences between family relationships influence the social life and exchange of care between individuals?
      I am Moushira. One of the OpenCare crew from WeMake, and it is time to introduce myself :).  Once upon a time I was an architect, building and exploring alternative building techniques with communities in the desert of Morocco and the mountains of Sinai in Egypt.  Three years ago, I got a masters in interaction design, and then Arduino started to change my life :). Since then, I have been working on different things, including a project for an opensource laser cutter, called Risha, that operates via mobile phone.   I am also working on another project that helps introduce Bedouin women and kids in the mountains to smart textiles, and I am a consultant to the Wikimedia Foundation (the one that runs Wikipedia), working on helping find out what readers want (because no body knows yet, imagine!).          As part of OpenCare team from WeMake, where I am working on both the strategy and the harvesting of the online community and helping the people define projects that they want to implement. Moving on, I will help with physical prototyping aspects.  I believe Opencare is a wonderful initiative,  that reminds us of simple solutions that can make a difference in our lives, yet nobody thinks about them, because nobody knows those exists at first place.  Many thanks to @Costantino for offering me this opportunity.       I speak Arabic, English, French and Spanish (proficiency is in the same order :).  I am Egyptian, and these days I live between Alexandria and Dahab (a small city in Sinai)   Nice to meet you everyone, please let me know if you have any questions.Moushira
How to turn fear into trust?What is a rich life?How do  reduce the fear of people to get involved in activism?How to expland people's comfort zone? "chance is logical. People travel, then they come back but never change"How can happiness and work be put into contact with one another?How does the concept of care change with new family models?How do different food cultures facilitate care?Who do we care about? How do we take care of the people about whom we do care?How do people who have fears try to compensate them with certain kinds of trust?How do the differences between family relationships influence the concept of care?How do flexible or contingent situations affect care?How can egoism and care go hand in hand?Why do people feel so bad about doing care work?How to make care work feel like you did something for yourself?How to get people who are analytic, obersvant and emphatic to help people find their way forward?How can we make care work desireable?CAREeer has the word care in it. How can we make a career out of care without turning people into managers?Why don't we make a job out of love?How can we raise the socioeconomic value of hands on care work (e.g. wiping bums)?How to remove the social stigma around care work?How to make a person wiping asses into a big boss?How can I find out why care = Altruism?How can you pull someone towards caring, rather than pushing? (health psychology focuses on the latter)How can you lure people into caring (not nudging)?How to not push someone to a place or activity but make it come to them?How to make caring activities/ opportunities to get involved in caring come to you?What actually pulls you towards something, towards doing something?How to create a starting point: what makes people motivated to step out of their comfort zone? "love can give you the sense of home, can give you a bigger comfort zone"How to create the conditions for people to meet being open to explore and discover how they can build mutual benefits? Not starting from the benefits offered but creating the space for them to become visible/emerge over time.How to bring people on an "eye level to get the understanding?How to bring together egoism and care?There is always exchange between the individual and community. At which point between the individual and the community could you step in to change the behaviours of both?    
For me personally is Challenge 1 “People in move” very special because I was a people in move, I´m a foreign in Germany and I had to adapt my life here. At the beginning was not very easy and it was actually a adventure for me in my way to try to take a place in this society. The other is the Challenge 3 because when I try to find solutions like a designer and discover new skills in this way I think about Why I do this? What is the reason for all that I do? In the such for the answer I can find the most part of my motivation to work and these point is very important for me. Believe in what I do it means to me inspiration and power.
War is like a dirty toilet that no one wants to clean someone said...Violence begets violence and war is the ugliest human invention. For the past  4 days our lives here in Armenia have turned upside down...Things are calm in Yerevan but the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh is on everyone's mind. Most people know at least someone who is on the front lines, mostly 18-20 year old boys serving their mandatory 2 year service,  though hundreds of volunteers and army reserve forces are joining.It’s hard to shift my mind and concentrate on work at all in this situation...I've been idly browsing and refreshing the news (local - only official info that is of course censored, intl - absence of reaction and investigative journalism, and azeri- misleading statements and false accusations) since Saturday morning when the shootings began.Even though me and most of the people I know haven't really grasped the reality in this information blockade, this is war...this is what war looks like...and I do remember the consequences of the Karabakh conflict too well, even though I was only 6 when it started...First thing on my mind - I do not want my daugher to witness the horror we've been through...second thought - Armenian and Azeri people should gather at the border in masses and have free hugs...third thought - war is inevitable, this is the reality, people too brainwashed by their governments, full of false patriotism, nationalism and machism...peacemaking failed once again...We dance and send our children to fight the enemy, this is the only way...both sides consider each other agressors and feel the necessity to protect themselves/reclaim their lands....false declarations of ceasefires, provocative war crimes, rejoicing in the losses of "the enemy" just like in a football match and asking the gods to protect our boys on the frontline...and the international community that can only do so much  as to "condemn" the violence...Thoughts and prayers are not enough here. An escalation of this situation may lead to a full blown war that can set this region back for decades.As I am too paralized to form my own thoughts, I'll just quote some of the most objective and reasonable comments I've seen on the internets in the ocean of misleading and incorrect information for the past couple of days.We need all the attention and help we can get to spread the message out to the world to "illustrate that an oil-rich country whose leader sucks the blood of his own people to add to his growing personal coffers, who stifles freedom of speech and thought, who imprisons human rights activists and journalists, who spews anti-Armenian hate, who refuses to negotiate from a place of integrity is not a trustworthy partner. Show the world how Turkey has vowed to support Azerbaijan till the end. Remind them of our history and tell them our story. Our story through the millennia. Our story of struggle and survival and for our right to have our place on this fragile planet." Maria Titizyan"The timing of these events should not be a surprise. Azerbaijan's economy is in terrible shape right now. Their currency dropped 40% in value against the dollar in January. Their entire economy is almost completely tied to oil and oil prices are at the lowest point in a decade. Mass protests against corruption and a depressed economy in Azerbaijan have increased in recent months. Invading Nagorno-Karabagh is an attempt to boost nationalism and act as a distraction from real problems at home. All that plus Russia's deteriorating relationship with Turkey, a strong political ally of Azerbaijan, creates a terrible condition for Azerbajian to act aggressively against Nagorno-Karabakh."  Erik Yesayan"Armed with the knowledge of the history of this conflict, it is easy to discern that it is not in Artsakh’s interests to break the peace and renew hostilities. Instead, it is Azerbaijan that wishes to retake control of land which, due to the political maneuvering of a third higher power, temporarily fell into its hands but over which it has no legitimate claim." Aram HovasapyanRight now both sides agreed on a temporary ceasefire while Armenia's president is meeting OSCE in Vienna and Azeri PM is in Iran to attend a meeting with foreign ministers of Iran and Turkey...hope this will de-escalate sooner than later...Additional reading:https://goo.gl/ci3lFUhttp://goo.gl/x4XTSJhttp://goo.gl/j6jqUehttp://goo.gl/1jv07R 
English translation here.Was bedeutet für dich care?Ich würde sagen dass es auf jeden fall dieser gedanke mich wahnsinnig fasziniert, ganz stark ganz individuell bei uns selbst anzufangen und erstmal dafür zu sorgen dass wir in der glücklich sind mit dem was wir machen um das auf andere menschen zu übertragen und überhaupt in der lage zu sein diese unterstützung weiterzugeben an diejenigen die uns umgeben. Weil ich an mir selber einfachm merke dass ich wenn ich selber überfordert bin oder nicht glücklich bin, dass ich dann komplett zumache und gar nicht so zugänglich bin für die menschen um mich herum und ihre bedürfnise wahrnehmen kann und meine rolle erfüllen würde so wie ich das wollen würde. Und das hat für mich auch ganz viel mit den strukturen in denen wir uns bewegen zu tun. Ich beschäftige mich viel mit dem gedanken wie will ich leben und wie will ich arbeiten weil ich das selber noch nicht weiß. Weil die modelle in meiner arbeit oder uni mich nicht erfüllt haben und ich nicht das gefühl habe mein potenzial nicht voll ausfüllen zukönnen. Weil ich mich frage: für wen mache ich das eigentlich? Das war meist in meinem leben: andere zufrieden zu stellen, also meine eltern oder die erwartungen der gesellschaft zu erfüllen. Also eine gewisse rolle zu spielen. Und ich merke dass ich da einfach immer so an diesen punkt komme dass ich so blockiere und so einen shutdown kriege und dann einfach zwei wochen nicht weiterarbeiten kann – weil ich die relevanz einfach auch nicht habe etwas zu tun, das eben auch nicht gesellschaftlich wirksam ist.Diese trennung von leben auf der einen und arbeit auf der anderen seite finde ich persönlich ganz schwierig weil wir den größten teil unseres lebens ja mit arbeit verbringen müssen oder auch wollen aber das heisst dass die arbeit die wir tun, sollte ja auch irgendwie integriert sein in unser leben und ich habe das gefühl dass sie es eben nicht tun.Hast du ne idee wie das für dich funktionieren könnte?Ja, also auf jeden fall fnde ich so ansätze wie die sicherung der existenz, sei es in form von nem grundeinkommen, dass du einfach etwas tun weil du es einfach tun möchtest. Ich glaube daran dass wir menschen schon das bedürfnis haben etwas zu tun, an etwas zu arbeiten, nicht primär weil wir geld verdienen wollen, sondern weil es etwas ist was wir tun möchten. Und das rauszufinden, was wir wirklich tun wollen, das wäre wichtig für mich. Was würde ich tun wenn ich nichts tun müsste? Ich glaube, dass wir nie in diesen Zustand wirklich kommen weil wir uns immer darum sorgen müssen, wie bezahle ich meine miete, wie bezahle ich mein essen ... es bleibt kein raum mehr dafür dinge zu tun die wir tun würden wenn wir uns nicht darum sorgen müssten, was wir tun müssen um zu überleben. Gut und überleben... wir befinden uns ja schon in nem system das uns unser existenzminimum mehr oder weniger sichert, was ber immer auch verbunden ist mit barrieren und einem gewissen stigma....Das du dann auch zu wenig geld hast und zu wenig selbstvertrauen um das zu tun was du tun willst. Auch wenn du hartz 4 beziehst musst du dich permanent rechtfertigen für deine situation, du musst xy viele bewerbungen schreiben um dich zu bemühen, irgendwie eingegliedert zu sein und kannst jetzt nicht irgendwie sagen ich beziehe hartz 4 und mache jetzt kunst und schreibe ein buch, weil das system einfach nicht funktioniert.Care wäre für mich ein zustand von selfcare und dann ausgehend davon zeit und ressourcen zu eröffnen um für andere da zu sein oder andere in irgend einer form zu bereichern für das was ich selber tun kann.Also erst indem du für dich selbst sorgst kannst du auch für jemand anderen sorgen?Ja, also erst wenn du nicht abhängig bist von bestimmten sachen bist du erst in der lage dazu, für andere da zu sein und dein potenzial auszuschöpfen. Vor allem auch zeit, die zeitressource ist ein wichtiger faktor, um für andere da zu sein. 
English translation here.Leoni befragt PhilippAlso ich muss sagen, dass ich nicht in dieses Projekt gegangen bin und mich mit Care beschäftigt habe. Eher habe ich mich mit Hacking Utopia beschäftigt. Also was wäre ein Utopia und wie könnte man das Hacken? Also wie könnte man Utopien entwickeln.Pflege ist für jemanden da zu sein. Wohlwollend für jemanden da zu sein, wohlwollend auf jemanden einzuwirken. Ein sehr persönliches Bsp. Wäre von meinen Großeltern. Mein Opa ist an Alzheimer erkrankt. Das hat sich über drei oder vier Jahre hingezogen. Meine Mutter wollte es so stemmen, dass sie zuhause bleiben und nicht ins Altersheim kommt. Und Pflegebedürftig bedeutet Macht abzugeben. Und pflege heißt in diesem Fall abrufbar zu sein und so zu priorisieren, dass sich alles um die eine Person dreht.Manchmal bedeutet, dass Oma Nachts mit Taschenlampe einzusammeln. Oder Situationen im Haushalt, wo sie den Herd einfach angelassen hat und etwas Feuer fängt.Ich weiß nicht, ob ich das gut einschätzen kann, inwiefern es mein Leben beeinflusst hat. Ich war ja relativ jung, als es mein Leben beeinflusst hat. Wir sind bei den Großeltern eingezogen. Meine Mutter fand das gut, dass ich auf dem Land aufwachsen konnte und ich als Kind versorgt wurde. Und dann sind die Großeltern älter geworden. Mein Opa ist gestorben und meine Oma demenzkrank geworden.Der Pflegebegriff, den ich mit dem Alter verbinde ist nochmal ein anderer als der von Kindern. Aber beide Arten von Pflege – also Pflege generell ist mit Liebe verbunden. Meine Mutter hat mich geliebt, genauso wie sie ihre Eltern geliebt hat. Diese Liebe gibt einem auch Kraft und die braucht man auch. Sonst ist das ja schwer zu stemmen. In unserem System wird das Verhältnis dann durch Geld kompensiert. Aber da sieht man ja auch, dass es Mängel gibt. Da sieht man z.B., dass Pfleger die Zeit sehr eng sehen – sie sind für 10 min. da und nicht länger. Und dieses schnell-schnell homediensten oder Karitas, das sehe ich auch bei uns im Dorf. Da sind mal ältere Leute und da kommt ein Auto vorbeigehuscht und das steht dann mal da für 10 min. und ist dann wieder weg. Da stehen größere Unternehmen dahinter, da geht es um Jobs, da geht es um Geld. Die haben ihren durchgetakteten Plan.Der Begriff „Pflege“ ist der gleiche nur der Inhalt ist anders. Der Glaube – also nicht im religiösen Sinne – der Glaube daran, dass die Person es doch noch alles mitbekommt, was um sie passiert ist auch wichtig. Man denkt ja, dass solche Personen gar nichts mehr mitbekommen. Und da hatten wir auch Glück. Wir haben eine Pflegerin über das Internet gefunden, die meine Oma schon im frühen Stadium kennengelernt hatte. Und ich habe gemerkt, dass sie sich gut verstehen, als sie meine Oma zum Lachen gebracht hatte. Das darf man auch nicht unterschätzen. Meine Oma hatte auch sehr helle Tage. Aber das war alles sehr abrupt. Plötzlich hat sie nicht mehr reagiert. Und ich würde es daran messen, dass die Pflegerin mit meiner Oma wirklich Scherze machen konnte.Als ich meine Oma in der Situation im Schnee reinholen musste, als sie dachte, dass sie Milch holen wollte. Und ich will nicht lügen, es war für mich als kleiner Junge auch wie ein Abenteuer da im Schneegestöber rauszugehen. Und ein bisschen Angst hatte ich auch. Als ich die gefunden hatte, war ich sehr wütend – einfach nur wütend. Aber dann habe ich verstanden, dass sie einfach in einer andere Art Zeitzone war manchmal. Sie sprach von ganz anderen Dingen.Sehr konkret hing das Alzheimer mit dem Tod meines Großvaters zusammen. Früher gab es sehr strikte Rollenverteilungen. Als mein Großvater verstarb ist ihre elementare Stütze weggebrochen. Und sie konnte es nicht mehr verarbeiten. Sie hatte auch eine Art Schlaganfall, bei dem sie auch öfter meinen Namen gerufen hat. Sie war da auch länger im Krankenhaus. Danach hat sie immer mehr abgebaut.Die ganze Zeit über drei Jahre hatte lustige Situationen, schöne Situationen aber auch ganz klar traurige Situationen. Lustig war bspw., dass Haushaltsgegenstände versteckt wurden und dann an Orten aufgetaucht sind an denen man es nicht erwartet hätte. Meine Mutter besaß Kaschmirpullower, die meine Oma in die Kochwäsche geschmissen hatte. Meine Mutter war sehr ruhig in solchen SituationenBügeleisen angelassen, Kabel verschmolzen. Da muss man eben schnell reagieren. Und auch Verwechslungen, bei denen meine Oma Menschen verwechselt hat.Meine Mutter ist Grundschullehrerin. Sie hat versucht mich relativ aus diesen Umsorgungen herauszulassen. Aber wenn sie auf Elternabenden war, musste ich mich bspw. um Oma kümmern. Im frühen Stadium konnte man noch Brettspiele mit ihr spielen. Sowohl die Pflegering als auch der jetztige Mann (damals Freund) meiner Mutter haben sich sehr aufopfernd mitgekümmert.Wenn wir uns der Aufgabe nicht angenommen hätten, dann wäre es für meine Mutter eine schlimme Last gewesen, dass sie es nicht gewollt oder gekonnt hätte. Meine Oma im Altersheim zu lassen wäre sehr schwierig gewesen für meine Mutter – mit der Gewissheit zu leben, dass sie nicht da war.Für meine Mutter war die Situation natürlich schwierig. Es gab große Einschränkungen im Alltagsleben. Honey befragt Leoni:Wie glaubst du könnte man Pflege in unserer Heutigen Welt angehen?In der näheren Umgebung?Ich muss niemanden pflegen.Es ist pflege sich mit Freundin zu unterhalten.Bei dir selbst?Sich bewegen, den Körper Pflegen.

Auch bei kleinen Kindern. Wenn du dir das Objektive Betrachtest ist es sehr hart. Rund um die Uhr Betreuung, Nachts Ausstehen. Pflege ist nie Einseitig. Philipp befragt Honey:Habe noch nie mitbekommen dass es transdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit gibtThema war sekundärJede Interaktion mit der Umwelt ist PflegePflege beruht auf Erfahrung und die haben wir in uns, man kann den Umgang mit der Umwelt antrainieren, wenn ich mit der Weise wie ich mit der Welt umgehe zufrieden bin, dann ist es auch wie eine Pflege für mich selbstInsgesamt ist das kapitalistische System in uns ein Chaos ausgelöstWir stehen als Generation ständig im MittelpunktGesellschaft wertet ständig und Geld bewertet DingeMan kann keine Verantwortung für 300 Leute übernehmen und man sucht sich schon genau aus zu wem man seine Verbindung aufbautIch rede mit mir selbst über Zeitmanagement obwohl das eigentlich natürlich sein sollteDie Intuition wird immer schwächer, man muss immer eine Grundlage von Pro und Contra für alle seine Entscheidungen habenWirtschaft beeinflusst die Politik sodass die die Leute beeinflussen schneller in den Hamsterkäfig zu gelangen. In unseren Studiengängen entwickelt man dazu schnell ein Bewusstsein und versucht dagegen anzugehen.Tendenz zur Meconomy immer mehr Freiberufler weil die Leute realisieren dass sich die Aufgabe für Menschen die sich nicht um mich kümmern? Das gleiche gilt auch für die Pflege, man würde ja nicht irgendwelche Leute pflegen die einen permanent fertig machen, es sei denn da ist wieder Geld als KompensationIch beschäftige mich sehr stark damit ob man auch ein gesundes Unternehmens-Mitarbeiter-Verhältnis hat, der Mensch kann nicht mehr als 150 Leute in seinem Umkreis verstehen.Deswegen beschäftige ich mich auch viel mit Holokratie, wo sich alle in kleineren Holons verbinden. Sogar die Gründer arbeiten in Holons.Aber die Tendenz ist dass es wenige große Konzerne gibt, die alle Konkurrenz schlucken. Damit liegt die Entscheidungskraft bei wenigen Leuten die sehr komplexe Entscheidungen treffen.Das funktioniert vielleicht bei Lebensmitteln die immer gebraucht werden wo sich dann wenige Konzerne die Macht teilenDie großen Konzerne haben keine Empathie mehr und daher werden sie sehr skrupellos.DU muss ständig vernetzt sein und die Außenwelt fordert das auch die ganze ZEit von dirEs gibt so eine Sperrrate, ab 750.000 oder mehr kriegst du das nicht mehr mit, Geld ist dann nur noch Macht und es gibt nur noch diese Parameter zum darin denken.Sie oder er (der Manager/in) die pflegen ihren Machtstatus. Das ist eine einseitige Interaktion alles dazu herum ist Leere, ein schwarzes Loch. Menschen um sie herum sind alle nur noch Zahlen, egal ob es jetzt der Ehepartner oder die Assistentin ist.

Alle Interviews die wir heute geführt haben unterscheiden sich stark voneinander im Stil aber die Ergebnisse und Antworten sind alle sehr persönlich.  Die Details der Geschichten variieren und der Schwerpunkt, das eine ist politischer als das andere. 
The following is a transcript of a dialog held during a Workshop on Open Care in Sauen, Germany. Jan is a student of social and business communication, while is a Dennis product design student, both at the Berlin University of the Arts. We focus on the skills our academic background could contribute to the project, and how our different approaches and skill-set can cooperate in a fruithfoul way.Dennis asks, Jan answeringD: Wie siehst du unser Seminarthema aus GWK-Perspektive?J: Für mich ist das alles nichts neues, es entspricht dem, was wir im Studium zum Inhalt haben. Wir erarbeiten oft Ideen und Konzepte im Framework,um wirtschaftlich funktionieren zu können. Z.B. finde ich das Unmnastery Projekt interessant. Ein Austausch sollte stattfinden, so dass jeder davon profitieren kann. Best for both.Ich wünsche mir mehr praktisch zu arbeiten, damit ich etwas Neues kennen lerne, vielleicht wäre es einfacher bereitseine Idee vorgegeben zu bekommen und diese umzusetzen. Die Kommunikation zwischen GWK und Designer sollte stätig stattfinden,um das Projekt zu optimieren.Man kann Marketing nicht nach Regeln durchführen, es gibt kein Rezept, mann muss versuchen neue Wege zu finden und kreativ zu werden. Learning by doing wist immer wieder ein interessanter Ansatz.D: Überschneidet sich die Motivation des Auftraggebers auch mal mit derjenigen des GWKlers?J: Das unterscheidet sich von Fall zu Fall. Es gibt zwei Fälle: Man arbeitet zusammen und hat die gleiche Motivation am Projekt, nur daß einer eher die Idee und die Vision hat, während der andere sich um das Praktische kümmert; um die Kommunikation. Beidseitiges Interesse amselben Projekt ist quasi der ideale Fall. Wenn das nicht der Fall ist, ist der Marketer bloßer Dienstleister, der nicht hinter der Sache steht. 
Especially when talking to the older people in my circle of friends I quite often realised a huge fear or distrust of the unkown foreign when it comes to the so-called refugee debate. Even though these people are normally very reflected, very human behaving people, who care for eachother, who agree that every human being has the same right to live. How can one explain this contradiction? Theoretical constructs vs. practical experiences might play a huge role.In those talks I found out that it is a lot about missing experiences, missing examples. How to feel empathy? Already being told some concrete stories seemed to help a lot. If one has for example never travelled far, not experienced a lot of different cultures, he or she might be missing positive experiences in terms of personal contact, respectively any experiences at all. How can those experiences be created? How can they happen without being forced?While travelling we often tend to be more open or we rather take the time to get to know strangers than in our everyday lifes? What is it, that creates that different atmosphere? Can we trigger it at home as well?Does it need a connector to bring locals and migrants together? Another person? How can we create encounters which are based on sympathy and mutual exchange?
what can we as designers do? designing not only objects, but situations, societydesigning society.how can we create a community where everyone respects each other? helps each other?don’t loose the fun! if i am happy i can give so much more love to other people. What People? who am i in contact with? am I caring with a smile? how much does my smile give to the bus driver?what makes me happy?caring doesn’t only mean to give but also to be able to receive. to connect stay in touch. be authentic, honest.never loose the ability to laugh about yourself.  I am not going to change the world.  too negative I want to think about solutions that are sustainable and lead our society to better approaches.  better. We need to be working together and help each other. thats actually the only way to get out of this fucked up World. 
What is care? To start with such a question a lot comes to mind. Especially after this intense first day of our project kick-off at Sauen, with all these great thoughts, ideas and reflections about what it means to be a human being. I am personally fascinated by the cognitive dissonance I find myself stuck in. This applies to so many aspects of my life. Yes, talking is easy, acting takes effort. It's the same with design, having a nice idea over a glass of wine in the evening? No big deal. But bringing it into life, really doing it and going against all obstacles is a totally different thing. It needs energy, dedication, belief, trust, confidence, help. You need to CARE about it enough to put it into action. So that's one aspect of care. That something/someone has enough value or meaning for somebody to be considered with putting real physical action into it. Usually this is the fact when we are affected personally. When it's a personal thing. When we are involved. When we are touched. When we are concerned.The expression "taking care of something" as a German is a rather rational, dry and goal-oriented task. It somehow misses the core of its literal meaning which is a soft, emotional and gentle interaction. So how do we define this word? How does the culture we live in put it into action? How is it valued, honored? Who should we care for, what should we take care of and most importantly: what is so dear to us that we want to take care of it? Are we being taken care of enough to give something back? We discussed the question of how can something seemingly burden full turn into a joyful engagement. How can we overcome this cognitive dissonance and what is that undefined obstacle that holds us ​back. Because it's not laziness. It's not carelessness. Maybe it's a combination of helplessness (of where to start, what to focus), being overwhelmed (by one's own life and tasks) and alone (with an ambition too big for one person). And maybe the answer of today is community.
Today I had the pleasure of meeting and introducing students from GWK and UDK to the OpenCare project themes and the design (presentation slides available here). What follows are my notes from the final round of discussions in an intense day. Each quote is the transcription of what one individual said. I will be writing a separate post, or possibly even series of posts as the conversations were very rich and offered a lot of things to think about and explore around care.“It was a good experience, I liked meeting people from different backgrounds and the possibility for working together… Discovering what we each are good and not good at, and how they can fit together.  As well as what these different backgrounds creates as a perspective towards the project”“For me exploring new projects and ways of working is not new, so changing my setup is not new. Converting ideas to communities. Setting up a framework that people can work within. But for product designers is not the case. I could understand Nadia’s language well..It could be good to translate the language and vocabulary used by the OpenCare project into language easier to use for product designers. Designers are mostly visual, other disciplines less so. Some bridging of languages could be helpful.”“We were discussing the questions on the wall- what care means on fundamental level to us. Under which conditions care is being granted in a community and what that means for us. When discussing integration of people into a group, the separation you make in the beginning affects the integration project...You say there is an external person who should adapt to the community itself, instead of thinking about creating something new from scratch out of the welcoming community and new individials. Especially when you talk about care...you always do the labelling that there is someone who needs help, and I am one to provide help. Maybe getting rid of these labels is important. Also we talked about how social relations to certain people are necessary for providing some kinds of care. And how to solve challenges of providing care for people we don’t already know. You touch people physically (as we did in the opening session today) and it changes relationship immediately e.g. free hugs in public spaces: This changes something very fast. Especially in regards to refugee topic….Before helping there should be a contact, a communication with people before offering help whether you know they need or not.”“ We started different no thinking about projects, but our own experiences being people on the move. Being somewhere where you chose to goBeing somewhere you didn't’ pick: job, being refugee,  being moved by parents...how it affects your mindsetWhat is the difference between these two in terms of care on the move?One person was talking about being in china for job of her father to experience completely difft culture and not being free to decide to go there….vs choosing to move to a new city voluntarily in a city where many different cultures in Kreuzberg. Just getting to know different food and culture at a very young age and getting to know this in a playful way without much prejudice in your head”“We started off by talking about situations in our lives where we have given care, or seen other people receiving care. Who are those people who have taken on traditional care of caregiving? We quickly started talking about feminist issues and women being caregivers through history. We also talked about the rewards, how giving care is valued, if valued at all or you get financial remuneration…”“We were all answering the question of why we chose the different topics and why we chose them. Mine was about being on the move and the point that is for me very importan is the idea of doing something fo the first time and you have to cope, no matter if you have to do a job or ...you are always doing for the first time. Found a sory in newspaper about caregivers and they tried to set up school for nurses where they given puppets they have to be with for weeks before working with humans. Switch perspective. I found a flyer which was something like a manual for shopping in supermarket in the fifties..they were handing flyers out about how to behave and shop in he supermarket and now people are complaining about refugees not knowing  how to behave the first time...there is an arrogance... What is possible with products etc to switch perspective and lose embarrassment etc around doing something for the first time. People “misbehave” because. The first time I met a Syrian guy was during the refugee crisis, it was first time experience for both of us, no just him.”“We were mostly talking about first time experience of meeting some guys from syria. How can we start meeting people on a high level and not relationship that we are giving, and they are receiving donations. That we are both receiving and giving care.”“We started talking about experiences and what think about care, or what we need for our self to be cared for or give care. I found that we had really different ways of talking or explaining. I had difficulties to say what I was thinking and they only understood me when I made examples. And they totally understood me. But when Nema started talking, she could really articulate herself without giving examples. It’s really interesting as a product designer.”“We talked about personal experiences. Because of this we came to many topics- like how it is to be a European or come from another continent. It was nice because we had an open chat with one another, so we had some long discussions. It was nice to hear about other people’s stories because sometimes you don’t talk about it for long, but when you do it for one hour and you have some perspectives on how to give care for refugees but also what it’s like to be a foreigner in Germany.”“Unter sich haben sie die kulturellen Unterschiede nicht wirklich gemerkt, wenn man gemeinsam mit vielen Kulturen aufwaechst. Der einzige Unterschied, der immer da bleibt, und erfahrbar ist, ist der kulinarische Unterschied. Vielleicht ist die Perspektive eines Kindes die beste: Unvoreingenommen Dinge aufnehmen, ohne sie direkt zu beurteilen. Gerade als Kind ist es eine grosse Bereicherung, auf so viele unterschiedliche Kulturen zu treffen. Fuer die Erziehung und die Ausbildung der eigenen Persoenlichkeit ist es absolut foerderlich, in Konfrontation mit vielen Kulturen aufzuwachsen.”“We had a discussion about “stranger danger”. Which I have recently been having with people from older generations. When it comes to refugee crisis , even people I know that normally would act very human and never put themselves above another suddenly are afraid when refugees come to the country. In part it is because of the lack of contact; they don’t come naturally to a place where exchange could happen in an uncontrived way. How could this be set up, or how could it happen? We talked about how younger people can be a connector, how it needs a connector...there are many of us who want to engage but don't because the connection is needed and doesn’t happen without being designed. When travelling connecting is very easy, but in your own town you rarely have deep conversations with people you don’t know. Openness as a mindset is very interesting to see how society is structured n our head. How this huge fear that comes out of nowhere. Media says you should have fear now, that the new is threatening. I love my Grandma but when it comes to this topic I think omg we should not even talk about this topic and I have no idea how to change things. I think it’s a lot of empathy, we had a huge fight...it was all about him not letting what’s happen...not wanting to feel it...keeping it theoretical. The next day there was a change of perspective. It’s also overwhelming for many people, related to make yourself vulnerable and allowing yourself to feel. It’s a very delicate and sensitive how to do this contact and get them in touch with their feelings.”“We were talking about different languages. To map out what we can as GWK and product designers (UDK) and to figure out what is the responsibility towards what we are studying. Until now what designers were doing and what we were studying was just about making things beautiful. Are we even responsible towards building towards big visions the way  OpenCare is doing? As designers we are always looked upon in a very belittling way - as though we are not capable of contributing to the big issues. But I believe it is part of our responsibility as designers to do this work, because ideally we are focusing not on profiting from it but we can do it just to help. Everyone knows we should help, but no one really does it and people still have prejudices and discriminate. Not many of us know how it is to lead a refugee’s life. How many of us have been discriminated against? For me I was born in Germany, but for a moment I thought well all the refugee circus that is going on has nothing to do with me and I thought it is the responsibility of larger organisations like NGos and the Government to deal with...I asked myself what capacity do I realistically have to help. Then I realised that as someone born in Germany, I walk around the street I hear people discriminating against Asians. And I realised it does affect me, and it is my responsibility to help...It is about the right to be a creative and work not just for profit, but  to help others and how this is deeply human at its core.”“I think it is always important to find new symbiotic relationships between people. One Project I’ve come across is one in which there were two groups: one group who wanted to learn English but didnt have connections to do so, and the other group was old lonely group from America. These two groups were able to talk to each other via skype. The Old people had the joy of talking to somebody who was interested in learning. And the young people learned English. It’s very nice to see people caring about each other that way.”“For me it was very interesting to hear what makes something seem foreign and why we feel home. What makes this happen?”“We were still thinking about what is th goal of being a designer and what is a design process...what is the difference to art or to management/managers job? We came to the point that an artist is focusing on showing problem and designer is trying to find solution and manager is more focused on company’s project and not so much on helping people. It’s a beginning of a discussion.”“We were not talking about the differences between student areas. It was interesting seeing how there was a lot of variation in how interviews were conducted in the different groups as well as within the group were different. I think what I found was that we had very different styles of leading interviews and how different results. I realised I am used to lead an interview and how it has become my only way for me. And it was really interesting to see there are different kinds of ways to lead an interview. I learned how to lead interviews in design thinking...you are asking for stories and ask 5 times why. It’s completely differnt thing when trying to understand a person. It was a very good experience. And apart from that my main insight is that care is always interactional, its not a one way street. The system of capitalism is making it a one way street because there s wlays money in and something out. It’s not evolutionary.”“We talked about the relationships that we have with people from Syria that we know and the experiences we have with them. We try to know why German people are so scared of foreigners and why the German people are sometimes so closed also in a friendship. For example my first time was not so easy to make friends here, german people are really closed the first time..they are not so open to stangers.”“It was really intersting hearing about your experiences and the difficulties you had. Very interesting to talk from a personal perspectives and the fears you have.”“We discussed the five questions we were given. What I noticed te most that care is a very difficult term. We couldn;t find a term for care in german. This is one part that makes the discussion very interesting but also very difficult. A whole lot of people are going in a direction towards the refugee topic, that seems to be very close to people. I heard about a book from two journalists about political language: some words and terms that are used are producing certain realities. When you use some words regularly especially in the media, it becomes a reality and then there is no alternative. Translating care into a german word, and speaking about it means very different thing.” “We also tried to approach the topic from a more general angle, what care really means for us. We came to conclusion that care, giving and receiving, is a basic human need and a human right. It’s not a one-way street, but we need to talk about care as a devalued thing in our society. There are people who really love to give are and do not have the right to get something for it. We thought about how to make people who give care more visible. How can we provide some kind of reward or value for the volunteers. And of course we went in the feminist direction but I think it is a really important thing to value care as a huge thing in society.”“Care which we translated into Pfleger. Has not only to do with caring about other people and also for yourself. Is it important to care for yourself first or the other way around? It’s a challenge to care for huge number of people at once. Monetization and how it affects our view on people around us: that we cannot be more intuitive because we think about how we can be most effective.This question where german politicians are saying we have to take care of our people, and not just give everything away. Same thing at a different scale. We have to look at how we distributed in different ways. I would like to see politicians say how they care for themselves, I would like to see them living a lifestyle which shows people how to live a healthy life.” 
Das erste Mal sind Erfahrungen, die ganz wichtig sind. On the Move… Ich habe mich auf die Suche gemacht, Piloten, wie kommt man zum Fliegen, wenn es das vorher nochmal gibt. Badewanne, Simulation, Myelin, Nervenband im Kopf verbunden, am Anfang sind da keine Verbindungen, wenn das erste Mal eine geschaffen wird, wird Myelin abgelagert, umwickelt, je häufiger das passiert, desto schneller funktionieren die Kanäle. Immer das was fremd ist tut weh. Das erste Mal tut immer weh. Beim Kartenspiel. Das erste Mal verliert man. So ist das auch mit Flüchtlingen. Die grüne Kiste. Wir hatten eine in der WG. Dann haben wir darüber nachgedacht, was ist, wenn wir nicht mehr einkaufen gehen. Es gab früher Karten mit Anleitungen. Das ist 50 Jahre her. Das müssen wir den Flüchtlingen jetzt auch erklären.Ich habe für eine Organisation gearbeitet. Social Impact Lab. Original Unverpackt, das kennt jeder, kommt daher. Ich habe die Leute betreut und ihnen geholfen, ihre Ideen umzusetzen. Wie mit dem Mühlen. Die ersten Ideen sind oft die besten. Frage: Ist nicht Scheitern eines der besten Prinzipien unserer Gesellschaft? Diese ganzen Diskurse, die dazu geführt werden. In den 70ern, die Hippie Bewegung, dann Wallstreit, jetzt ist Scheitern geil. Scheitern ist nicht geil, das gehört dazu, man darf Scheitern nicht zum Ideal erheben. Wenn das passiert verfällt man in Aktionismus. Scheitern gehört dazu und ist auch wichtig, aber man darf es nicht erheben und das passiert gerade. Das zweite zum Scheitern. Ich wollte mal einen Simulator zum Gründen bauen. Was passiert, wenn man in einem Workshop simuliert zu scheitern. Was ist, wenn man dann nicht mehr in der Realität scheitern muss? Die erste Mal Logik versuchen aufzunehmen und daraus zu machen. Genau, erste Mal, Altenpfleger, Krankenpfleger etc. sollen zukünftig gemeinsam ausgebildet werden. Dafür wurden jetzt diese Puppen entwickelt.. Das ist abgefahren, alles muss jetzt generalisiert werden. So ein normalisierter Ansatz macht keinen Sinn. Ein Artikel aus der Zeit.Frage: Übertragung vom ersten Mal scheitern, wie würdest du das im sozialen oder im Open Care Kontext einordnen? On the Move kommst du ja immer wieder in neue Kontexte. Deswegen würde ich nicht gerne von Flüchtlingen reden. Welche Infrastrukturen, Apps, Brillen usw. braucht man, um den ersten Malen zu begegnen?Frage: Es gibt zwei verschiedne Perspektiven. Das Beispiel mit dem Supermarkt war einleuchtend. Wir haben alle diese Erfahrung schon gemacht.Es gibt eine Dokumentation mit Arno Stern, die gut ist. Der macht freie Malkurse. In der Doku kommt sein Sohn vor. Den hat er komplett ohne Schule aufgezogen und somit seine Neugierde erhalten. Er hatte nie das Gefühl dumme Fragen stellen zu können und hat immer aus dem Gefühl etwas Neues zu machen eine Motivation gezogen. Wir entwickeln eine Sicherheit durch Wiederholung und Angst vorm Scheitern. Bei ihm ist das andersherum.Frage: Habe ich das richtig verstanden? Du hast den Mut zum Scheitern oder versuchst ihm aus dem wegzugehen?Ne, wie kann man das hinkriegen, dass dieses Scheitern ist, das fruchtbar ist und weniger wehtut. Wie kann man daraus wirklich lernen. Frage: Aber der Typ, von dem du erzählt hast, der lernt doch?Ja ja, aber sein Motiv ist es zu lernen, nicht zu scheitern.

For most of humanity's history, care services – which today we call health and social care – were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other's children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people…) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?We are going to attempt to do just that. We are launching OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. We will:collect experiences of community-driven care services validate them through open discussion, both online and offline.augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking…)combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services.This is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we'll do it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process will be – and stay – open to anyone who wants to participate. We are working on a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution, and will not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.Care is deeply human. Everyone has first-hand experience of it. Even those if us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receving care. So, everyone is welcome to join the conversation and the subsequent prototypes. If you want to be involved you can stay up to date through the newsletter, sign up to Edgeryders and come talk to us on our workspace.OpenCare is led by YOU, and assisted by a world-class partnership: Edgeryders, the University of Bordeaux, the City of Milan, WeMake, ScImpulse Foundation and the Stockholm School of Economics. We are grateful for the support of the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme. 
In one of his darkly observant essays on the fall of the Soviet Union and its lessons for present-day America, Dmitri Orlov advises against being a successful middle-aged man : When their career is suddenly over, their savings gone and their property worthless, much of their sense of self-worth goes as well. They tend to drink themselves to death and commit suicide in disproportionate numbers. Since they tend to be the most experienced and capable people, this is a staggering loss to society. (Reinventing Collapse, p.122-3)The spike in mortality that accompanied the fall of the Soviet Union has few parallels in history. Between 1987 and 1994, life expectancy dropped from 70 to 64, and the group whose likelihood of dying increased most sharply was, indeed, working age men. In other words, despite the material hardships of the period, it was not the weakest and most vulnerable who died in greater numbers, but the physically strong: what was most deadly about the collapse was not the disappearance of the means of staying alive, but the lack of ends for which to stay alive.Europe is not going through a Soviet-style collapse. (Or not yet: a report from UBS Investment Research in September 2011 estimated the costs of a break-up of the Eurozone at 40-50% of weaker countries’ GDP in the first year and 20-25% of the GDP of countries like Germany. For comparison, the total fall in GDP during the break-up of the USSR is estimated at 45%, spread over the years from 1989 to 1998.) The point I want to draw from Orlov, however, is that there is a powerful and complex interrelation between how we make a living and how we make sense of our lives. The consequences of an economic crisis can both lead to and be made worse by the crisis of meaning experienced by those whose lives it has derailed. If this is the case, however, perhaps it is also possible that action on the level of meaning might stem and even reverse the consequences, personal and social, of failing economic systems?The figure of the ‘graduate with no future’, identified by Paul Mason, has the advantage of youth, yet in other ways she resembles Orlov’s successful middle-aged man. People are capable of enduring great hardship, so long as they can find meaning in their situation, but it is hard to find meaning in the hundredth rejection letter. The feeling of having done everything right and still got nowhere leads to a particular desperation. Against this background, the actions of those who might identify with Mason’s description - whether as indignados in the squares of Spain, or as Edgeryders entering the corridors of Strasbourg and Brussels - are not least a search for meaning, for new frameworks in which to make sense of our lives when the promises that framed the labour market for our parents no longer ring true. Four years ago, in ‘The Future of Unemployment’, I suggested that it might be helpful to distinguish three types of need which, broadly speaking, we have looked to employment to provide. I want to return to this model as a way of structuring a search for examples of effective action on the level of meaning. Departing slightly from the original terms, I would summarise these types of need as follows:Economic/Practical: How do I pay the rent?Social/Psychological: Who am I in the eyes of others?Directional: What do I get out of bed for in the morning? And where do I see myself in the future?Those who find it difficult to access the labour market are also likely to find answering these questions more difficult. The stories shared on the Edgeryders platform during 2011-12 illustrate the variety of ways in which young people find their access the labour market limited: not only through unemployment, but underemployment, casualisation and the prevalence of short-term contracts, the increasing cost of education in certain countries, the role of unpaid internships as a path to accessing certain industries. Where skills and qualifications have been acquired through formal education, many find themselves unable to secure work that makes use of these; where skills are acquired informally, the challenge is to represent these effectively to potential employers. Above all, the situation is defined by the interaction between two major processes: a long-term change in the structure of European labour markets, offering new entrants a poorer deal than had been the case for their parents’ generation, has been exacerbated by the effects of the economic crisis that began in 2008.If the situation of those struggling to access the labour market can be expressed in terms of the three types of need set out above, we might note that the last two belong primarily to the domain of meaning: our ability to answer them is closely related to our ability to make sense of our lives. Based on this, I suggest that we look for two stages in projects that might constitute effective action on the level of meaning: first, the ability to substitute for employment in providing social identity and a sense of direction; and, second, the potential for this to lead to new means of meeting practical needs.With this structure in mind, I want to consider briefly a few examples which I think offer clues to what this may look like in practice.Centers for New Work: During the collapse in employment in the US auto industry in the early 1980s, the philosopher Frithjof Bergmann worked with employers, unions and community organisations in Flint, Michigan to create the Center for New Work. ‘We are in the beginning of a great scarcity of jobs,’ Bergmann argued, ‘but not of work.’ Instead of making redundancies, he proposed that employers share out the remaining jobs on a rotating work schedule. Workers would alternate between extended periods in traditional industrial work and similar periods pursuing ‘New Work’. The latter included local production to meet practical needs, but also the right of everyone to spend a significant amount of their time pursuing a personally meaningful project.Access Space: In Sheffield, England - another post-industrial city, similarly hit by unemployment in the early 1980s - the artist James Wallbank and friends set up what has become the UK’s longest-running free internet learning centre. As described by NESTA, ‘The centre brings together old computers and new open source software to create a radical, sustainable response to industrial decline and social dislocation.’ In conversation, Wallbank has emphasised to me the importance of the social and directional role of participation at Access Space: for those who have been long-term unemployed, the change in the shape of their lives on becoming a regular participant is often huge; by comparison, the change from being a regular participant to entering employment is relatively small. From my own observation, another key aspect of the Access Space model is the power of its insistence on self-referral: this means that participants are drawn from a range of social and economic backgrounds, rather than exclusively from a target group identified by its deprivation. This means that participation at the centre provides an alternative to - rather than a reinforcement of - a negative social identification.West Norwood Feast: In 2010-11, the agency I founded led a project to co-create a community-owned and -run street market in south London. This experience reaffirmed my sense of the power of what people can do when they come together to work on something that matters to them. In particular, talking to those involved, I was struck by how positively many of them experienced using their skills as part of the Feast, when compared to their experience in regular employment. Might it be that work that takes place outside of employment is more likely to be experienced as meaningful? And, if so, why? Several possible answers exist. The psychologist Edward Deci famously demonstrated that being paid for a task tends to decrease our intrinsic motivation, a phenomenon he explains in terms of the shift of the ‘locus of motivation’. Meanwhile, as I argued in ‘The Future We Deserve’, the logic of maximising productivity has made industrial-era employment an unprecedentedly anti-social form of work. More practically, though, are there ways we can build a better relationship between meaningful work and our ability to pay the rent?House concerts: The music industry has been through huge disruption since the 1990s, not least as a result of the rise of filesharing. The solo bass player Steve Lawson is an example of an independent musician who has spent his career developing new models for making a living and documenting the realities of this on his blog. He sells downloads of his albums on a pay-what-you-want basis and makes ‘house concert’ tours on which he plays in the front rooms of fans, many of whom have first met him online. Reading his accounts of this, two things are clear: first, that these models, drawing on the strengths of networked technologies, allow for a far more meaningful relationship with his audience than was possible in the music industry of the pre-Napster era; and, second, that house concerts also make touring economically viable for independent musicians in a way that was harder when playing traditional venues. Are there other areas in which socially-embedded grassroots economies can thrive where high-overhead conventional economies struggle? (For another take on the potential of low-overhead economic models, see Kevin Carson’s The Homebrew Industrial Revolution.)The Unmonastery: One of the projects to emerge from the first phase of Edgeryders was a proposal for something called an Unmonastery: ‘a creative refuge bound to host problem solvers and change makers, who together work to solve (g)local problems, in exchange for board and lodging.’ At present, this proposal is being developed by a group that met through the Living on the Edge events in 2012. The initial response suggests that young people are willing to take a step down in their material expectations, if this is balanced by sufficient security and autonomy to pursue work which they believe matters. The challenge will be to develop a vehicle for this willingness which is capable of ‘interfacing’ with existing institutions and accessing resources, which can achieve a reasonable degree of stability, and which does not devolve into a mechanism for exploitation. Daunting as this sounds, it is likely that we will see more experiments along these lines in Europe in the years ahead. (Edventure: Frome, which launched in October 2012, has parallels to the Unmonastery model, although framed in educational terms.)Five years into the current crisis, the default future for much of Europe is a world of longer hours and lower wages. Economic regeneration as we have known it could hardly keep up with the social costs of industrial decline, even during periods of sustained growth. That economic collapse can lead into and become entrenched by a collapse of meaning is not just a post-Soviet story, but one that can be traced in many of Europe's former industrial regions, not least the areas of South Yorkshire where I once worked as a journalist.The scale and harshness of those realities makes me hesitate: I do not want to overstate the case for the examples I have discussed here. Yet I would suggest that they may offer clues, at least, towards another kind of regeneration: what might be called a ‘regeneration of meaning’. There is no guarantee that this will happen, nor that, if it does, it will take the kind of form we would wish to see. However, for those who consider the possibility worth exploring, I have a few questions:What would it take for this to coalesce into something serious?How far along is it already? (Is it further than we/others assume, due to its illegibility?)Where are the other examples that would build the case?What are the dangers? (For example, could the Unmonastery inadvertently become the workhouse of the 21st century?) Image credit: Listening to the Walls - Photo by Bembo Davies, Institute of non-toxic propaganda
Four years ago, as we were planning our move to Brussels, Nadia and I decided to look for flatmates. Most of our friends and family members were rather puzzled: not many couples decide to share their apartment, though they can afford not to. We, however, thought it completely logical. Nadia is Swedish and I am Italian: at the time we lived in Strasbourg, France. That made us a migrant nuclear family, completely cut off from the network of emotional and material support that our friends and families of origin could offer. We were simply too isolated in our Strasbourg apartment, nice though it was; and we decided to try something different. So, we rented a much bigger apartment than we needed and asked the Internet for someone to share it with.Four years on, we think the experiment worked. For the last three years we have been living with Kasia and Pierre, a young couple of expatriates (Kasia is Polish, Pierre French). We really enjoy the co-habitation: the home feels more animated, and not a day goes by that we don't chat at least a little bit, over coffee or breakfast. We enjoy the big, airy living room overlooking the city. And, frankly, we appreciate that our lifestyle is really good value for money: thanks to the economies of scale implicit in family life, we pay a reasonable rent for a really nice space.Along the way, we discovered that what makes our living together so enjoyable is that we are so different from each other. We come from four different countries; we are of different ages (Pierre, the youngest, is 19 years younger than me, the oldest); we have very different jobs (Kasia is a dental nurse, Pierre is the manager of a fashion boutique, whereas Nadia and I both belong to the "what is it that you do, again?" tribe); Nadia and I travel a lot, whereas Kasia and Pierre tend to be in town most of the time.This works well on many levels. On a purely practical level, when we travel we love the thought that the home is not empty, and in the event of some misfortune (think plumbing failure) they can intervene; and I am sure they enjoy the privacy and the extra space. We pay for electricity, phone and the Internet, they pay for the cleaning services – less paperwork to do. We have an extra room, which normally serves as Nadia's and my office; but it doubles up as a guest room for the guests of all of us.But there is more to co-habitation than practicality. Kasia and Pierre are lovely people: and, crucially, they are different people from Nadia and myself. We live out the city in different ways. We have different takes on almost everything, from French politics to Belgian beer. Comparing notes with them is always interesting, and I really value their insights and wisdom. Not that we spend all that much time together. I think our co-habitation unfolded in the right sequence: we started by a default attitude of rigorous mutual respect of each other's privacy and spaces. Then, over time, we grew closer, started to share the occasional meal, the occasional outing; we met each other's friends and families, lovely people to the last one. Guess what: we have built a sort of familial-like arrangement in a foreign city, among people who were originally complete strangers to one another.It's working well. So well that, when a year ago our landlord announced that he was reclaiming his apartment and we would have to move out in the summer, we decided to stay together, and to look for a new place as a four-people household. Eventually, we got more ambitious and thought, what the hell, we might as well grow the family. If four people can live so well together in a larger apartment, how would it work with five, or six, or seven in an even larger one?It works well, it turns out. We moved to a lovely loft, and were joined by a third couple (Belgian-Italian). Giovanni and Ilaria have since moved on for family reasons, but we enjoyed their company while we lived together. Their place has been claimed by Thomas, a young French engineer. We do this for totally egoistic reasons: we enjoy each other's company, we save money, we live in style. At the same time, we are aware that we are working our way through solving a global problem. Planet Earth has 230 million international migrants; intra-EU migrants like us are 8 million. Many of Europe's young people simply cannot afford to hold their ground: their work, education paths, and love lives lead them to migrate. When they do, they, like us, lose their supporting networks, and it is really hard to rebuild them. Living together, especially in diversity – the older with the younger, the sporty with the mobility-challenged, the academic with the blue-collar worker – becomes a platform for sharing our different abilities, and being able, as a household, to solve many different problems, both emotional and practical.None of this is new. You have heard it all before – at social innovation conferences and workshops, for example, and typically by people who live in middle-class nuclear families. But we have decided to walk this particular talk; it will probably not be the right choice for everyone, but it is the right choice Nadia, Kasia, Pierre and myself; and I strongly believe it might be right for many others. I encourage you to at least consider it for yourself: as more of us make this choice, the real estate market will respond, giving us more spaces suited to our particular lifestyle (in Brussels, for example, is very difficult to find large apartments with 3 or more bathrooms!). So, who wants to join?
Every week Edgeryders hosts a group video conference call to welcome new people in the Op3nCare community, as well as get up to speed with what is going on and where help is needed.Participating in these calls is a good way to really understand how the project works, and how you can get involved as they are where weCoordinate the upcoming activities as defined/required by the OpenCare research project partnersDiscuss topics and issues that need shared thinking and in some cases, shared decision making Welcome people from the broader community who wish to get involved in some wayWe document the sessions and post them online in weekly blogposts about what is going on, and where people can jump in to help each other.The call takes place at 16:30 CET in the google hangout: https://hangouts.google.com/call/xynru45ofvf27apnej2n3fjjlaeNb: While we prefer Open Source/ Free software, we have not yet found a viable alternative for these calls to google hangouts. If you know of a debugged, stable alternative that you have tested yourself please feel free to let us know about it.

@Costantino and me are here in Shenzhen at Tsinghua University, invited  to partecipate to  the sixth in a series of Sage Bionetworks’ events on open innovation. (read more here http://shenzhenassembly.org/ )The title is Know thyself and our world in the digital era and focuses  on the increasing knowledge through personal sensors, and how this form of open learning in a digital era can be applied to an area of shared concern – the environment.  the meeting will focus on the ubiquity of and the knowledge to be gained from personal sensors, and how this information can be applied to address issues of real concern.  the 3-day meeting is part conference and part hands-on. We're in the Innovation in open science project team and we'll:"Explore hacker/maker space projects in digital health and the environment.  Imagine a gathering where we will tackle the theme of the Assembly by making something together in a state-of-the-art maker space.  Luping Xu and Francois Grey, with the help of esteemed leaders in the maker world such as David Li and Eric Pan, will guide participants in a brainstorming session to build software or make objects in a space with equipment such as 3-D printers, sewing machines with conductive thread, microcontrollers, sensors, the works! "The team will be lead by Luping Xu and Francois Grey (active in open hardware community at cyberlab - read more here  http://cds.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2016/11/News%20Articles/2137964?ln=en ) , and will actively engage with the maker spaces in Shenzhen.More after the event.In the meanwhile some bits about Sage Bionetworks and also the reason why we accepted invitationa and we'll talk about Opencare:Inspired by open-source software models, Sage Bionetworks co-founder Stephen Friend builds tools that facilitate research sharing on a massive and revolutionary scale: https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_friend_the_hunt_for_unexpected_genetic_heroesJohn Willibanks of Sage Bionetworks about medical data https://www.ted.com/talks/john_wilbanks_let_s_pool_our_medical_data?language=en 
Local staff of opencare (Comune di Milano and WeMake) meets some parents of boys and girls with different abilities. The presentation will take place @ WeMake (Via Stefanardo da Vimercate 27/5 in Milan - MM1 Gorla) on 30 march 2016. h. 4.00 pm
An event run by the Institute of Tropical Medicine (www.itg.be), Nationalestraat 155, 2000 Antwerpen, BelgiumIt was meant to last two days, but has been cut short due to attacks in Brussels. The topic of the seminar is Health 2.0: Are we ready to go digital?Will participate and then share my notes here.
The purpose of this document is to help OpenCare project team and community members learn and master basic practices to help build a global network around the project. We outline core processes and tools deployed via http://edgeryders.eu and encourage anyone to step up and use these resources.Table of ContentsMain OpenCare communication channelsWorkspace: how to navigateCommunity space: how to onboard partners, collaborators, membersChallenges and stories: the main collective intelligence vehicle Submitting stories Euro Engligh as language Right to privacy and anonymity Research dataOther online engagement tools and practices Meetups Hangouts Working Out Loud Mailing lists Social mediaShared documentationDisclaimerLicense Main OpenCare communication channelsWe maintain two separate but linked spaces on the web:A Research Workspace: edgeryders.eu/opencare-researchdisplays basic information about Open Care as an EU funded project;contains all team communication threaded discussionsinteractive, live feed of the projectdesigned in the spirit of openness (anyone can come in and share content) and "working out loud" (format which the team is committed to)A Community space: opencare.ccfor community members, old and new people or anyone wishing to understand more about how to participate in the projecthighly curated information about the projectdesigned to explain to the broader community what opportunities the project providesredirects visitors to a space on edgeryders.eu and is also easily accesible from the main menu of the website (see it on the upper left side)Workspace: how to navigate itA proposed routine for quickly finding relevant info by project partners:Check your email notifications from contact@edgeryders.eu. If something needs your immediate attention, you were probably mentioned in a comment or were assigned a task by the team. The email title will signal this.On the platform, start from the workspace. Filter content by clicking on "Posts", "Wikis", "Tasks" etc. so you only see those.A proposed routine for making sure others see your content:Use the platform mentions in your texts - "@username" (start typing and it should autocomplete. The autocomplete choices show up in red below the edit window). Mentions send an email notification to the person being mentioned, making sure she sees your content. To make it easier to find content in the working group, consider naming your new posts using the following structure (it makes it easier to find content by using the search form on Edgeryders):[tag: Meta | Comms | Logistics | Events | Consortium | Reporting | Urgent etc] + title of the postCommunity space: how to onboard partners, collaborators, membersThe simplest way is to point people to the Community site.If someone learns about the project and lands on Edgeryders, there are several ways in, described in the How To Participate page: they can sign up on our mailing list, create a user account on the platform and follow or produce content to become involved. For people who prefer voice interaction, we have Meetups and a weekly Community Call through VOIP. All these are listed on the Meetups page. All people who are signed up on edgeryders.eu become community members and agree to the Edgeryders official user, privacy and content licensing policy, made visible to them upon signup. Members can post on the website, a point at which they are officially welcomed by community managers. @Noemi is primarily in charge of welcoming most users as they sign up and answer any questions they might have about using the space or different projects. OpenCare is building its own consent funnel for participation. This is being developed by ScImpulse.If you want to learn about Edgeryders community management practices, would like to share the work or become a community manager yourself join us here.However, most Open Care project partners are someone's contact point for the project i.e. when we speak about OpenCare in public presentations, events, open consortium meetings, or when simply sharing information online. Open Care will be different things to different people - it will be general i.e. a way to come together around new care systems; or specific i.e. research looking into dementia and supporting the carers. And so on. It's your own responsibility to gauge potential interest from someone and point them to relevant information.If there isn't relevant information available online, don't wait for others to do it! Go ahead and set up a post proposing a copy to be added to the Community base and edgeryders.eu admins will do it. Challenges and stories: the main collective intelligence vehicleAs we are spread all over the world, we meet and interact with Open Care community members here online, more than in any other settings. Publishing posts, reading each other and leaving comments to one another's contributions is how most of the interaction happens. Content in OpenCare in shared in response to challenges. Challenges are assignments: we describe a problem (for example: what is your experience of giving and receiving care?) and ask the community to respond. Good practice that you can adopt as much and as often as possible:Check the current Challenges and responsesSubmit your storiesLeave thoughtful comments to other people's storiesSubmitting storiesOnly users who have created an account on Edgeryders and are logged in with their username and password can submit stories.When submitting a story, the user is taken through a number of steps in order to clarify which challenge the story is answering, what personal question is the person trying to figure out, who would be an audience that they prefer, and what general topics they want to file the story under. The editing interface makes it possible to input text, links, to upload images or to embed video or audio files (using the HTML source).When users create a new piece of content, the other community members who have contributed previously in OpenCare will receive an email notification. Same is true when someone comments other stories.Euro English as language For a project with such a strong social networking element, it is absolutely essential that people can interact without mediation nor delay: having someone translate everything we post would be not only impossibly expensive: it would dampen interaction and feedback, making the Open experience quite miserable. To get around this problem, we have agreed to encode some rules in the social bargain of Open Care.These are:you are welcome to write in your own language. People can always get the gist of what you are writing by running it through Google Translate; however, we encourage you to write in Euro English, the lingua franca the majority of young Europeans use when they move about. I wrote Euro English, and I specifically don't mean the Queen's English: the former is an inclusive, connecting language that most youth speak enough to communicate, the latter is just another language, with its own solid grammar, pronunciation niceties and idiosyncrasies. There are many more people that speak Euro English, than people who speak the Queen's English.Community members agree to be tolerant of each other's grammar or spelling mistakes. No one is allowed to look down at anyone else for this. We are not stupid or under-educated, we are just writing in a foreign language. Our effort to communicate deserves respect.Community members who are native speakers of English are kindly requested to keep in mind they are part of a global community, and make their own effort to write in a simple, clear manner. Right to privacy and anonymity Given the sensitivity of a topic like care, we are encouraging members to feel confortable writing online, but we are aware that this may not be the case for everyone. All our team members are aware of this setback and make it possible for people to submit materials or write their personal stories in two ways: 1) creating a user profile which is not linked in any way to their real identity and uploading content from that account or 2) emailing stories and have one of the Open Care curators upload for them.Research data All written content submitted in the OpenCare online spaces will be aggregated, coded and analysed by researchers and in agreement with our Data Strategy. For details about the Open Care research, see our original proposal available here (pp.18-19).Other Online engagement tools and practicesMeetupsMeetups are offline or offline activities and events where community gets together. OpenCare partners and members are encouraged to run OpenCare activities and announce them as Meetups on the Community Space. They can be as small as a presentation at an conference, or a community Meet and Greet. Partners are already receiving invitations to tell about OpenCare in conferences, university lectures, hackathons etc. Our criterion for accepting or rejecting these invitations is their potential for engagement. We do not recommend accepting last-minute invitations: allow a minimum of two weeks lead time. This way, all of us involved can spread the news that someone in our team is going to be presenting in venue X on day Y, and reach out to others who might join you. Please post all your intended activities (online/offline, public meetings, conferences etc) as events in the Community space:   1. Click here. 2. Enter the information you have prepared for your session. Make sure you also include an image to act as a logo, it will make your event look better on the page.

The event will be listed on the Op3nCare Meetups page.Now the next step is to build interest and discussion around your event, email and share the link in your own networks. Use #op3ncare so we can help spread it through the Op3nCare social media accounts.HangoutsHangouts are weekly, online and open events where anyone can join.As of April 2016, hangouts happen every Monday at 4:30 PM CET. We are still looking for that perfect open source videoconferencing solution, so check the Events page and follow the instructions there.Also known as Op3nCare community calls, they serve two purposes at the same time: team coordination and welcoming new people. If you're attending the next, make sure to set the agenda by leaving comments to them. Every weeks call will be listed on the Op3n Meetups page. If you would like a call exceptionally scheduled, feel free to propose it, write, upload it, and run it (see Communicating your events above).If you are running an activity in Open Care that needs a separate community event, feel free to propose it, write it, and run it (see Meetups section above). Working out loudThe OpenCare research team is committed to publishing regular public posts to help community members keep track of what is going on and be able to plug in at any time. Posts in the OpenCare workgroup marked as such in their title (e.g. [Working out loud] Name of post). They are summaries of what needs your attention every 2 weeks, feeding in and out of the community calls. Written by @Noemi and other community managers (an example here).Mailing listsAn OpenCare list of supporters and interested people is growing. We send curated content collaborated by community to the list members no more than once a month. Sign up here.If you want to include something in it, get in touch with Noemi.Social media channelsCommunication in Open Care is not centralized, it is distributed among all consortium partners, so we are using the channels collectively. To get access to the login info, get in touch with Nadia. Open Care on facebook @op3ncare on twitterPinterest board (by Costantino)Newsletter updates (sent no more than once a month)Mailinglist to share social updates (sent on a tighter regular basis)Hashtags: #op3ncare #opencare  Shared project identity visuals, cover photos, thumbnail, partners logos etc are listed publicly here. Feel free to use, modify, re-purpose them as you wish (see License below).Shared documentationA live repository of project updates is the workspace:OpenCare Research. A repository of project documentation (including Consortium Agreement), copy, materials, photos, cover pages and other miscellaneous is located in the OpenCare shared google drive (for Consortium Partners).

Every week Edgeryders hosts a group video conference call to welcome new people in the Op3nCare community, as well as get up to speed with what is going on and where help is needed. Today's call takes place here: https://hangouts.google.com/call/wqqa4tjk6bbyzeuaxr4fss6ziaeWe document the sessions and post them online in weekly blogposts about what is going on, and where people can jump in to help each other. What we discussed last week: How do we navigate the tension between asking for permission and asking for forgiveness? If you want to bring something up at the next group conference call, just post a comment here before the event to give us time to coordinate a bit.See you on Tuesday at 16.30 CET!
After discussing with colleagues and community members in Edgeryders, I propose we “zoom in” from care in general to three specific instances. This will make the discussion more concrete and more relevant to the people out there whom we wish to connect and work with. The price we pay is that we might discourage people with interesting cases that do not fall into this taxonomy (eg. Helliniko). We suggest: Social and or health care of refugees in Europe (Challenge brief here) Prevention of Suicide in the hacker community (Challenge brief here) Helping both caregivers and care receivers in dealing with dementia (Challenge brief here)  They are a good match for OpenCare, because: They involve people in vulnerable situations where dynamics in community connections, or lack of, play a significant role. Can Guy/Alberto's network science perspective help us to make visible and understand these social flows?  They involve some interaction with the formal health and social care system, conditions as well as norms/behaviors in society at large. Can Erik and Tino's approach help us make sense of this and translating it into institutionally comprehensible language?  They involve and require a deep understanding of healing and medical practice, especially the ethical considerations for both caregivers and care recipients. Can Marco, Massimo's and other's work in the field and in the lab help us to identify and understand how to deal with these issues? In the research as well as in the intiatives themselves?  The city as a place and institutions is where all of these interactions and relationships live (or do not). Can Lucia and Rossana and others in the city of Milano help us understand how a city can make visible and enable promising approaches and nurturing the people who drive them?  Can we design interventions offer workarounds to the obstacles these intiatives, and the indivuals they attempt to support (caregivers and care recipients)? What forms could these interventions take in order to unlock more care in the different situations (artefacts, communication, services, processes, upskilling, administrative and legal hacks, policy changes and or something else? Here I think the ingenuity and very particular skillset of Costantino, Zoe and others in the weMake constellation could make a very important contribution.  Please validate them or counterpropose others. We need to move on. 
The first free hands-on workshop of the #opencare series will take place this next Friday 18 March in Milan at ‘Fa la cosa giusta’. Come and learn how to create an #IoT #opensource service to monitor and take care of your loved ones remotely.here in italian: http://wemake.cc/2016/03/15/opencare-a-fa-la-cosa-giusta/if you have the possibility to come drop us a line: hello [at] wemake.ccwith @alessandro contini @Cristina_Martellosio @Rossana Torri @Costantino @Silvia_D'Ambrosio @ChiaraFrr
https://securitybrief.com.au/story/information-security-professionals-may-not-be-prepared-iot-after-all/As you might expect, the IoT is fraught with security holes and a growing population of users who are rather unconcerned about it - mainly because they don't know and don't think about it enough.  But do you want someone hacking into your Google Car?  This article points out that many IoT devices and projects don't even know all that connect to them.
Tomorrow the second meeting with the Milanese community will take place. Comune di Milano and WeMake, in collaboration with the association "Villa Pallavicini" have organized a presentation of OpenCare to engage a local migrant community.  Thursday 17 march - 7.30 pmVilla PallaviciniVia Meucci 3 Milano
During today's call  @johncoate , @Natalia Skoczylas , @phm and I had the first real project co-design session. A summary of what was discussed [please add what I have missed]:We discussed three cases:  The Diabetes implant: What was an illegal hack in 2012, is now a solution that is available for others. How did this happen? What kind of legal hoops did they have to jump through?    Im many EU countries the welfare infrastructure was designed for populations with planned groth. With more refugees arriving you both have an increase in number of people to care for, and different kinds of needs which is being framed as the source of " chaos in the system". Perhaps it would make sense to look at how health- and social care is being managed both in the camps and temporary receoption centres, as well as in the mainstream healthcare providers.     Is there a distincting between the NHS overall (long term) and the temporary refugee situation:  Is it just a question of money, or are/were there some things that can be improved? How does a clinic in Brixton cope with a situation in which you have five hundred people who have just walked to Calais and have broken feet? In addition to the Epidemological situation.     We need raw data about how the healthcare situation is currently being managed, but from first hand sources...ie go out and ask people on the ground. How many doctors, nurses and others are currently active in caring for the new arrivals? Where are the resources coming from, is it mainly charities? Is this information already out there and is anyone aggregating information about the different intiatives providing care services to people?  Some early "conclusions":When it comes to DIY solutions to health- and social care problems, there is a key tension between asking for permission and asking for forgiveness. Who/how can and should we convene around finding legal/administrative hacks for existing DIY solutions to health- and social care problems? An obvious path towards achieiving impact is to find, acknowledge and draw support towards people who already are doing important work. This has to happen online on the edgeryders.eu platform in order for us to fullfull our obligations and to stay true to our mission. Does it make sense to run the project in 3-month cycles consisting of the following steps?  People reach out to little known but promising initiatives and ask them about their work and post the documentation on platform where we can help edit them into really compelling stories. These stories are designed as informative case studies with a specific call for action from the broader community.    We share their stories online and engage the internet in making sense of the challenges they face, as well as identifying fixes/hacks/solutions/new projects. Part of this is sharing specifications, doing requirements engineering and the necessary background research to determine viability of different proposals.    We build a number of small, focused events in which people existing intiatives with designing and build the identified fixes/hacks/solutions and projects. Kind of like the workshop on Collaborative Inclusion...but taking place over a couple of days, in a hacker or makerspace, where you leave having built something that works.

http://www.rferl.org/content/lesbos-migrants-turning-boats-into-backpacks-dutch-volunteers/27587663.htmlis a link to a story about a Dutch woman who made a super clever hack of the junk boat and lifejacket parts to make backpacks out of them using a few simple tools, which she then taught to the refugees.  An excellent maker story solving a real problem without having to get too high tech or even ask for wither permission or forgiveness..
http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/10/frontline-doctorsIs a link to a writeup on an hourlong BBC documentary I watched while I was in Amsterdam last week.  I didn't see a link to watch it online, though the synopsis is very good.  It would be interesting to follow up with those doctors to see what they are doing about all this now.
[Moving forward with WP5 Tasks 5.2]http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet_viz/tweet_app/We have mentioned it would be interesting to provide sentiment analysis feedback to those who would monitor conversations taking place on the forum.I am interested in finding an appropriate sentiment landscape, I thought the experiment by C. Healy would be worth trying. You enter words, the app scrapes twitter for you and then displays a cloudpoint (points correspond to tweets). Go play!I am also interested in your feedback about the utility of such a viz. How would you intuitively use such a represntation? Just look at it? Drive the navigation between posts (here tweets) from that viz? Query the posts and get back to the authors' neighborhood (in the crowd of all authors)? Etc.
Hi everybody,Next Saturday the first meeting with the Milanese community will take place. Comune di Milano and WeMake, in collaboration with the association "Mare Urbano Milano" have organized a "liscio" dancing afternoon to present the project to a vivacious community of elderly dancers. more update soon...   Alberto
Hi all,we are excited and preparing last things for the press conference taking place on the 9th of March at 11am at Palazzo Marino (Milan's major palace) with Comune di Milano team and WeMake team. After the event we're going to share a report here on Edgeryders.bestZoe
Every week Edgeryders hosts a group video conference call to welcome new people in the Op3nCare community, as well as get up to speed with what is going on and where help is needed. We document the sessions and post them online in weekly blogposts about what is going on, and where people can jump in to help each other.Before we decide on the exact place we need to find the right software. Ideally it should be open source, and allow several people to video chat at the same time. What would be amazing is if it could be embedded here. I found a promising software called appear.in (you can test the room I set up for Op3nCare here), but it is not open source.If you want to bring something up at the next group conference call, just post a comment here before the event to give us time to coordinate a bit.See you on Tuesday at 16.30 CET!
Imported back from the hackpad: https://lote5.hackpad.com/FRI-1000-Collaborative-inclusion.-2THjEEYA7Iy. Thanks to all note takers.FRI 10:00 | Collaborative inclusion.How migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values. A reflexive design exercise.LOTE5 session: https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare/let-s-co-create-our-own-welfare-how-to-design-collaborativePlease read the Notes for participants prepared by Ezio and the team: http://bit.ly/1PMWB0VThis pad text is synchronized as you type, so that everyone viewing this page sees the same text.  This allows you to collaborate seamlessly on documents!Ezio: "Before you try to invent something new, look very attentively for existing solutions in society. Even as you find them, that does not mean you cannot help: these inventions will typically exist, but they will need help, they will be perfectible.Today we are going to do just this: We take an issue – migration and the influx of refugeesWe look around at what people are already doing in order to ameliorate the problem.We audit those services from a design point of view and we look at spaces for improvements.What makes a service "good"? In the area of design for social innovation we consider services "good" if:They run on the active participation of beneficiaries. They make use of the situated knowledge of everybody involved.They create value for the society at large.We look at two main value creation strategies: Improving the case. Enriching the case's ecosystem – imagine things around the project that give it positive externalities.We are really not qualified to improve the case of services designed and implemented by others. They know so much more than we do about those projects and how they really work.  Looking to enrich the ecosystem is much simpler. The main question is: what can I, with my peers, do to improve this?These services are targeted at inclusion. Why is it collaborative inclusion? Say we we repair a bicycle, and we do it together: when we have done it, we will not "simply" have a working bicycle: we will have a social relationship that can be repurposed to do things other than repairing that particular bicycle. Collaboration is an engine to build social capital, and social capital then produces a flow of new things. But collaboration is tricky: it requires an explicit social contract (what are you promising?) and commitment. Collaboration is also interlinked with the issue of diversity: having diversity is good, because it enhances the resilience of the system, but it also increases the costs of  collaboration. Yara Al Adib describes the process of arriving in Belgium as a refugee. A visual synthesis is here: https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/how-refugees-are-processed-in-belgium. It's pretty heartbreaking: hurry and wait; disempowering sense that there is this impersonal machine dragging you on. Some of the people in Belgium were very empathetic, but you do meet with a lot of stereotypes.The journey is interesting. You meet a lot of people, you learn things. It is also quite challenging, it puts in situations where you have to be brave. The casesElizabeth from DineWithUs (http://dinewithus.strikingly.com/). "Once a migrant has been processed and is "legalised" in Belgium there remains a wall between Belgians and newcomers. I was personally frustrated that I did not know any of them, and all my friends were white. Our idea is pretty simple, just share a meal, learn recipes and teach your own. We have now over 100 registrations, it's working OK but we need to grow."Sara from StudioRefugee (http://www.studiorefugee.be/).  "We match (graphic) designers (and design-students) with refugees to design products that contain real refugee-stories, then sell the products."Tarik from SmartSocial (http://www.smartsocial.be/). "I have a hospitality startup. What with refugee crisis, we asked ourselves whether we could use that expertise and team towards social housing. So we started a first project serving minors in the European contract. We have a very good relationship with FedAsil Our first obstacle: the owner of the building is not so happy that minor refugees will move into his building. So we tried to convert some of future co-working spaces from our other startup into temporary accommodation for refugees. But we were sued by our neighbours. But we won: we have legal expertise and took the case very seriously. This is a crazy venture, but it is important to address the crisis. I am grateful to my business partners who accepted that I dedicate half of my time to SmartSocial. As entrepreneurs, we know camps are not enough, and should get involved when we see the opportunity." The design tools (Vishall and Stefanos from Namahn)Stakeholder map. Who are the protagonists of this story? Which groups are affected, or interested? Migrants, for sure, but certainly other people too. Persona. "Placeholder" imaginary persons that we can imagine interacting with our cases. Journey of Experience. A conceptualization of how people interact with services over time. It forces us to think in terms of time. Plenary restitutionIn the StudioRefugee case, the area of improvement is how you create value for both refugees and the Belgian host community. The concept is that in addition to turning the venture into a cooperative with shared ownership from refugees, some of the refugees who get involved can become ambassadors for the StudioRefugee. They envision to expand from Ghent to Antwerp, putting one of the refugee-designers in charge. Rand suggestions enabling makers of artefacts, refugees themselves, to sell their own products e.g in Brussels Vintage Market.Some of the more detailed discussions: Selling products is a highly competitive market - > Need to offer customer value propositionAlso, where do you start?  This depends on intent: Is it training people to build skills?  Is it nurturing exceptional talents? or generating an income stream? If you start with the people: Find means to be able to train people to develop skills (information, education, financial support)If you start with the talent: Find people with unique skills, incubate themIf you start with customer: Find distribution channel, map demandThere is a discussion about this where some people in the group assert that the venture has to generate an income for the refugees, and not just training- training for what? Founder's answer: Making people happy!The DineWithUs group has recommended to advertise the service already from within the refugee camps, using the camps themselves as a communication device. Now people who register from small communities tend to have no match, so they sit idly. We have imagined we could instead ask first registrants from one community to become volunteers, putting themselves out as the reference point of DWU in their local community. Additionally:Public feedback: "we really had fun at our dinner..."Collaboration with chefs.Photographs of participants on the website (it fosters trust) "... many more, there is not the time to list them all!"[Missed the SmartSocial restitution, please add]. "Until you know the people you are nothing. The sooner you can attach refugees to a social network, the better."Is it better to have a generalist service that also refugees can use or should we have specialised, "exclusive" services? The refugees in the room (particularly Rand and Orwa) could not really decide one way or the other. They do not like labels, but they do appreciate how difficult it can be for refugees to use generalist services. Ezio: you should have both. Specialised services should "break the ice", but then generalist ones should be welcoming towards refugees. 
On February 28, we came together in Brussels for the first Narratives of Care Storytelling workshop.What started with a simple question which developed into deep conversations that are still ongoing days after everyone went home. Pauline kindly contributed her notes from the discussions and I uploaded them here. Also Ezio summarised his own reflections around care from a different, but related, discussion here.From the different conversations I draw the conclusion that a big part of building effective storytelling for our individual care-related initiatives is designing contexts for care that work for us. As care givers and receivers:How to do this effectively? Is it the same for regardless of which kind of initiative you are communicating around, or not? Are there significant cultural differences around care and communication that need to be taken into account or no?This brunch is an opportunity to research and prototype answers to these questions  together in a nice and relaxed environment with delicious things to eat!Bring yourself, your project and anyone you want to invite along. Just let me know a day in advance so I can plan for enough food :))

Talk to me excercise:the point of the excercise is that there are some implicit information about care. The group slit up in 3 people groupsone people ask question one people answer questionone people is documentingeach session is 20'  Workshop Notes (Contributed by Pauline) Going from the personal and going global to create  Common ground (everywhere) Connection → Empathy Providing care is providing empowerment for you and the other, helping build steps to autonomy.Create expectations?Responsibility? When does storytelling create empathy? What are the conditions? That it create a connexion to the other person’s circumstances.  Common experiences – if I have been through an experience, am I more equipped to support the other facing that experience?→ If I was a combatant, I can share my story first then be better equipped to support the combatant I work with. → Create a link through storytelling fro better care? The connexion depends on each particular case – dependency? There is a very personal experience.  It is very different when your web of personal experiences are involved. → The relationship to distance and care is not as simple; it may be easier to care for someone who is not personally involved. → Idea of proximity and whether it is helpful or not Idea of expectations from a particular context: only support certain things in certain circumstances. You only want to care about certain things at certain times so there is the question of:TimingContext when shared? Important concepts for care (therefore to include into storytelling practice): Communion Compassion Self-care Awareness Why you help and whether you are more helped yourself.  Burden of care should be spread among people.  Sharing care experiences.  What does this mean for narratives of care?  Create a context for storytelling. → Get to know each other + basic needs?→ Expectations→ Communication and identity/sculpture  Showcase the offer and manage expectations. But how?→ Communication around culture→ Storytelling could also be the basis on which you build the context for care.  Frame it as a tool for empowerment.  Shared intentions and part of context.What stories? Does the narrative approach scale as well as we think it does?→ Can you actually bring it global? Yes if you recognize the identity and scaling issue?  Availability heuristic Narrative pattern – ‘imagine a world where…. Oh yeah by the way it already exists…’ Carriers of narratives – Fiction of narratives, fables, archetypes or a story pattern (David and goliath, or the fool, the hero who goes on a quest). Look at propaganda in the LRA.→ Are there universal stories?→ But is it personalized better?→ Note on George Lucas mythologist  David Hume Conclusion:Space for care includes a variety of aspects that one should balance nut still take action. Intention Expectations Context-setting Storytelling as a tool not a universal answer Parties Passive, Active, ProactiveGive - Receive | Request - response = Communication space around care (actively caring)They are a lot of difficulties in communicating around care.Stories – legends - can be a tool to not directly address the issue but rely and build on universal stories.  What then would be 5 steps to design your context of care?→ Current future vs ideal future  
Imported from the hackpad: https://lote5.hackpad.com/SAT-0930-1045-MASTERS-OF-NETWORKS-NETWORKS-OF-CARE-hackathon-for-network-scientists-doctors-and-patien.... Thanks to all note takers, especially Rossella B.This is the main conversation https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/masters-of-network-4-networks-of-careYou can download Tulip from herehttp://tulip.labri.fr/TulipDrupal/You can download the data file here https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7HgdYQcOLwncWhwQ3lKdmZXMmM/viewThe data we have are about edgeryders users, which posts they posted and who reacted we want to see how they interact, so we want to link them to one anotherTulipIf you click on "user to post" in tulip, you see emphasized the users that have written the original post, and which posts they wrote, linked to that user.If you click on one of the posts you see information about the post, the text, the date, the title, plus some information that is internal to the software and is not so interesting for us.SemanticsEdgeryders supports in-platform etnographic tagging. Ethnography is a qualitative method to analyze texts and attach tags to the texts that represent what the text says. The tags have to be standardized, so different researchers can be consistent in the use. In the past ethnographic researches where limited because it was costly to gather the texts via interviews and transcripts. They are not statistically representative.Edgeryders supports in-platform etnographic tagging. Of course, most content in Edgeryders is NOT ethnographically tagged: ethnography is expensive, and we only do it as part of contracts in which ethnography is used to lift collective expert advice from the conversation.Online the texts are already written, so they don't need to be transcribed, and the ethnographers' codes can be kept together with the texts.These tags are composed of super-classes (f.i. "Topic" or "Place") and they can be nested, and for each super-class you can entry different values (f.i. "Charity" or "Cairo").An example: the users writes "Our task will be to explore how we may then model interaction beween users," -> the ethnographer attaches the tag "interaction" . This tag is added in the html code of the platform, directly linked to the original text.When this happens, a semantic layer is added to Edgeryders content.  We can add semantics to the social network representation of the Edgeryders conversation: not just "who is talking to whom", but, adding semantics, "who is talking to whom about what".Edgeryders dataOn Edgeryders, the ethnographic data are linked to other kind of data, like the profile of the users (age, location etc), the circumstances surrounding the text. We have these ethnographer-coded data only for a specific conversation (because we had financing to gather it). We want to do this again in Open Care.Of course you do not have all the information about the context of a conversation, for instance you don't know what happened besides the online platform. We will still miss a lot, and make misinterpretations.Question (Ezio Manzini): what is the object that you are observing? Is it a conversation on Open Care or is it a conversation on Open Care in the context of the Edgeryders platform, and such and such.A problem about "large scale conversations": a large number of users does not imply that many people will participate in the conversation. In the course of a EU project called CATALYST we learned that almost no threads have more than 10 participants, even in "large communities" like Loomio, with 10K users.We should rephrase the question says Ezio, one that is more precisely the question that can be answered by this tool. Yes, but we need to use the tool to discover the question. You have some questions and in the process you will discover more questions.NetworkWe have users who initiate posts and reply to posts with comments. We have ethnographers who will tag some of the texts. We want to discover how people interact and what the conversations will be about.When you click"user to user" in Tulip you actually see the people who interact (have a conversation). user to comments: which comments they made"post to groups" you see the posts that have been added in the group.user to tags tells you which users are talking about a tag - if you believe in collective intelligence you need more than this because you still don't know if these users are talking to each other -> you want to see the conversations between the users that contain this tag, that is when the semantic is importantwe also want to link concepts to other conceptsHere you an see if a tag was interesting and if it was important. When people share something or comment is a different thing. Relevance can become important as well. (This previous has to do with sentiment analysis) But it is not the core of what we want to do in Open Care. It can be important to single out the people who talk about a topic.idealistic idea of human interaction. Deep conversation, rather than big data.User-to-tags networks are not easy to interpret. Guy and Benjamin Renoust introduced semantic edges show me only the edges that include "real action" as tag. another idea is visualising two networks, one of people to people and one of tags to tags. if you 'lasso" a topic you sese the network of people who talked about it. if you lasso two topics you see the people who talked about either (but you can switch view and see who talked about both). if the people have been talking to each other about the tag then the edge becomes red as well, otherwise only the node. If you select a user you can see the tags he's been talking about.In this version of the network, people are connected if one of them reacts to the other's post of comment. If someone reacts to a comment to somebody's else's post, then he'll be connected to the author of the comment but not to the author of the post. It is possible with these data to make different choices. Start from a tag, say "open-source software" andsee if the people talking about it are also talking to each other. If so, we can speak of  an emergent group of specialists, emergent because it "happened", nobody assigned them to do that. The word "group" is critical here: if people were just speaking about open source software in isolation, they could be in total disagreement and not even know about it, but if they are talking to each other about open source software there can be a convergence going on, like when Wikipedians weed out mistakes in the encyclopedia's articles. lasso those guys and see what else they are also talking about, and get an indicative map of how this emergent group of experts sees the topic. The present data are "post-mortem" of the conversation. The ideal situation is to be able to analyze the conversation with this tool almost "real-time", let's say on a daily basis. This, however, has the problem that ethnographic research does not really work that way: ethnographers find it easier to maintain consistency if they work in batch. Guy: The tool could influence people to do more if it was available. It can be a user tool, besides a research tool. Alberto: However the Edgesense tool was made available to the community, and there do not seem to be that many people looking at it.Edgesensehttps://edgeryders.eu/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.htmlThe color coding are the nodes that are more connected to each other that to other members of the group. If you are very active you have "your own" group. For instance Noemi, her group is not exactly a star but very central.The links are directional: two nodes can be linked by two curved lines, one from node a to node b, the other in the opposite direction.You  can show by degree (number of connections), select only the edges that link to and from the moderators. You can also hide them and see that the network is still holding. Some people fall out, but the giant component remains.OpenCare narrativeThis example also helps clarify Ezio's question above. What is the question that this network representation can answer? The sociology of the network. It helps manage the group. The network we saw on Tulip, it might be worth spending some time to find a bridge between what the tool can do, and the general question "what is open care". IN which ways can it be helpful?This network is updated real-time. What would be a proper time frame for a semantic coding? The coding needs some consistency. So the ethnographer will say you make a conversation and then we tag it. The project on open care does not include a real-time semantic coding. That is a lot of work and would be a big addition to the project, needing its own financing.Keywords. Quality tracking. Network authoritativeness. You could use the latter to filter what the ethnographer has to code, so the method becomes scalable. Not by using robots (not working with ethnography) but because you use network math to filter the content.Author generated tags can work if implemented with auto-prompting and proper incentives, Harry Halpin has published on this about Delicious. Ethnography would not agree, Alberto believes., we can't trust it, although we can try it. But the added values is in small numbers, because then it can be used by smaller communities as well. Ezio: the tool also needs to help develop some intervention. For instance spotting the emergent group of experts could be a useful intervention for the Comune di Milano. We need to develop a narrative like that about the tool we saw in Tulip for Open Care. Alberto believes he has a narrative, a strong hypothesis. Collective intelligence. Small scale collective intelligence. Problems are local, resources are local. So if we have a permanent think-tank on a platform and a cheap way to harvest from it, then we have a tool for a local community to use. You can identify the emergent groups of experts on specific topics and look at them rather than having to make a large scale study. Instead of going up, going big I'm trying to go down, go deep, focus on a small group of people, without drawing a line around them (because then you'd loose the openness).Ezio: I've never posted. It would be different if someone would ask around if they have something to say. Now I am here and I talk to people, I feel committed. But now I understand that we have to write because if we talk now we cannot register what we say. Alberto: This is the open. You commit to make the things you said available to people you did never even meet.Ezio: we are collectively writing a document. You should know who the contributors are. At a certain point, you can say this is the book we wrote and these people wrote. The way this book was written has made it possible to work in a certain way. Alberto: yes, in the end, the ethnographic report will say we had these number of people and... Ezio: if I want to participate I have to write and I have to be very attentive. Alberto: you can also choose to be a marginal author, just have a role along the side. And you still are a coauthor. Also the cook who made the lunch at the Lote5 meeting mattered in the making of the book.Ezio: co-design process. These tools could be part of the solution. We are now a network and there could then be a network of nurses doctors etc. This discussion can in a similar way happen among care-givers? Costantino: the conversation will not be the result of this group, but of a larger group. But the network of care-givers might be not committed, skilled, or motivated to use an online tool. As an example it is possible to use the results of the ethnographic study to feed the discussion at the Comune di Milano. Alberto: Ideally you bridge across. Costantino: this is the hard part. If the discussion is not well documented and published in the coming days, then the online community will miss it. And viceversa. So the tricky part is right here. How can we bring them across each other. In terms of artifact, in terms of codesign, our committment is to at least make transparent what are the needs of the people that we are meeting, how are the codesign sessions organised. Upload the design of a artifact online so that other people can contribute. Many levels: design, conversation... We are going far beyojnd ER as it was right now. We are not only creating a book or a report we are also committed to create real prototypes. So we need to go one step forward, so that we have the tools to manage not only the online conversation but also the other levels. But the online conversation is key to all this.Alberto: we are not trying to invent a new methodology, just trying to do it well. The online community is key because of permanency, findability, linkability...A discussion about Wikipedia, the major difficulty is that we do not own that platform so we can't control. I'm in a village and need info, i go to wikipedia, and ER might use that. You can't brief too much in terms of what will emerge in terms of design. People in Milano have clear problems: Where do I leave my kids. You try to solve, and the solutions kind of work and we try to use this process to make it better.The process that we are following here is not the prototype. The prototype we talk about is some care solution. Online the local problem in Milano goes global and someone from France can intervene in the conversation. The prototyping part is in Milan, but care issues are similar all over the world. In the Spot the Future project we saw the the international interaction was very valuable. The capability of transferring the knowledge by solutions found abroad to other context is exactly the point that makes it possible to finding new solutions.Afternoon sessionTwo groups: quality of data and Wikipedia dataQuality of data sessionWe used Tulip and Detangler to explore a semantic network dataset similar to the one that will be used for Open Care. We filter our data according to two proxies for quality:post/comment length as quality: discard all posts and comments under, say, 100 characters. This would only keep thoughtful contribution. user pagerank as quality: pagerank or other eigenvector centrality measures are often associated to correlate to authoritativeness. So, we can reduce the network to the contributions made by the highest-ranking individuals. The hypothesis is that the reduced semantic social networks would not be much different from the non-reduced ones. If that is confirmed, the methodology is scalable: if you get a ton of content, just filter it for quality, and work only on the top-quality 15%. We walked through the exercise and found that our reducing code works. However, we found inconsistencies in the data (many comments and posts with apparently no text – though, when we checked them on the Edgeryders platform, of course the text was there!). We do not feel confident to draw any conclusion. The group resolved to redo the exercise starting from a fresh extraction. Guy Melançon is taking the lead for this. Wikipedia sessionWe made a sketch of a graphic representation of the medical articles on wikipedia in all languages. The larger the node, the more often a page has been visited and links represent the hyperlinks between pages. We use this representation to explore the data and look at emerging patterns. For instance we will compare the structure of the networks in the different language to see if there might be cultural or geographical properties that can lead to interesting research questions.The code for the Wikipedia session can be found here: https://github.com/spaghetti-open-data/visualizing-self-diagnosis
Friday Oct 21, 2016 - Sun Oct 23, 2016http://hackinghealth.ca/event/hh-bordeaux-hackathon/Adeline came accross this event to be organized in Bordeaux bext fall. The organization behind it is AquitHealth -- I have contacted them as I saw a past student of mine is part of the founders. I should soon meet with them.I then wondered how useful it would be to be present at this event (we in Bordeauw will be, but how about others from OpenCare?).The event apparently is partly organized around hacking sessions (interesting for people at WeMake?). I'll post an update as I get to better understand what they are doing and what the event is about.
PremiseIn my understanding, in the first round of the Open Care discussion both the terms “care” and “open” have been used referring to different meanings. This premise is my personal attempt to map these different uses.CareCare referred to a special kind of human interaction: someone (the care giver) gives attention to, and takes action for, someone else (the care receiver). Care referred to a set of artifacts: the products and services of the system which, in a given time and place, enables the care activities (i.e. the care interaction of the point 1). OpenA.  Open referred to the care system: a system is open when different actors have the possibility to play a role. This can happen when the whole activity package is opened and divided into parts with the possibility, for these different parts, to be distributed among different actors.  B. Open referred to the information flow: a system is open when the information on which it is based are open. This can happen when these information are totally visible, accessible and transferable to other systems.Open CareConsidering the different meanings of “care” and “open”, in my view, there is a clear correlation between 1 and A, and between 2 and B:A1 Open care refers to the final result. That is, it refers to the characteristics of the care system we intend to create: a care system where different actors (experts and non experts) are in condition to play a relevant role. B2 Open care refers to the design/production process. That is, it refers to the characteristics of a co-design and co-production process: the process leading to the realization of the products and services on which an aimed care system is based. Our discussion…For what I have understood until now the general motivation for the research (see the Open Care research introduction) seems to mainly refer to A1, where the consortium profiles and experiences are mostly linked to the B2. In my view, at this stage of the Open Care research we should take a clear decision: do we want to deal with A1, with B2 or with both, A1+B2. If the choice is for A1+B2, we should clearly define when, where and how we will discuss of A1 and when, where and how of B2. NB: The following Notes mainly refer to open care assuming the A1 meaning. CareSince the beginning of human history, care has been exchanged (given and received) inside homogeneous, durable and relatively closed groups of individuals: families, clans, village communities, urban neighborhoods ... In the past century, in parallel to that, care has been delivered also by dedicated institutions: hospital, kindergartens, elderly residences...  Today, for several reasons, the demand of care is growing and becoming more complex, while both the traditional and the modern offer of care are less and less capable to cope with it. In fact, in the present fluid, hyper individualized societies, families, village communities and urban neighborhoods are weakening (if not totally disappearing) and individuals, given their life structure, have less and less practical possibilities to take care of others (even when, in principle, they would do it). In turn, care institutions, which were supposed to substitute the traditional community’s and individual’s care, have less and less economic resources (and often political will) to do it. The gap between the growing demand and the shrinking offer of care is the basis of the present care crisis: a lack of care that is not only practical (the caring system do not succeed in coping with the care demand), but also psychological (the sense of loneliness deriving by the lack of sense of care throughout the whole society). To overcome this crisis a brand new care systems has to be imagined and enhanced. To move in this direction, a first step is to better understand caring activities, considering their nature and diversity. The practical/organizational side of care is particularly important because care is not only exchanging information and knowledge. Care asks also for proximity and action: doing something for each other, taking time and being committed.Care activities. Care activities are quite diverse: they can be performed by whoever could be willing to do it (as to make the shopping for somebody who is momentary sick); they can require a lot of time, attention and assumption of responsibility (as to take care of the daily life necessities of somebody seriously ill); they can require timely actions by highly specialized experts (as surgery interventions in very specific moments). And so on.   In general terms, these differences are characterized by a set of main parameters, as: Time: duration, frequency, flexibility, …Space: virtual, hybrid, only physical, …Competences: normal everyday life socialization, specific diffuse knowledge, specialized expert knowledge, …Responsibility: very low; low, high, very high.Different care actions should be attentively analyzed and mapped using this kind of parameters. Nevertheless, intuitively, we can already say that different care activities could be delivered by different actors in different modalities. It comes that, to imagine a new care system, we should, first of all, recognize all the potential care givers, considering them as resources: effective care resource (when they are already active) and potential care resources (when they could be activated if some conditions would be given)Care resources. In principle, everybody can care for someone else. He/she can do it in different forms (depending on his/her expertise and time availability), but all of them require attention. In turn, given that attention is a limited resource (each person has a limit in his/hers capability to give attention), this is true also for his/her capability to care. In other word, care (both the expert and non-expert one) is a diffuse but limited resource. Presently, care systems are built on a mix of three main resources:Institutional care givers (based on professional actors)Third sector and charity organizations (based on both professional and non professional actors)Traditional care communities (as families, village communities, urban neighborhoods).We know that, for different reasons, all of them are in difficulty to cope with the growing care demand. Therefore, the issue is to reshape the system in order to permit to some new potential resources to emerge and become effective resources. Mainstream and contra trends. We have said that, in principle, everybody, depending on his/her time and expertise, could give some forms of care. But we can observe that today, in the contemporary societies, this care potential, clashes with the dominant culture and practice: a cultural attitude that, in the name of individual freedom and convenience, tends to assume a careless approach to everything and everyone (the throwaway society extended from things to human relationships). And: a mainstream practice of living that makes difficult to introduce care activities in the daily life (due to work constrains, to the evolution of families and to their being scattered in different places). Therefore, given the present structures of family and work, few people can commit to offering care, especially if this requires continuity, high responsibility and duration in time.Nevertheless, several examples tell us that there still are several people who could and would dedicate some time/energy/attention to well defined caring activities - if and when an appropriate enabling system would permit them to do it in a easy and flexible way. This limited but diffuse caring availability is the potential resource that the socio-technical innovation should be capable to transform in an effective resource.  In other words, thanks to an appropriate socio-technical innovation, it should become possible to cultivate and harvest the limited individual caring resources of broader groups of subjects. That is, to catalyze and coordinate existing but not used care resources could be the key to overcome the care crisis of contemporary societies.Hypothesis and visionHypothesis. If the close (social or institutional) organizations of the past cannot cope with the dimension and complexity of the present demand of care, they must be opened. That is: the care activities must be divided in smaller/lighter tasks, and allocated to a large number of actors, each one giving what he/she is capable/willing to give. Vision. Open care is an ecosystem of care-related interactions, characterized by being distributed among a large number of individuals, groups and institutions, with different competence, responsibility and commitment:  from the highly specialized actors and institutions, to family members, friends and neighbors with no specific knowledge and limited time availability. ViabilitySocial preconditions and enabling systems. To be viable, open care requires two main social preconditions:The existence of a large number of other actors (relatives, friends, neighbors) willing to care for someone, even tough they have practical limits (in terms of time and resource availability) to the possibility of doing it.The existence of dedicated and specialized actors capable to intervene when their competence are (really) needed.Given the previous social preconditions, the open care potentialities are made real thanks to the existence of a technological and organizational system capable to catalyze diffuse resources, coordinate them and give their action the needed continuity. More precisely, this enabling system should:match different demands with different offers (in terms of competence)give different care actions coherence and continuity (by the point of view of the care receiver)promote and support both relational and the highly effective ones (i.e. the most specialized, professional interventions).be organically part of a larger systems: the ecosystem of interactions that represents what today we can refer to as a local community. Social innovation and open careThe open care viability is based on the existence of a whole stream of social (and socio-technical) innovation that is already moving in a similar direction. In fact, in the complexity of contemporary society we can find several promising cases (some of them are still social prototypes, someone else is already arrived to more mature stage). For instance:Circles of care: groups of citizen sharing a same problem (as: diabetes, allergies, obesity, … or simply the old age) who mutually support each other, with the supervision of a team of doctors and nurses (a well-known example is the Circle in UK: http://www.participle.net/ageing ). Network of care: coordinated networks of family members, friends and neighbors, who share and coordinate their efforts to care for a person with serious problems (a well-known example is Tyze in Canada http://tyze.com )Intergenerational cooperation: organizations that supports the encounter of young and elderly people mainly around the theme of collaborative living (a well-known example is Prendi a casa uno studente (Take a student at home), in Italy: http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm )Collaborative inclusion: organizations of migrants and residents collaborating to produce both migrant’s inclusion and social values, for both the migrants and the whole community (an example is:  Dine with us, in Belgium: http://dinewithus.strikingly.com )   Considering these very diverse examples, we can observe that they present three fundamental common characters: (1) some care activities are delivered by non professional actors; (2) the overall care burden is shared between different subjects; (3) specialized interventions are asked only when they are really needed.  These examples are interesting because they give us an idea on how open care components could work. Nevertheless, in my view, they are not yet the full representation of the open care vision. To better approximate it, two steps should be done:To rethink each one of these service ideas adopting the radically open approach that characterizes the Open Care research.To consider the whole socio-technical ecosystem, and to improve it in order to give all of them and a multiplicity of similar ones the possibility to emerge and flourish.

By asking and tentatively answering these kinds of question, participants in the process will build shared knowledge and goals. This strategy ensures that both are firmly grounded in real-life, first-person experiences.Project Narrative and calls to action: We collaboratively synthesise the results of our sense making into a narrative structure for Op3nCare, that is going to set the scene for our interactions with one another. This includes co-designing a fair social contract and ethical guidelines for members. It also includes defining role structures (for example: participants can register as “trailblazers” sharing stories or “mentors” that help making sense of it), motivational engines (for example: badges, karma points or other forms of recognition for active users), strategic partnerships, style and aesthetics.Prototyping and testing: t.b.dPrizes: t.b.dExhibition and Summit: #lote 6 takes place in September 2017, in Milan.

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain:- Trend 1: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people…) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not.- Trend 2: many attempts to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.- Trend 3: Privacy and security concerns in the age of ubiquotous connectivity. Increasingly intimate data generated about us and shared beyond our control, or that of the institutions meant to protect our rights.Animation: current situations --- current ways of doing things-----> current (negative) futures.3.

We are aware that lot of work relevant to OpenCare does not fall into pre-defined categories. It's part of what makes it so interesting and relevant. At the same time care is such a broad topic that we need to zoom in to clearly defined instances in order for the discussions to be more concrete and directly useful to people whom we wish to connect and work with. Our solution is to drive the conversation through a number of collaboratively designed calls for contribution to the OpenCare project. We call them OP3N CHALLENGES.Please feel free to go ahead and get involved in building any of the existing OP3N CHALLENGES:1. Op3nCare Caste Story Challenge: How are you giving and receiving care?Challenge Brief: Work in progress here.2. How are care needs of people on the move (e.g. refugees) being managed?Challenge Brief: Work in progress here.3. What can we learn from past experiences on prevention of suicide in the hi-tech sector (e.g. hacker communities)?Challenge Brief: Work in progress here.4. What do promising approaches helping caregivers and receivers to better cope with dementia have in common?  Challenge Brief: Work in progress here.5. How are you exploring OpenSource, DIY and DIT solutions to meet care needs?Challenge Brief: Work in progress here.  If  you don't see what you are looking for, or if you have suggestions for more OP3N CHALLENGES, do get in touch- this project is open in the true sense of the word. Tweet your suggestion to @op3ncare or write to nadia@opencare.cc and we'll follow up A.S.A.P. Subscribe to the Op3nCare newsletter for updates coming soon. We can’t wait to see your submissions!
Op3ncare is an EU funded program made up of three things:A PLATFORM where people can share stories, ideas and insights and make new connections; A diverse and distributed COMMUNITY or network of individuals and groups, mainly in Europe but including the whole world, exploring alternative, more long-term sustainable solutions to healthcare;A PROCESS that brings people together from this community to share, inspire, connect and collaborate.The aim is to bring together people, virtually or physically, to gather and share stories, ideas and insights. Out of this will emerge new ideas, new solutions and new connections that benefit all.WHO?There are two main roles:The Op3ncarers:people who care, and are willing to share their stories about how they care. People like you! The curators: these are people who have created and maintain the platform, and curate the content. Principally this is the hosts, Edgeryders (a consultancy that specialises in community-based solutions to complex societal challenges), Ezio Manzini (a leading design strategist for social innovation), and [insert others as you think relevant], THE PROCESSWe (the curators) have devised a four stage process, described below. We invite you to engage at all and any stage.  Every single contribution is valued, whether it is telling a story, leaving a thoughtful comment, bringing cake to a community gathering or helping to build a prototype.   March 2016 - August 2016    Project phase  What we are focusing on  How to participate      Collaborative Sensing: Who and what is already out there?       Individual Stories (100)          Contribute a story: Say hello and introduce yourself  Participate in Op3n Meetups ( to receive invitations to future events, complete an Op3n Challenge)       Objective: Discover, understand, acknowledge what people are already doing      Activities: Sharing your own personal stories, interviewing people affected by the challenge topics and sharing successful initiatives or analogous examples from other areas.    It all starts with an invitation for you and others around the world to share personal experiences, observations and examples on the challenge topic. You will share stories of individuals and groups who are building alternative alternatives to existing health- or social care, as well as of others whose attempts were frustrated. The purpose of this is to build a shared repository of stories, each one embedding strategies for improving health- and social care. Some will resonate more than others with participants, and that will signal to the community that a grain of truth has been found. Collectively, we will build knowledge about new approaches towards health- and social care.       July 2016 - September 2016      Collaborative Sense Making: Where are we going? Where would we like to be going instead...and how can we get there?       Case Study Stories (20)       Join fellow Op3nCare Active Learners   Join fellow Op3nCare Practitioners  Join the Op3nCare Partnership        Objective: Analyse and structure the information shared in our conversations in such a way as to support op3ncarers desire and ability to constructively engage in society.        Activities: Using appreciative enquiry methods and playing with tools like Edgesense to find surprising connections between your experiences and those of other participants.    Whether it is because you want to solve local problems, keep governments accountable, avoid expensive mistakes or learn new things about the world in which you live,  knowledge is power. This phase links Op3nCare stories to the social, economic, political and legal context in which they happen: were they enabled by something in particular? Were they hindered by it? What change in could have made the alternative happen, or happen more successfully? By asking and tentatively answering these kinds of question, participants in the process will build shared knowledge and goals.       September 2016 - April 2017       Prototyping and Testing: How do our ideas work in practice?       Self-evaluation reports       Join the Op3nCare Partnership       Objective: t.b.c     Activities: t.b.c    Once the goals of Op3nCare participants, a range of possible strategies towards them and the obstacles in the way are reasonably clear, the project enters a new phase of hands-on, intensive peer-to-peer help. We look at each initiative and work together to connect it with the people, knowledge skills, and resources to take it to the next level.        April 2017 - September 2017      Impact: How do we take the work forward?       Caring on the Edge event, Milan  High Impact Publications  Strategic Partnerships  Spin-off Projects       It is too early to say exactly how the work will be taken forward. It will depend on the outcomes of the previous stages. What is fixed is a conference in September 2017 that will bring together all the various strands of work, and can also serve as a launchpad for new initiatives.          Objective: It is too early to say exactly how the work will be taken forward.

Op3nCare's vision is to deploy collective intelligence to the problem of designing care services by communities, for communities. This mean blurring the distinction between researchers, designers, caregivers and care receivers.  Consistently with this vision, the Op3nCare consortium has decided to make its own meetings open for anyone interested to participate. The ethos is "one day of talking, one day of doing": for every day spent on administration issues, we are setting aside another day to do hands-on stuff like design workshops, network data analysis, or hardware hacking, with doors thrown wide open. Additionally, we intend to use our meetings to partner up with, and contribute to, events organised by existing communities already working on care, collective intelligence, open source hardware and software hacking. We are aware that this marks a clean break with the tradition of closed-doors consortium meetings in European-funded research, even for projects that publish their results with open licenses, and that we are venturing in uncharted territory. But then again, that's why they call it "research".2016FEBRUARY26/2, Brussels, 09:00 -10:00 | How to cope with meltdowns in communities, Keynote by John Coate.26/2, Brussels, 09:30 -16:15 | Collaborative inclusion. How migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values.

[Progress bar: PRACTITIONERS | RESEARCH | OP3N SELECTION |  FELLOWS | PROTOTYPES | SELF ASSESSMENT | AWARDS AND FINAL EVENT] ACTIVE CHALLENGEOp3nCare PractitionersBuilding a Community of Op3nCare PractitionersWe are building a community of practitioners working at the intersections of provision of social and health care, open technologies and communities. Together our efforts shape a global discussion around health- and social care, support welfare innovators and inspire people to act. This is a space for you to introduce yourself and connect with other practitioners from around the world who are passionate about making health and social care open source, privacy-friendly and participatory. Here are a few prompts to help: What are you working on? How did you get into this work? What's a health- or social care issue you'd like to solve? Why is evaluation important to you and the movement? Those who submit to this phase of the challenge will be eligible to apply for our Op3nCare Practitioner Fellowship. Op3nCare Practitioner Fellows will receive resources and development support to create an in depth evaluation of their activities in health- and social care provision.Together with the selected Op3nCare Fellows, we'll co-create a self-evaluation and analysis process that will generate deep insights about their work, and find direct ways in which it can support, and be supported by, the broader movement to make health and social care secure, resilient and accessible for all. There will also be the opportunity to include these insights in research publications, policy recommendations. Each Op3nCare Practitioner Fellow will also receive suport to develop a high quality communication kit that they can use to promote and draw support for their work (photograph, engaging article and short video (3-4 minutes)). Most importantly, Op3nCare Practitioner Fellows will also have the chance to build authentic relationships with a cohort of creative and innovative peers who are passionate about using their knowledge to drive positive change in the movement. Our Op3nCare Practitioner Fellows will: Receive Eur X,000 in funding to support the production of their prototype development,  testing and self-evaluation reports Receive training from fellow practitioners, privacy and security experts, technologists, economists, storytellers, activists and policy experts. Have their contributions acknowledged and included in research publictations and shared on highly visible platforms Connect with other passionate practioners and activists making an impact ​To be eligible for a Practitioner fellowship we ask you to write a blogpost introducing yourself and your work. Your post must clearly convey that: Your initiative already exists and been up and running for a minimum of 6 months Your initiative is already being used/contributed to by an existing community  Your initiative iis responding to needs related to the provision of health or social care   You are genuinely interested in gaining deeper insights relevant to the work you are doing and that you will commit  at least one part-time person dedicated to the effort ​Once a post has been submitted, it will be published in a closed group on the Op3nCare platform, where Op3nCare community members will leave comments with questions and helpful suggestions to make your post even better before publishing it “live”. We appreciate how hard you are already working to run your project, so once you and the editor are happy to publish your post it on the Op3nCare blog, we give you 200 Eur. The Op3nCare Practitioner application phase will end on Month Date. We'll then review the submitted stories and and invite x/y nr. of applicants  Fellows will be selected by an advisory board of experienced care pracititioners and researchers.  
OpenCare Fellowships offer support to individuals contributing to build and understand community-driven care services. The advantages of being a Fellow are:Other Fellows! We aim to bring together the best minds and the most energetic doers in community-driven care.Some financial supportInvitation to present in OpenCare’s final event (Milan, September 2017).Your work included in OpenCare’s research resultsWe offer about 20 Research Fellowships.Research Fellowships reward high-level contributions to the OpenCare debate.Who can participate: anyone with a story of care. It can be about your project or experience, or about one you know well. To get inspired, read some of the stories already submitted. How and when to apply: respond to any one of the OpenCare challenges. We will treat any post as an application. We will offer a Research Fellowship to the authors of the most thoughtful, well-written, interesting posts. We will select about 3 new Fellows a month and announce them on our Blog, starting in May 2016 and ending in November 2016.What happens if I am offered a Research Fellowship? We offer you a small cash reward of 250 EUR. We share your post with the world. We invite you to present your work at our final event. We might ask you to comment other people's thoughts and projects.Evaluation criteria for FellowshipsWe look for entries that meet at least one of the following criteria:You: Are passionate about how we care for each other. You would love to be in touch with smart people who share your passion.Are curious, empathetic, a critical thinker. You can appreciate the potential of something even if it's scale is still small. You keep your bulls**t detector on at all times.Are practice-oriented. OpenCare Fellows are about action and how things work in practice. Opinions on what the world should look like, but doesn't, are less of a priority.The experience you describe or analyse:Responds to needs in health and social care.Is open and participatory.Has moved beyond the idea stage, to reach at least that of prototype.Uses open technology (it can also be for coordination: eg. a community clinic coordinating through a wiki).Inquiries: community@edgeryders.euThis page was last updated on Aug 18th 2016.
Opencare is an EU funded program that has come out of a Edgeryders community conversation on the future of care. It is a PLATFORM to share stories, ideas and insights, make new connections, coordinate the work; a diverse COMMUNITY or network of individuals and groups, mainly in Europe but including the whole world, exploring alternative, more long-term sustainable solutions to healthcare; a PROCESS that brings people together to share, inspire, connect and collaborate. Op3nCare is the community we are building in symbiosis with the research project, but is distinct from it and is meant to continue long after the research project has ended.The aim is to bring together people, virtually or physically, to gather and share stories, ideas and insights. Out of this will emerge new ideas, new solutions and new connections that benefit all. Our challenges, projects, and programs are modeled on Edgeryders collective intelligence methodology. This means that we enable our community to develop solutions rooted in people's everyday realities, needs, and lifestyles.VALUESTry to support and build on what is already there. We start by sharing experiences and research. We do this to discover what is already out there, what is needed by initiatives and the communities they serve. In doing this collaboratively, we increase collective knowledge. We also encourage peers in the movement to acknowledge one another’s good work and build on it, rather than waste resources on duplicating or competing with initiatives.Help one another to improve y(our) ability to analyze and interpret information. We analyse and structure the information shared in our conversations to support community members' desire and ability to constructively engage in society through and about facts, statistics and other pieces of information. In a world of ubiquitous digital connectivity, improving access and use of information helps us navigate meaningfully current ecosystems and societies. Whether it is because you want to solve local problems, keep governments accountable, avoid expensive mistakes or learn new things about the world in which you live, knowledge is power.Keep in mind that we are a diverse community. This is critical: almost anything we can achieve rests on that diversity, so the social contract needs to preserve and enhance it. It is essential that we stay wide open to an influx of new people, insights and skills. This means that we  can never be a membership-based organization. The minute you draw a line and say “Here, we are on this side, the outside world is on that side”, the community begins to asphyxiate and die. This means we accept and take into account that individuals should be able to choose their own role, as long as it does not limit the autonomy of others. Who does the work, calls the shots. The focus of any interaction should be to empower and encourage each one of us to do things. No one gets to sit on the sidelines and tell people not to do things. If you want to make something better, you can add thoughtful suggestions. The suggestions most likely to be implemented are ones which are backed with an offer of hands-on help from the persons making them. ROLESThere are two main roles:The Op3ncarers: people who care, and are willing to share their stories about how they care.

Make sense and build new knowledge: Whether it is because you want to solve local problems, keep governments accountable, avoid expensive mistakes or learn new things about the world in which you live,  knowledge is power. This phase links Op3nCare stories to the social, economic, political and legal context in which they happen: were they enabled by something in particular? Were they hindered by it? What change in could have made the alternative happen, or happen more successfully? By asking and tentatively answering these kinds of question, participants in the process will build shared knowledge and goals. START: JULY, 2016.3. Develop new ideas and see how they work in practice: Once the goals of Op3nCare participants, a range of possible strategies towards them and the obstacles in the way are reasonably clear, the project enters a new phase of hands-on, intensive peer-to-peer help. We look at each initiative and work together to connect it with the people, knowledge skills, and resources to take it to the next level. START: SEPTEMBER 2016.4. Defining how we take the work forward: It is too early to say exactly how the work will be taken forward. It will depend on the outcomes of the previous stages. What is fixed is a conference in September 2017 that will bring together all the various strands of work, and can also serve as a launchpad for new initiatives.  START: APRIL 2017. 
Julia Reda, the only Pirate MEP, is up for coming to LOTE5. We had discussed this possibility back at 32C3.She is part of a group of European lawmakers concerned with software transparency. That includes cars (the infamous Volkswagen diesel engines), Internet of Things, implants etc. I asked her to say something like:Europe is attempting to regulate software transparency. This has consequences for medical (implants, prosthetics) and social (sensors) care. This gives us some windows for impact: that is, how OpenCare's results could be useful to which regulatory processes. Strategically, I like the idea to start working with lawmakers at the beginning of OpenCare. We might increase our impact by spinning off reports and memos that Julia and others like her find useful, and deploy on their parliamentary activity.I propose we put it in the OpenCare Files session, which is at this point from 16.30 to 17.30 on Friday 26th. I suggest we do only one thing in that session: a Q&A discussion introduced by a robust intro on "debunking welfare" by @markomanka. Marco could equally play host, asking some participants to come forward and linking what they have to say to the main theme. Such "special participants (or panelists, if you like) could be:Julia herself (transparency of software and care).@Luciascopelliti or @Rossana Torri (prototyping community welfare: what works and what does not).@Costantino or @zoescope (DIY aids for care).I expect that @Lakomaa might have something to add to Julia's points on regulation. If Simona shows up, we'll figure out how to fir her in. Do you all agree?
Op3nCare is a global community working together to make health- and social care accessible for all, open source, privacy-friendly and participatory. It starts from the assumption that state and private institutions will be unable to meet the demands for care in the 21st century and that new, more open, participatory, community-based methods are required.SIGN UP | JOIN AN OPEN MEETUP | ABOUT THIS PLATFORM!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");                                    Getting started is easy! To find and connect with others over shared interests, we recommend you do three things:                                            Sign up for the daily headlines - It's our curated list of three best-of posts on opencare related topics                                                Create an Edgeryders account, upload a picture you like, and add a short biography/description                                                 Let your fellow community members know a little more about you - share your story in a post.                                                                                         
In the same line as what the LOTE5 food team is doing, here are some ingredients you may want to taste before we meet at MoN4.As explained on the MoN4 page, we will be looking at a compilation of conversations that took place on the edgeryders portal – something in the flavor of what OpenCare could be dealing with in a near future.That is, the conversations we will be looking at are still visible on edgeryders.eu (Alberto, correct me if I’m wrong. You can probably also specify which project we are dealing with.)What you should do before we meetFor those who have time. Just project yourself in the task of monitoring and/or understanding what is happening in the community, based on the content of online interactions.Come up with questions you’d need to elucidate. Examples are:Would it be useful to see the process in action, seeing how comments get posted and thus attached to initial posts? How do actors distribute among posts? Are posts all connected (a walk from person to comment to person to comment to … ultimately leads to visit everyone and every post)?What topics do people discuss about? Does everyone discuss about all topics, do subgroups specialize around some topics? Do some user peck from topic to topic? Do people on average focus on a few topics?Visualize it!We’ll be using visualization as much as possible during MoN4 to trigger discussion, to illustrate ideas and communicate on our findings and approaches.We rely on a rather simple methodology that is perfectly illustrated in the figure below.Initiate questions, and at the same time collect anything you believe may be useful (shoebox).Refine questions, structure and organize shoebox into duly exploitable data.Formulate hypothesis, and ultimately test hypothesis whenever possible.Use images, and more usefully interactive sessions to let the data speak and back your hypothesis/conclusions.Next step is: what material do we have to try to answer these questions?DataConversations are compiled in a somehow cumbersome manner by data geeks, but I nevertheless post here all the json files (coming soon) for those who like raw meat (I’m joking, just teasing the vegan crowd who is pampering the meals for LOTE5 J).A user file listing all users registered on edgeryders (not all of them did participate in the conversations that were collected). A post file listing all messages posted on edgeryders by users, either as a first post or as comment in a thread. Additional files to support the mining of all this semantic and user soup.
WhyCare happens in networks. People take care of each other. They seek advice, medical help and moral support from each other. They exchange knowledge and share resources. They meet, interact, and work together. And, of course, no human can live well if he or she disconnects from the fabric of society at large (in recent times, care also happened in big bureaucracies, but that approach has issues. Here we look for something better).We think that this ceaseless exchange is collective intelligence at work. Network analysis is a useful tool to understand this process, and perhaps find ways to improve upon it. Thinking in networks is a great way to generate fresh, relevant questions. How do you know your network is going in the right direction? What is a “direction” in this context? Is everyone following the same path? Do people group into sub-communities? What are the focus of these (sub) communities? WhatWe come together to find out how networked humans can better take care of each other. To do this, we study result-oriented conversations. Conversations are networks: people are its nodes, and the exchanges are its links. It you don't believe us, click here to explore the Edgeryders conversation network (allow a few seconds for the data to download). But conversations are networks also in another sense: each exchange contains some concepts. Example of concepts useful in care are: well-being, syringe, diabethes, fitness, prosthetics, etc. We can represent concept in a conversation as a network. Concepts themselves are its nodes; two concepts are linked if they are in the same exchange. Person-to-person conversation networks tell us who is talking to whom. Are there individuals who act as "hubs"? Why? Can we use hubs to improve the process, for example asking them to spread important knowledge? Concept-to-concept conversation networks tell us how the different concepts connect to each other. Are there surprises? Do apparently unrelated concepts tend to come up in the same exchanges? Anomalies might mean something interesting is going on. In fact, spotting anomalies is how John Snow invented epidemiology in 1854. The fascinating part is this: by looking at the network, we can extract information that no individual in the network has. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Collective intelligence! HowWe look at conversation data taken from Edgeryders and build them into a network. We use open source software for network analysis. We then visualize and interrogate the network to see what we can learn. Our final aim is to prototype methodologies for extracting collective intelligent outcomes from conversations.One great output from the workshop would be to unleash our imagination, and specify design & requirements:What views works best? It'll be useful to build it as a mockup if we do not already have it -- use color pens, paper, clips, cardboard and build it into a mock-up!For what tasks? Do we need to move things around? Pile them up to trigger comparison of things on-the-fly? Lasso an item to trigger some computation? -- use post-it notes, cut and paste pieces of paper, draw arrows to turn tasks into real actions (on a screen!).Using what ingredient (data)? What should we feed the system with to accomplish these analytical tasks? -- write them down, cut & paste, associate them with specific tasks, embed them into views.The workshop is a unique opportunity to have a design participatory workshop -- we want it to be a source of inspiration to design and build the next generation EdgeSense dashboard!Who should comeMasters of Networks is open to all, and especially friendly to beginners. Patients, network scientists, doctors, hackers and so on all have something to contribute. But in the end we are all experts in this domain. We all give and receive care in the course of our lives, and all humans are expert conversationalists.  There's an extra bonus for beginners: networks are easy to visualize. And when you visualize them, as we will, they are often beautiful and intuitive. Trust us. We have done this before (check out the video above).DataWe have a dataset drawn from a large conversation that took place on the Edgeryders platform in 2014. It consists of 161 posts and 910 comments, authored by 128 different people. All posts and comments have been annotated by a professional ethnographer. This leaves us with an ontology of relevant concepts: we can use it to build the network. That conversation was not about care. We will need to be clever, and use different data to figure out a methodology to apply to a future conversation about care. Agenda and challengesThe agenda is simple:We will spend the first hour and a half explaining how the data were formed, harvested and converted into a network. We will explore the network together using a software called Detangler, brainchild of the wonderful @brenoust. Detangler is highly intuitive: we can use it to manipulate network without knowing any network math at all. Then, we'll hack. We can explore the data in many directions. Depending on how many we are, we can split into groups that look at different things. We see at least three possibilities:Visualization challenge. Create informative and beautiful visualizations starting from our data. Skills needed: design, dataviz, netviz. Coordinator: @melancon (you can call me Guy)​Its not only about creativity and beauty, it's about interactivity -- a map seen as a malleable object so you can squirk information out of it.It's also about being able to specify graphical design from the tasks you'd need to conduct on the data and its representation on the screen. How is a node-link view useful? How would you intuitively like to manipulate, filter or change it at will when exploring it? Would you feel you need to synchronize the view with a bar chart on some statistics? A scatterplot to figure out if things correlate?Interpretation challenge. How many conclusions and hypotheses can we "squeeze" from the data? Skills needed: social research, ethnography, network science. Coordinator: @Noemi?Interpretation is at the core of the process. You play with data, you map it, and iteratively build hypothesis. In the end, you dream you would have provable claims.Quality challenge. Can we think of simple criteria to filter the data for the highest-quality content only (eg: only posts with a minimum number of comments, or of minimum length)? Does the filtering change the results? Coordination: @AlbertoAnd more. But we insist that every group has a coordinator, who takes responsibility for driving it, sharing the relevant material (examples: software libraries, notes for participants, pseudo code...). If we only have two coordinators, we'll only have two groups. If you think you can lead a group, get in touch with us!Tentative schedule9h30 - 11h - @Alberto and @melancon (@Hazem @Noemi) give a start by drawing the overall picture, following the famous adagio "A picture is worth a thousand words".11h - 12h30 Teams give it a first shot The viz team will play a game building their ideal visual dashboard using pen and paper, cardboard -- explaining why these features may turn to be essential when exploring or analyzing network data. The interpretation team output is critical: the directions they will provide has decisive impact on how data will be used, massaged and turned into visual representations. The qualitative team plays a similar role, feeding the intepretation team with high quality content -- their recommendations will make even greater sense if we can link them with paths of interpretation.12h30 - 14h Feed your brain with proteins and glucids.14h - 16h Teams go back to work and build a proof-of-concept of the ideas /hypothesis they came up with in the morning session. Cross-fertilization of ideas with the other teams is encouraged. People may wish to change teams to widen their experience and knowledge. Teams prepare a short summary of their findings/conclusions that will be presented during the wrap-up session.16h - 16h30 Wrap-up.

On January 21-22 I participated in NOW, a 2 day event bringing together mayors from cities and towns receiving the largest numbers of refugees from Syria as well as activists and individuals currently seeking asylum in Europe. I will dedicate this post to a brief summary of the key issues highlighted by participants, followed by proposals for how we could contribute towards building actionable and sustainable solutions.The first part of the event consisted in a kind of intense briefing of the situation in countries closest to Syria. In a short time the populations of small countries in the region, Lebanon and Jordan, have grown manyfold (1.1 Million refugees in Lebanon, 630,000 in Jordan - in addition to Palestinian refugees already there). Some reading materials with up to date, detailed information:Armenia: Anna’s report from Yerevan is a good introduction. Jordan: Five Years On | Syria Crisis-related needs and vulnerabilities in Jordan.  While many of the cities and towns receiving refugees face similar challenges there is a significant difference. Some are transit locations, which asylum seekers pass on their way on to other destinations. They include major cities in Greece, Italy and Turkey, as well as small coastal towns from which people leave on boats to take their perilous journey across the sea. There, volunteers do their best to care for their immediate physical needs and the mandated administrative/security procedures to grant them entry onto the mainland.Other cities and towns  are receiving the newcomers on a more long term basis. This happens in two different phases, each one posing its own  political, administrative and infrastructural challenges for the hosting communities. The first one is the period of time between arrival and the approval or rejection of the person’s application for refugee status. This period could be very long, as in the case of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, or that of Mr. Teferi in Norway. The second one is the period that begins once an individual has secured refugee status. In this period, the challenge is navigating the difficult period between receiving the papers and being fully established in the social and economic life of the host new community.While the details differ, the problems and needs mentioned by mayors, NGOs and activists fall into one or more of the following:Resource efficiency: How to get better at covering necessities of both refugees and citizens/ residents on very limited resources? As an example Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries in the world and 70 per cent of the population suffers from inadequate water supply below the national standard of 100 liters/person/day. Aging infrastructures, inefficiencies in operation and maintenance. interrupted provision of water services etc. Could resource scarcity be mitigated through Open Source technologies for recycling of sewage, seawater desalination at scale, deep drip irrigation etc? Affordable, modifiable technologies are required to manage the current crisis as well as to secure peace in the region.Interoperability, knowledge transfer and Institutional memory: I heard many calls to “make information available about how the system works”, and "calls for online platforms to fix a perceived lack of information" thought to be a "key obstacle for labor market access". Here too I head that “we need a database of all the initiatives and resources available to help refugees” and "we need to make existing information about getting your paperwork done, how to set up a new business etc". There are three underlying assumptions: 1) That some people understand in detail “how the system works” as a whole and 2) That they can transmit that kind knowledge into brochures or documents and that 3) This information material will make the system navigable and penetrable for newcomers. These three assumptions do not hold up to scrutiny and could fill an entire blogpost with reasons as to why. For now I will simply refer you to the Brickstarter report as it is a light, beginner-friendly introduction to some of the issues.Scalability of public services: How to build/rethink provision of public services so that they can accommodate changes in the number of people to serve? Many of the participants complained about the lack of resources to provide education or training for newcomers. Others mentioned the provision of health and social care services, especially psychological support for the traumatised. I heard a lot of calling for more resources to be put into existing services, but little examination of how existing services are performing and even less awareness about more effective, flexible and cost-efficient approaches. Are we sure that throwing money onto more of the same will result in better outcomes?  Sugata Mitra’s work on Minimally Invasive Education, Miguel Chavez’s experienced from building Makerspaces in Favelas, Freifunk and many others offer alternative approaches with promising results. The political will, and practical ability, to welcome and accommodate newcomers depends on it. In this recent talk, I present a proposal for how we can break out of the zero-sum thinking in the provision of care services as an antidote to rising social tensions between social groups.One of the outcomes of the conference was that Mayors from Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Italy and Austria signed a declaration to work together in solidarity across borders:Politically, this is an important signal. However the event didn’t get into the part I find the most interesting- how they expect to go from intention to implementation.So what is needed in order for this commitment to be delivered on? Based on discussions with mayors, activists and refugees it looks like the participants at NOW need:Efficient and sustainable coordination across geographic, linguistic and technological barriers.A globe-spanning sustained effort to help community leaders, mayors, politicians and fight back against populist rhetoric and divisive narratives.Ability to learn about and experiment with novel or unconventional approaches towards tackling root causes of problems which affect both newcomers and the host communities which welcome them.In practice this would require:Active engagement of a lot of affected people in mapping and making sense of urgent problems related to a sudden influx of newcomers in education, housing, employment/entrepreneurship, language/social skills and finance. The reason being that those affected will only get behind efforts to solve problems if they trust the people involved, and have shared ownership in the process. Part of what builds trust is if people can recognise their own perspective, language and experiences in the description of the situation. That they are taken seriously as experts in their own lives- that their own ambitions, words and thoughts weigh at least as much as input of credentialed domain experts (who may never have set foot in the neighborhood). This was echoed by newcomers frustrated by discussions about training them to fit into pre-defined slots in society, based on what they perceived to be unfounded assumptions by institutional actors about what they could or could not achieve: “Do not put a cap on my dreams, just give me access to the tools and see what I can build with them”.​Continuous mapping and connection of different private, public and third sector actors efforts into coherent shared plans that take into consideration the budgetary, logistical and political constraints within which each group is working. I can tell you from experience that is it not easy. The reason being that the incentives are aligned against it. We all agree that at the system level good documentation saves everyone time and resources. At the individual level it is more difficult to motivate the additional investment of time and effort. Where you see people doing this consistently is where it is a part of a shared culture and work ethos. To get this going you have to create the incentives for people to do additional work involved, instill the ethos, teach people the workflow and enforce it top down. Over and over. Until there is a critical mass doing it and others can share the effort of spreading and maintaining the enabling culture.Take a minute to think about what this means.If the participants in the event want to see the transnational cooperation happen in practice, then they will have to learn to think and work as networks of individuals interacting inside, outside and all around different organisations. Each working at the hyperlocal, micro-level, while sharing and learning with others working in different contexts as a natural part of the everyday workflow… not just something afforded to people who can travel and spend 2 days talking with one another at a conference. And all of this done in ways that build granular, immediately relevant and continuously updated institutional memory accessible to all. Affecting behavioral change at this scale is hard, but it can be done.I think we can contribute in two ways.1. At LOTE5 we are organising this reflexive design exercise on Collaborative inclusion: how migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values. The event is run by Ezio Manzini, one the world's leading designers for social innovation. You can partner with us if you want to help make it into a workshop on addressing specific problems tied to reception and inclusion of asylum seekers. Or just sign up and participate.2. We also have a way to produce cheap, accurate ethnographic data around problems like the ones mentioned above, with a focus on surfacing creative and actionable solutions. This would enable you to engage a large number of participants (thousands) in a participatory process for designing solutions to meet their own needs. This methodology is being employed/supported by a growing number of actors including the current Swedish minister of Nordic cooperation and strategic foresight, the European Commission, the Rockefeller Foundation, the United Nations Development Program and United Nations Volunteers as well as the cities of Milan and Matera in Italy, and of Bucharest in Romania. We have developed a methodological guide for doing this - email me if you would like a copy (cannot post online): nadia@edgeryders.eu. 
Hello all, @Ezio Manzini and I have had some discussion and come up with a new, much improved, event page. We have also claimed the empty slot in the OpenCare files, which has been pushed to 16.00. @markomanka's and Simona Ferlini's talk should go here. This is really high quality stuff, and deserves plenty of exposure. @Nadia, @Noemi, @ireinga.@KiraVde, I need a picture and short bio of your father. Thanks!
Just heard about a hackathon in Geneva, April 16-18, about open data in health. http://theport.ch/home/open-geneva-2016-campus-biotech/Obvious overlap with opencare -- to the point I had to check it wasn't an opencare event I was hearing about through an indirect route!Applications close on February 7th. 
Storytelling Workshop for people working on initiatives related to care (health- and/or social care) in their community. As well as for those who are curious to learn more about them.The purpose of this workshop is to help protagonists of grassroots and social innovation projects make it easier to engage support for their work through effective communication materials.You will:- Meet others doing relevant work and learn from one another's experiences- Learn about effective communication for engaging support in your projects- Create a professional quality communication kit for you/your project (press photos, a short video, as well as an engaging article)- Find it useful no matter if you are a beginner or have been doing this for yearsWhen: 28/2/2016, 9:00-19:00Location: SmartBe, rue Emile Féron 70 – 1060 BruxellesPrice: Free of charge for LOTE5 ticket holders, lunch is included.Registration: Please fill in this form  http://bit.ly/1SWoWV7Organisers:The Narratives of Care Storytelling workshop is part of the OpenCare initiative championed by Edgeryders Lbg, a not-for-profit company living in symbiosis with the Edgeryders community.

Just noticed that health is one of the topics for this year's re:publica.Seems like a good opportunity for somebody to run an opencare event. Deadline for submitting a proposal is Jan 10th; details at https://re-publica.de/en/call-papers
OpenCare will officially start in three days. A few of us are in 32C3 (@Lakomaa, @zoescope, @Costantino, @Nadia and myself).  We are doing good work. Nadia onboarded several people, including Marie Moe – a computer security expert who wears a pacemaker and has discovered it's buggy, hackable and untransparent since it runs on proprietary software –  https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7273.html@msanti, @mstn, @maxlath and I did some work on the "Visualizing self-diagnosis" project (GitHub – at the time of writing most stuff is on the wiki, because almost all we do is struggle with Wikipedia and Wikidata's data models). We talked to Pirate Party MEP Julia Reda, and decided to stay in touch with a view to giving the European Parliament some ammo to regulate care in a community-friendly direction. Julia has provisionally agreed to show up at LOTE5, and to have a look at points of entry we might use to put OpenCare's results at the disposal of policy makers. What it comes down to: if we do good work, we'll get impact. Looking forward to this, friends. See you in 2016. No surrender. 
Engineering meets biomatter. The squiggly squishy, compliant bits of biomechanics allow you to produce one size fits all. If someone has physical disability, like cerebral paulsy, giving them a little bit of improved mobility can have huge positive effects.Functionally grated structures: Inspired by Bird beaks: Hydrophobic proteins and high water content parts of the body. Example where functional grating is applied: Cerebral palsy- Cost of therapy is very expensive because one on one time with specialists are very costly, and tech used is not modifiable.- so they build soft exoskeletons for actuators (for joints) using functional grating principles. Check out their "Neucuff"Another example where functional grating is used: ProstheticsUses distributed force: see goats' feet as a reference/description of the principle used to build prosthetics.- Feets that are hard metal pads (hard actuators) does not allow you to compensate for unexpected events.- Also flies' spatulated hairs on their feet. N++1. Aron Parnell tries to mass manufacture.Last example: Replacing atmospheric preassure in space suits with pneumatic preassure, shrinking them to fit human body. Problem: Spring effect. Solution: Don't make mechanical counterpressure suit in one go, but gradually? (not sure I got this right)
In a recent call, @melancon and I realized we had lost the overview on the discussion about building a visualization of self-diagnosis based on Wikipedia data. This is because this discussion was held in more threads than one. I fished out a comment that recaps most of what we know on available data and methods. I copy it below for retrievability (see here if you want to read it on context). Page view stats are easy. Wikipedia maintains hourly dumps of all page views stats (documentation). Notice that IPs are not included in the stats.The difficult part is disentangling the pages about care from the pages about everything else. This cannot be done directly (it is not a field of the dataset); it has to be done by association. There are two ways to do that:by ontology. There is a Wikiproject Medicine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine which even maintains its own statistics page. It follows that there is somewhere a piece of code that knows how to tell pages which are part of this project from pages which are not ("Medical articles are determined to be those NS0 articles tagged within the scope of WP:MED according to a category dump at the time of report generation"). Somewhere, someone has that code and could give it to us. by emergence, based (you guessed it) on  the network of links connecting different entries to each other. Within Wikipedia, you can expect to see pages about medicine to cluster into a community of pages more closely connected to each other than to the rest of the encyclopedia. Something like this seems to be done by tools like WikiLoopr (try it: for example http://www.wikiloopr.com/diabetes)There are at least three interesting questions concerning OpenCare that you could address by looking at Wikipedia data:Which entries are people looking up (hint: not necessarily the ones you would think)? Is that indication of self-diagnosis going on? What can we learn about that (example: are some countries more inclined to do that than other countries?). This is a non-network question.How does collective intelligence in Wikipedia relate pages about care to each other? How does this compare to a similar web of relationship, but derived from academic datasets? This question pertains to networks of documents (Wikipedia entries) connected by hyperlinks (somebody did it in 2007).How does collective intelligence proceed in building that content? This question pertains to a network of Wikipedians connected by affiliation (having edited the same page). There are many visualizations to look up for inspiration. Additional resources:MediaWiki API documentationPython code to extract a social network of edits from a MediaWiki dumpWikisearch, a tool that computes networks of documents centered on a give article.

SoundSight Training will help blind people honing their listening to be more aware of the space around them.Developing a technology for blind people looked really challenging.At first we tried to develop something that could sense and reconstruct reality for them, a cane on steroids of sort.But while becoming closer, friends with them, our vision started changing: we were more and more exposed to their small habits, to their stories,  their successes and frustrations.And we realized that they didn’t need a technology that would mediate their perception of the environment, they really needed ways to interact with their surrounding as naturally as possible.But have I introduced us yet? We are @IreneLanza, @markomanka and Henrik Kjeldesen and it’s our pleasure and pride to present SoundSight Training, an educational tool, as the name suggests, to develop and hone the innate ability of humanking to explore one’ surroundings beyond the use of sight.In boring technical details, it is an acoustic virtual reality that simulates in real time the diffusion, reflection and distortion of user emitted sounds in different environments, offering small variations to capture the consequent modulation of sound features in a trial and error learning process, mediated by appropriate feedback about the results.Our mission is to make this tool as accessible as possible, and open source, to be owned and tinkered around by its community, and for this reason we are slowly and organically onboarding hackers, and blind people alike, like our friends, Cecilia, Luca and Matteo.True to this vision, we have turned to crowdfunding as the fundraising strategy of choice, and we are trying to exploit the kickstarter campaign and press attention to mobilitate people, and to experience holding a stake into the success of this adventure.We aim at allowing millions of blind people to train their hearing, and to learn how to echolocate and navigate in living environments.So, down to the important question: would you like to help us? ;)https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/960729924/soundsight-training-allow-blind-people-to-see-with 
Some OpenCarers will be in Hamburg for 32C3. Confirmed: @Nadia, @zoescope, @Costantino and myself. Should we do something OpenCare-related? Hint: yes. This is a really interesting community. Two possibilities, not mutually exclusive:a lightning talk. Who is up for doing it?some hacking, maybe with a view towards the famous network hackathon we have been talking about. @Lakomaa, @markomanka, @melancon: are you coming after all?
Our friend @jimmytidey attended the meeting and did a writeup, which I think is well worth reading – especially on the ethics of data sharing. @Costantino, could you move it to the pinboard?
I've seen many of this project during the years but ...is'nt this openCare?? :)  What was your goal in building this project?Feeding my grandfather is challenging because we were squeezing blended food through ordinary syringes. The feed rate must be slow to keep my grandfather comfortable (not feel bloated). We cannot rush and it also takes a lot of strength. I wanted to make this easier for everybody, as my aunts and uncles do not have unlimited days off, and I really don’t think grandmother has the strength to do this task alone.http://www.bocabearings.com/innovation-contest/ContestantDetails.aspx?ProjectID=221
The French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) and the French infrastructure BIOBANQUES in collaboration with ISC have a pleasure of inviting to the seminar entitled “COP21 Responding to Health and Data Challenges. Case for Climate Change and Atmospheric Pollution”, dedicated to the question of optimal climate change policy responses to support data analytics usage for health research. Microbiome will be discussed as a case for relevance of systemic approach towards collecting and analysing environment around humans, especially agriculture, and translating findings to a healthcare and environmental policy.Purpose of the meeting:In relation to the Global Agreement to be adopted by the COP21 conference, the planned meeting will focus on areas of health data allowing bio-monitoring of climate related diseases, as well as the wide theme of microbiome and influence of ecosystem on human health. The main objective of the seminar is to outline possible project ideas in above mentioned areas, which would build the case for sustained action by estimation and compilation of the burden of climate changes and the main risk factors, the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions, the unmet need for prevention and treatment services, and the need for interventions outside the health sector.Date: 4 December 2015,Time: 10.00 – 16.00Venue: INSERM, 101, rue de Tolbiac, 75013, Paris; 10th floor, room 132 For further information, registration and draft agenda go to: http://www.iscintelligence.com/event.php?id=294Please, register ASAP due to limited space.Deadline for registration: 2 December 2015.Magdalena PacholskaKey RelationshipsISC Intelligence in Science Rue du Trone 4 B-1000 Brussels Tel: +32 2 8888111Mob: +32 470 208 295www.iscintelligence.com
Excellent use of data to portray this growing crisis."It’s been called the largest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. But while the stories of people fleeing violence and oppression have shocked the world, grasping the scale of the number of migrants seeking asylum on the continent can be difficult.That’s where Lucify, a data visualization company based in Helsinki, hopes to help. The company used data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the origin and destination of all the refugees in its database over three years to create an interactive graphic of the mass movement of people into Europe."http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/10/28/map-that-shows-how-huge-europes-refugee-crisis-really-is?cmpid=tp-fb
The OpenCare consortium consists of:The University of BordeauxEdgerydersScimPulse FoundationThe City of MilanWeMake - Makerspace and Fablab   The Stockholm School of EconomicsWe formed around a need that emerged within the Edgeryders community in the course of an event called Living On The Edge 4. The main idea was, and still is, that hacker culture and the availability of cheap and open but advanced technology (not only software, but hardware and wetware too) can contribute to ideating and providing care services – at a time Europe badly needs innovation in this domain. Furthermore, services designed and deployed by skilled communities of hackers are likely to be very different from those provided by the state and the private sector. The discussion proved that tackling the issue of community-drive care required a strongly interdisciplinary approach, covering many areas of expertise. We identified the main ones as follows:Collective intelligence: how can a community function as a knowledge engine?Domain expertise on care: how can communities interface with the academic debate on what constitutes care and how it should be done?Design: how can we bring state-of-the-art design for sustainability and service design practices into designing care provision?Open hardware: how can rapid prototyping and open hardware platforms be used in the participatory design of care services?Public policy design and evaluation: how can community-driven care services be integrated in the highly sensitive, highly regulated landscape of European care provision?
You enter the Metropolitan Community Clinic at Helliniko from a nondescript parking lot in suburban Athens, in an area that hosts a decommissioned American military base. It does not look like much. But it is. It is a very big deal indeed.The MCCH saves people. It provides health care to down-on-their-luck Greeks who have no access to public health care and no money to pay for private clinics. There are many such people, because in Greece access to the national health service is tied to employment. When Greeks lose their jobs, they have a grace period of one year: they'd better find another job within that period, because if they don't they are out of health insurance. If they fall sick, they have to come up with something, or die.It's not just Greeks. It turns out in every European Union countries but the United Kingdom and Italy, employment is a pre-requisite for access to health care. But Greece was hit hardest by the 2008 crisis: many more people than elsewhere have turned into long-term unemployed. Everyone is struggling: “We had poor people ten years ago, too – shrugs Maria, a psychologist volunteering at MCCH – but at that time people could fall back on their families, or their neighbors, for help. Not anymore: their families and neighbors are themselves in trouble, and there's little they can do. People are getting desperate.”In 2011, some senior doctors started comparing notes, and they saw a perfect health care storm brewing at the horizon. “We knew something very bad was coming, and people would die – says Maria – so we decided we must do something.”“Something” in this case turned out to be the MCCH itself. This is a very strange animal as health care providers go.It has no legal existence. Its literature proudly proclaims: “ MCCH is a volunteer organization without Legal or Taxable status and it is not a 'Non-Profit-Making-Organisation'.” Maria: "We are technically illegal".It does not accept donations in money. It does accept donations in kind: medicines, equipment, blood sample analyses.It operates from a building that belongs to the Municipality of Helliniko-Argyropoulis. Though none of its employees works in the building, the Municipality still pays the electricity and phone bills that the MCCH generates. My heart goes out to the anonymous “bureaucrat hacker” that entrusted a government building to an informal group of citizens, which by definition cannot sign contracts or participate in tenders.It is very autonomous with respect to institutions and power. MCCH was recently proposed for the European Parliament European Citizen's Prize 2015, but they very publicly turned it down. Reason: "Europe is an important cause of the problem we exist to address. Don't give us awards, change your policy".It treats only people who have no access to the public health care system. One exception: low-income families with many children, who are living hand-to-mouth on 450 euro a day and simply cannot afford to buy medicines (Maria: “It happens”).On top of diagnosis/prognosis, MCCH supplies free medicines, baby food and nappies.It has 300 volunteers, of which a little over half are doctors of various specialisations and pharmacists.It operates with practically no hierarchy and no management. People decide by themselves what role to play, by joining one of several groups (about 10 members to a group) which exist to carry on specific tasks (like onboarding new patients). An organising committee does its best to keep people on the same page. A weekly meeting votes on general issues. A mailing list deals with specific matters.When they are not volunteering with MCCH, volunteers exchange services and small favours through a time bank: two massages against one hour of English lessons etc.There are now 68 such clinics in Greece. Take a moment to think about what this means: in four years, thousands of enterprising Greeks with no money, no command structure and who do not even know each other have created a parallel health care system that succeeds where the public health service and private sector services both fail: it keeps reasonably safe the poorest strata of the population. Notice that the Greek health care budget in 2011 was over 6 billion euro.Wait. Self-organised people with no money and no organisation that beat credentialed, moneyed professionals at their own game? We've seen this before. It was Wikipedia outcompeting Encyclopedia Britannica. It was OpenStreetMap pushing to the curbs Garmin and TomTom. It was Facebook groups coordinating disaster relief after the Nepal 2015 earthquakes and the Tbilisi 2015 flash flood, way before the government and NGOs could get their act together. It was Internet-coordinated young newcomers changing the rules of the political game, and even bringing down entire regimes who seemed to have all the power and all the money, in Egypt, Tunisia and Ukraine.We have a word for these phenomena: we call them disruption. They are associated with supplying goods or services in a new way, that substitutes collective intelligence and distributed effort for vertical organisations. This new way happens to be vastly more efficient than the old ones.I think the time has come for disruption in health care, and in care services in general. Why? Because, as the OECD pointed out, per capita health care expenditure grows much faster than GDP. In 1970, health care absorbed a respectable 5.2% of the GDP of the average OECD country. In 2008, it absorbed 10.1% (source). The system is under strain, and often – like in Greece, it reacts by denying care to those who most need it. This is morally unacceptable, wasteful and stupid – especially when the Metropolitan Community Clinic at Helliniko and so many other experiences like it, in the world of care and outside it, has proven how much farther communities can go in taking care of their members when they are enabled to do it.So, we are getting involved. Edgeryders has partnered up with five world-class organisations in research (University of Bordeaux, Stockholm School of Economics, ScimPulse Foundation), welfare policy-making (City of Milan) and digital fabrication (WeMake) to find, learn from, and enhance the experiences like MCCH all around the world. Our goal is a model of community-driven care services, based on modern science and open technology, but with the low overhead and human touch that communities can provide and large bureaucracies cannot. Our project is called OpenCare; the European Commission has generously agreed to support it through its Collective Awareness Platforms programme.Whoever you are you are welcome to join us. After all, if you are human, you have considerable experience of giving and receiving care, and that makes you an expert. If you want to participate, or simply to know more, start here.Photo: Theophilos Papadopoulos on flickr.com

My personal interest in community driven care is it's ability to take into account, and answer to, the different dimensions of well-being and interlinking of different kinds of need...beyond the healthy/sick dichotomy. Susanne Stauch is running an OpenCare product design course at UDK, the largest Art and Design university in Europe. We developed the concept and course together, it's taking shape here. The focus is developing helpers, and looking at the social aspects of care, so Im going to be focused on this for a while :)This article popped up in my feeds (don't ask) today and it reminded me of this post I wrote about rituals around death and mourning (or lack thereof) in contemporary culture:"Ideally, this exercise in death could also emphasize the fact that each of us is here for a reason. And that each of us has a unique set of gifts, talents, experience and wisdom to share. If we are not utilizing these in some way - both to bring us joy and to help others in some way - then both we as a collective, as well as some individuals (whom we may never know) - suffer from this loss - whether we realize this or not. If we are not actively shining our light - the world becomes a darker place." - Linda K.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3284587/Learn-dead-day-Suicidal-people-locked-coffins-bizarre-death-experience-schools-South-Korea-40-people-kill-day.html  
A lot of non-techn(olog)ical hacking can be thought of in "care"...https://www.facebook.com/AlexLeeWorld/videos/vb.580326075440714/940431519430166/?type=2&theater
Doing public presentations is an inevitable part of building new projects and reaching out to potential clients and partners. It's also a costly investment of time and we owe it to one another to help improve the returns. This post is the first in a series where I share my own notes and reflections from talks, worshops etc. Hopefully others will do the same so we can learn together...Yesterday I presented the OpenCare project to an audience for the first time at Politics For Tomorrow, an event organised by @Caroline_Paulick-Thiel. I do a lot of presentations but found this one (slides with speaker noteshere particularly difficult for three reasons:it's the first time attempting to weave together and present a new story the audience is in a new context for me: Germany + design thinking + politicsI was also asked to do a workshop  with @Susa so it was more difficult to follow up on leads etc.My talk was an attempt at big-picture thinking and pitching a new project to potential clients, funders and strategic partners. Other presentations were more focused on introducing the organisations, presenting their innovation theory/theory of change and their methodology in compact visualisations. What where the reactions?This is what the illustrator doing a graphic recording of the talk got out of it:These are a few comments and tweets:“I thought it was really interesting but it was a bit abstract for me” -  German, female, works on reforming/ restructuring academic institutions“Of all the presentations these two days I found yours was the most interesting, but don’t you come up against a lot of resistance from medical professionals?”- British, male, works at the Young Foundation Very spontanious appearance at #govlabP4T, now listening to @edgeryders - thanks @DanielGoliasch for the tip! #poc21 @openStateBER“How can #tech enable collective intelligence & #collaboration? @edgeryders #govlabP4T #opensource #socialchange ” - @katrin_thinking"In Greece there are 68 clinics serving 10% of population without access to health care, 'illegally' on donations" @Designamyte“Would you be interested in doing consultig for a large environmentalist NGO?” - Austrian?, Male, consultant“Can I have your card, I think I have an idea for you...not this year but next one” - German, 40s, demale, on way out of event❝You only understand dark matter once you engage w/ the system—and learn about administrative hacks.❞  @Martin_JordanImprovements/changes to make ahead of the next presentation:a) introduction to Edgeryders the vision and historyb) a case studyc) in depth presentation of our unique methodologies and tools and how we practically go about applying themd) major practical insights
@danohu came up with a really good suggestion. Is there any way that we could partner up with Wikimedia to get access to the their data on pageviews of medicine- and care-related Wikipedia pages? Ideally, we would get data (based on their log files) as follows:In real time.reporting the page visited and the IP address from which the visit comes.From the IPs it should be possible to count the visits coming from hospitals, which normally use fixed IPs. They might have to be aggregated in such a way that it is not possible for us to identify the individual computer, just the institution.From the IPs it should also be possible to get lat/longThis means you can be a visualization of the world and literally watch humanity look for collective-intelligence built knowledge on medicine and care. It should nicely make the general point that communities already play an important role in care, as well as open the door for all sort of interesting correlations. What do you think?
  On October 15 -16 I will be doing a keynote and running a workshop on behalf of Edgeryders at Politics for Tomorrow, an event which gathers German policymakers and various organisations for which the OpenCare project is of relevance. As this will be the first, but probably not last time, which we will be presenting the work in similar contexts I wanted to reach out to everyone on the team. And ask what you think I should make sure to include in the presentation as well as to ask you to help spread information about our participation in it through your networks. Please help me sharpen the introduction to the talk and share suggestions for the talk and workshop. Here is what I have so far:"What would a system of social and health care look like if it was reflecting how we want to be taken care of, and how we want to take care of each other, in a fair and sustainable future? How would we behave in such a system, how would products and services support those behaviours and how would we go about making them? Which new kinds of understanding are needed and which cultural defaults block them?“During a 20 minute talk (keynote type presentation) I could introduce some new approaches, methodologies and tools applicable to a wide range of political and policy issues that Edgeryders has developed and executed with good results for organisations such as the Council of Europe and the United Nations Development Program.The workshop could present the focal questions within which participants can explore the approaches and tools in more detail (while generating valuable data about a key question relevant for many different stakeholders for different reasons).We would like to leave the event with a very clear understanding of how the project can map onto the current priorities and windows of opportunities open, or opening soon within a number of organisations that could put resources into a project that addresses the focal questions/theme. We would also like to map the gaps in perception between the organisational agendas and how grassroots understand, approach and prioritise the different issues, and this could be done in an open conversation online after the event if we publish some well written blogposts to which those interested can react.Duration Talk: 15-20 minDuration Workshop: 2,5 hNumber of participants for the workshop: 10-14 peopleConfirmed registrations of participants: 75 people quite equally mixedAdministrationCivil SocietyConsulting AgenciesDesignFoundationsGovernmentGovernmental Research OrganizationsResearch InstitutesSocial EnterprisesThink TanksUniversities (Scientists and students)Please take a few minutes to leave a comment below with some suggestions/requests....  
So it is now time to submit a proposal to the Chaos Communication Congress and I think this would be a perfect opportunity to kickstart the conversation in the relevant hacker communities. @Lakomaa @Alberto myself and others in the Edgeryders were there and can verify that in addition to being ALOT of fun, it is pretty much the most economic way to recruit participants and partners for the project if we do a killer talk which includes an invitation to join us at LOTE5.The deadline for submissions is September 30. So, who wants to craft a talk proposal with me ? :))
Abstract: a wealthy couple (he is American, she Italian) bought, equipped and crewed a boat (christened MOAS: Migrants Offshore Aid Station) and is rescuing migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean sea from Africa into Europe (normally Sicily). Many people do this, and tens of thousands have died trying (learn more from a great data journalism enquiry). Since migrants tend to use small boats, too low to have a radar footprint, MOAS locates them with long-range drones. This reminds me of a recent conversation with @trythis. Should we maybe look a little deeper into drone technology? I can think of a number of uses for an EdgeDrone, from documentation to recon in places like Nepal. I wonder what @hexayurt and @Matthias think...

In order to develop consistency across the different Case Study stories collected we use the following shared framework.***FormatEach asking the same set of questions. Each video/audio recording should also contain an addition 5-10 minutes free form conversation by the interviewee. The video/audio should be uploaded into the edgeryders vimeo/soundcloud account, then embedded in a written post summarising the main points from the interview, as well as the author's reflections. QuestionsTell me/us about your project/work?How you got started and current situationWho's involved:  Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skillsets (what are individual team members good at?) Any partnerships?Hypothesis guiding the work: "I believe that to achieve x, we need to do y, through z"What your main objectives are/why you do this?What you enjoy about the work and what you enjoy less?What kinds of tasks do you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, dailyWhat, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?Deeper questions: What should those who really wish to understand the work know? What do you produce/offerProducts or services that you currently produce? How do you go about doing this- what steps are involved? Technologies or processes used?Costs: What expenses are involved?

As an incredibly diverse community, the range of experience and knowledge about building economically sustainability projects amongst members ranges from "where do I even begin" to "I just sold my 3rd company". Also, there are many different interpretations of "economic sustainability" and strategies for achieving it. Moneyless crowdfunding with Makerfox anyone?A recurring topic is one David De Ugarte dove into in this Las Indias's piece on generating revenue through sales. Especially in purpose/value driven contexts, this topic is often controversial and deeply unsettling: [] our “conscience” and the “private logic” will join forces to tell us “we are not good at it”, and that this “it” – selling – is very close to deceiving. But this is false. Most initiatives fail to generate monetary resources not because they don’t manage to develop and deliver a product to the market; they fail because they develop and deliver an experience, service or product that no customers want or need enough to pay for. This is not magic though, it is something that you learn to do. Many of the projects we see popping up on Edgeryders, are collaborative and decentralised initiatives. Perhaps it makes sense to structure a process which everyone can participate in to build economic sustainability into projects in a decentralised way:Identify and document our assumptions  What are our assumptions/hypotheses about how we gratify our clients and or sponsors, who they are, how we will acquire and monetize them?    What are our assumptions/hypotheses about how we serve the needs of our constituency, who they are, as well as how we engage them into becoming more active participants in (and beneficiaries of) our initiatives?  Talk to prospective customers to validate (or invalidate) our assumptions  What problems do they face?  How do they solve them?  What matters to them?  What is a must-have for them?  Identify the risk factors in the opportunity  Are we facing significant technology risks?  Or more of market risk?  How can we test and validate these (starting with the most risky)?  What market testable milestones can we build that would result in sufficient evidence to induce us to pivot or move forward? A proof of concept? A letter of intent?  A prototype?  Create and Test a Minimum Viable Offer  landing page click-through that prove there’s some amount of interest in an experience, product or service;    a time commitment for an in-person meeting to view a demo that shows the customer or funder's problem being resolved;    a resource commitment for a pilot program to test how the experience, product or service or product fits into a particular environment.  Once we have users using our MVO we listen for & tune into the Must-have signal  We listen very carefully to find our must-have signal and articulate it.    We Double-down and strip away the unnecessary> focus on building an experience, service or product that is cherished and supported by everyone who uses it.   Does this make sense to you? Do you want to learn the hands-on-skills involved?I am just about to launch an initiative on behalf of the social enterprise supporting the community. For those who want to learn the skills, this offers an excellent opportunity to learn-by-doing with me.Let me know you are interested by leaving a comment below or emailing me: nadia@edgeryders.eu
A big part of my family is Ethiopian. This is also the main reason I packed my bags and headed off to Addis Ababa... to participate in my beautiful cousins’ weddings.My cousin made clear I was expected to show up in a Habesha Kemis. So on arrival I headed off to Shiro Meda to find a tailor.I liked it so much I ended up getting a second one made.The wedding itself was a ball. With our family being spread across the globe it is rare for so many of us to be in one place at the same time. I really appreciated being able to spend time together in celebration of the most important element of a happy life... love.On the ride to venue where we would dance and try to keep the groom from picking up the bride (yes, literally- tradition), we came into the topic of religion.I was asked about my religious beliefs which struck me as quite an odd question. .... Until I found myself in the middle of a massive Timket (Epiphany) procession in a different part of the country a week later.The same thing happened on numerous occasions in different parts of the country.Religion is a big deal in Ethiopia. So is peace.So Ethiopia is home to oh about 200 ethnic groups and around 80 languages. However diverse I knew the country was, in my mind always was associated with Christianity and Judaism... a long history that began over 2000 years ago. The Hebrew influence and identity is pretty clear when you wander around Gondar and Lalibela, especially if you dig into historical information about different dynasties that ruled and shaped Ethiopia throughout the centuries.So I was surprised to learn just how large a proportion of the population the Muslim minority is. Almost 40 percent, if I’m not mistaken. And that the one Jewish person in the Bet-Israel village is the guy running the museum frequented by tourists on pilgrimages. Where is everyone?! Oh yeah. Pretty much everyone was evacuated to Israel after the massive drought in the 80s.I feel a link to this diaspora, all diaspora really. There is something those of us born with feet in many worlds discover sooner or later. That we are not one or the other, but something else.. ours are third, remix, cultures. Religion is one of those sensitive areas we have to develop mechanisms for navigating.Within my family there are ties to several mega-cities of Africa and Asia where more than half of the world’s 1.3 billion Muslims, and around sixty percent of the world’s 2 billion Christians, live. I was born and have lived in different parts of a Western liberal Europe not sure how to deal with growing tensions between different social groups.Here and there, what we think of as religious and or ethnic conflicts are often intimately tied to underlying conflicts over resources like land or water.Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa and the pressure on land has often been put forward as an important factor in the 1994 genocide. I cannot remember where I heard that in the case of Rwanda there were more intra-ethnic murders than between different ethnic groups... the genocide was partially fueled by the need to free up resources. If memory serves me, they had a system ( currently being reformed) in which all land would be passed on to the first son. Which left a class of landless, disenfranchised young men with no hope of accessing a brighter economic future unless some of that land could be freed up...Israel and Palestine is another example. At the source of this conflict, according to Bo Rothstein, lies mixing of religious rhetoric with what is essentially a fight over assets. He claims that you would create the foundation for lasting peace by focusing on resolving the land/economic disputes with compromises for everyone (Swedish article): http://www.svd.se/…/markavtal-kan-stoppa-valdet_3777014Other examples of legacy injustice include (thanks @Jaycousins ):Egypt - land is divided amongst all children so within a couple of generations everyone has a tiny patch they can't profit from - the result is illegally constructed tower blocks on most of the rare and fertile land in Egypt and a lot of in-family tensions. Likewise In England or any other Western Country, the peasantry had their inheritance stolen out from under them long before the lords and merchants started robbing foreign soil. … There is much to be learned from Ethiopian history about the importance of tackling inequalities in distribution of property and use rights for building lasting peace. Especially in societies where formal property laws and customary property rights arrangements exist in parallel. I believe some of those lessons are also relevant in societies where land rights are secure but ownership of property is highly concentrated.Fixing legacy injustice: Reforming dysfunctional property laws and peace between ethnic groupsJustice is a prerequisite for peace. While the murderous fascist regime known as the Derg got a lot of things wrong, they did push through land right reforms.Prior to the civil war against the old feudal order (Haile Selassie, also known as Ras Tefari), the Muslim population was excluded from being able to access land as they were passed along hereditary lines. So your family had to own land in order for you to have hope of owning land. This was the Ristegna system.Then there was the Gultegna, the nobility, which were granted the right to a fat chunk of the surplus from the land tended by farmers. Basically a rentier class that contributed little or nothing to the development of the country and life of their fellow Ethiopians.Both were upended by the revolution and land redistributed and finally nationalised. Why?One of the persistent calls for social justice in the revolution, also during the Derg period, was “land to the tiller”. All the different interest groups got behind this reform as a fundamental requirement. The military dictators could not back out on this demand as they would loose legitimacy amongst the soldiers, many of whom hailed from the southern parts of the country where the problems of unfair distribution of land was particularly strong for historical reasons.There are still problems, and new ones. Ethiopia is also undeniably doing a lot better than many of the other countries in the region- my impression was that there is a fundamental belief that things are improving, also for those at the wrong end of the power spectrum. Clearly the picture painted depends on who you ask but I could see for myself that e.g. infrastructure is much better in many parts of the country than it used to be.Most of all people are very aware of how fragile and important peace is. The story of a popular revolution co-opted by a military regime that then did its best to murder an entire generation is still fresh in the collective memory. I am reminded of this every time I hear any talk of revolution: the move towards a western style liberal democracy is not one that Ethiopians I spoke to value highly. Rather, it is economic rights and development that seem to be at the heart of their concerns.If we are to achieve peace at home, we need to think about how we tackle legacy injustices against people in different parts of a globalised world. The central pillar is property law and ownership. As Ethiopians learned, it makes sense to start there and not let up till an acceptable solution is reached.There will be losers. However if they are taking up so much space that it threatens the ability of others to survive. Well, they... all of us, may end up losing a lot more than excess capacity.

Welcome! Find here what Edgeryders community management is about, how you could be doing it too and why that's such a cool work.SummaryAboutChecklist: OnboardingChecklist: Nurture conversationsChecklist: Synthesize, Curate, Engage!Checklist: Basic admin work Checklist: Social media outreachNeeded skillsWhat you get out of itCould be your future "job"!More readings On online community management What we are learning about building communities from our members and projectsGet in touchAboutAs of 2014, the Edgeryders community spans over 40 countries and keeps on growing in numbers and diversity. Most of our interaction happens here, on the edgeryders.eu platform, and collaboration is our engine. That’s how we get things done, and to be able to do that effectively there’s a need to constantly inspire, help each other and acknowledge our peers’ efforts. Currently I (@Noemi), with help from @Nadia & @Alberto am doing a number of almost daily things to keep us all informed, engaged and inspired, and encourage healthy behaviors. We tend to call it community management, although I don’t get to “manage” anyone or anything, but I do take responsibility for some processes which I outline below. This is a manual which I hope is useful for any of you thinking of learning key, hands on tools in community building.  Checklist: OnboardingNew Edgeryders sign up and step into the space all the time and risk getting lost unless there’s someone to show them the way! Automated confirmation and welcoming messages rarely do the job for us, so we very much foster a human approach - see the Call a Human block on the homepage. How can you as community manager get in touch with new Edgeryders? You go to their user profile, look for the Contact tab and write them a direct message which goes into their email box (more). Simply say hi and introduce yourself, or tell them about the latest that’s happening; it also helps if you make a connection with a topic they seem to be interested in based on their user profile. This is probably the most routine work in the community management, but highly rewarding when it pays off - people stay involved and enjoy being part of a community of like minded peers.Checklist: Nurture conversationsPaying attention to what others are saying is crucial because it tells the most about who the community members are and what they are interested in. A big part of community management is to nurture conversations: by reading and commenting what Edgeryders are saying, encouraging a diversity of voices, and fostering a culture of respectful, meaningful interaction. NB: My personal opinion is that the risk here is to become an automatic voice. Being a community manager doesn't make us robots or call center operators, we're still biased and opinionated humans. Hence some things get us more excited than others, and we can choose to comment or highlight certain efforts more than others. Same with trolls, you can feed them or not. On empathy: I find being empathetic towards what other people are saying is key in developing good relationships in general, and in communities. This means prioritizing what they are feeling and cultivating a behavior by which we are wary of making any sort of assumptions about why they say certain things (read more).Many community members share common interests and although the platform is designed to increase serendipitous encounters, they can still miss each other. The good thing to do is, whenever you know people are doing similar things, invite them into conversations whenever key content could be interesting for them, or directly introduce them to each other on twitter, facebook etc. As a community manager, you'll get to know most of people's social handles, so this will come easy to you.Checklist: Synthesize, Curate, Engage!I don’t know if this is part of the professional community manager’s job, but Edgeryders is entirely volunteer driven and the more we teach ourselves to work with content aka communicate properly, community managers and not only, the better! Sharing information and latest about what Edgeryders are doing is key, and it can be done mostly through periodic blog posts or platform posts in various relevant groups, and through our mailing list and social media.. Communicating and articulating thoughts in writing and also in public/for larger audiences is key to: Conveying our values, our work, our successes: eg through curation “a form of pattern recognition – pieces of information or insight which over time amount to an implicit point of view” – says one of my favourite writers Maria Popova Tip: never assume everybody follows what’s happening in the community. We need to re-package & summarize content all the time, even if it may seem obsolete.Gathering and making use of relevant resources online: an additional challenge is to communicate in an engaging style, one that prompts responses and enthusiasm among fellow Edgeryders and triggers collaboration.Tip: the simplest structure when writing for engagement can be: a. What is the context or perspective from which you are writing the post? b. What challenge are you trying to solve/ what do you intend to achieve with the post? c. What are the steps to get started? d. Call to action: what do you want those reading the post to do? What action should they take in order to support you?Checklist: Basic admin workTo be more effective as an online community managers we all need to use our web platform as efficient as possible, meaning we can learn to make use of functionalities which ease the process of getting in touch with others and getting information or updates across. This goes beyond becoming a proficient platform user (by pinging Edgeryders, creating tasks and other things in the user’s manual), and also involves putting up blocks, content editing & clean up when needed. If you become an Edgeryders community manager, we’ll get you admin powers and make sure someone in the developers’ team can give you a crash course in deploying basic Drupal platform features.SPOTLIGHT: EdgesenseEdgesense is our own tool for social network analysis making it easier to detect emergent social dynamics. It is essentially a dashboard allowing community managers and anyone interested to monitor network growth in terms of number of users (nodes), relationships (edges) and specialized subcommunities (modularity) over time. You can start by testing it with the interactive tutorial, read: crash course in network analysis and concepts.Edgesense has been initiated by @Alberto & the Wikitalia team under CATALYST.Read more about it in its own platform group here and about the techs behind it on GitHub. The Edgeryders network on the 8th of July, 2014Checklist: Social media outreachAgain, this is not entirely relevant to community management, but it is useful to learn especially when working with limited resources and when almost everyone involved in maintaining the ER infrastructure needs to step in and help cover the need. It involves basic usage of personal (and optionally official ER channels) facebook, twitter and other social media and turning them into community engagement channels: posting relevant updates especially focused on what’s happening with the community, what people are working on and what individual Edgeryders have achieved lately! Highlighting members' efforts is an advice I've been given a lot (thanks Dorotea!) and we need to get ever better at acknowledging individual efforts. Luckily, a Social Media team is here to help, but not surprisingly, this too needs (re)activation and constant inspiration :)Needed skillsA genuinely friendly attitude and empathy (see above): that’s pretty much all you need to get started in community management. The rest can be learned and you’d be surprised of how intuitive it all is. We're all social beings after all.What you get out of itSome of the perks of volunteering to do Edgeryders community management are the following:You become an expert in online communities and really understand the social dynamics behind them: put that on your resume or on LinkedIn. Plus, Edgeryders the social enterprise or fellow community members can give you a recommendation!By developing interpersonal relationships with others and evolving into a highly respected member in the community you get to grow your own social capital and a global networkYou get to be an empowered online platform user & learn basic Drupal tweaks (beginner level, yet it feels empowering!), but most importantly, you become proficient in online collaboration: a much needed skill in the times we're living.Could be your future "job"!Community management is definitely among the buzz words in the labour market today, alongside other interesting and similar "jobs" (should we still be interested to think in terms of jobs):Network weaver: is someone who is aware of the networks around them and explicitly works to make them healthier. They do this by helping people identify their interests and challenges, connecting people strategically where there’s potential for mutual benefit, and serving as a catalyst for self-organizing groups.

(full text here)The art of hosting good online conversations (Originally published, 1998)by Howard RheingoldA HOST IS…A host is like a host at a party. You don’t automatically throw a great party by hiring a room and buying some beer. Someone needs to invite an interesting mix of people, greet people at the door, make introductions, start conversations, avert fisticuffs, encourage people to let their hair down and entertain each other.A host is also an authority. The host is the person who enforces whatever rules there may be, and will therefore be seen by many as a species of law enforcement officer.A host is also an exemplar. Good hosts model the behavior they want others to emulate: read carefully and post entertainingly, informatively, and economically, acknowledge other people by name, assume good will, assert trust until convinced otherwise , add knowledge, offer help , be slow to anger, apologize when wrong, politely ask for clarification, exercise patience when your temper flares.A host is also a cybrarian. Good hosts nurture the community memory, pointing newcomers to archives, providing links to related conversations, past and present, hunting down resources to add to the collective pool of knowledge — and teaching others to do it. Well performed voluntary cybrarianship is contagious.A host can be a character in the show, but the show is collaborative improvisation, with the audience onstage.All hosts are members of a community of hosts. You can’t host communities without communities of hosts.The article in full can be read here.An Abecedarium For Community Management, by Meg PickardSourceAlso see:The Virtual Community, by Howard RheingoldThe Network Weaver Handbook by June HolleyAdvanced Social Sciences for Community Builders, Ning talk Noemi’s Pinterest board on Communities & StorytellingWhat we are learning about building communities from our members and projectsAn attempt to gather here important reflections from the life of our community.Building a shared vision of Edgeryders, results of a community survey, end of 2013Quakes create movements, but can we?, reflections of building an online community of alternative leaders in post-earthquake Nepal, 2015Spot the Future Bucharest, an open report after two months of online/offline community building in Romania, 2015On compensating community members' efforts, a discussion about using MakerFox for network bartersContribute to developing an Edgeryders healthy communication culture, a wiki you are most welcome to contribute to!Get in touchIf you want to learn more about online community building and want to help Edgeryders thrive, get in touch.

This is a runthrough of what we are going to do in the resilience session (join here). Executive summary: we will try to design a health care system that would work in a financial meltdown scenario, which could happen just three days after the conference in parts of Europe depending on Sunday's elections in Greece. You will rewire health care to make it low-cost, decentralized and peer-to-peer as much as possible. You will be able to count on Lucas's knowledge of health care systems and on Ben and Gaia's network analysis skills. Let's do it!Health systems are made of people who have knowledge and work through procedures. They use buildings with machinery that uses consumables and energy. The scenario is that of a financial meltdown. Even if there’s no money, parts of the system stay in place (people, buildings, machinery, knowledge and many procedures). But some things may become scarce (supplies of consumables and fuel) or will have to change (many procedures).  The overall suggestion is we could look at networks for help. Networks could be activated (or created) in order to look at:Supplies (energy, consumables): prioritise transport, synthesise some medication locally, repurpose existing physical resources, etc.Procedures: networks look at prioritary aims and adapt procedures: solve things at primary care level if hospital or ambulances fail, boil germs if there’s no electricity, etc.Personally I’ve been looking at Vinay Gupta’s Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps (SCIM) model for a pandemic, which would be a different scenario.The model is simply a spreadsheet of “needs” x “levels”.One example of “need” is food, and it’s solved at different “levels”; in my personal case, food is grown internationally and brought to me via international-national-local transport. So, if international markets or transport break, I’d have to look elsewhere or grow food locally. (Poor farmers grow their food locally, and use no transport. In a bad-weather crisis, they need international supplies delivered to them. Or they move.)Vinay’s model includes “too hot, too cold, hunger, thirst, disease and injury” (for the individual), “communication, transport, workplace and resource-sharing” (for groups), and up to a total of 18 items for organisations and nation-states.If the health system is a big organisation (really, a network of many organisations), then we want to look at more specific needs, which are covered by existing provision-systems, and if those provision-systems break then we need to look at alternatives (because needs stay with us!).In health systems, the basic needs of the individual (shelter/clothes, water, food) and groups (communications, transport) are still there.Specialised needs include: "sterilisation", "main groups of meds" (anesthetics, painkillers, insulin, cancerkillers, etc), "communications" (need can be produced by good protocols for local action), etc. Not a comprehensive list, but the rest can be inferred by analogy.If the electric grid fails, "sterilisation" can still be done with generators or boiling. If medicine markets fail, we’d be looking at making them locally if we can, etc.Here’s how I'd suggest we approach the 2.5 hour session:In 15 minutes (or less) I’d briefly explain how (I think) healthcare works using the SCIM model, and together we’d focus on what breaks in our scenario.In 15 minutes, our network experts would look at it from the “network” point of view. I can imagine some things (each person has contact with others within the system), but not others. Together we can flesh it out, learn and contribute to the solutions, so do come!We can then make groups of 3-4 people for each area. Each area would pose a specific subchallenge, and each group would be expected to come up with workable ideas. (If there are many areas, a group might want to do more than one area if they work really fast.)AREAS: What are the areas? A hyper-complex system such as “health” can be split up in many different ways. The general focus is “we have people and buildings and knowledge, but supplies may be costly or unavailable”. We think the following might work as “sub-focus areas” for our creative thinking:Peer-to-peer diagnosis and treatment. (Even diagnosis of epidemics?)Low-cost pharmaceutical products: medicines, prosthetics, etc. (Include water filters, compost toilets, hand washing in case there’s a general break-down and not just health-care is affected?)Prevention through life-style changes: can we help each other live healthier lives and enjoy the process?Cooperative help when there’s need for transport (or this is part of #1).Can you bring expertise to one or more of these areas? Can you suggest more areas? Do you have specific ideas we shouldn’t have to re-think? WORKABLE IDEAS: Coming up with workable ideas would be done by looking at two aspects: What are the networks involved: what people are closest to the problem? who provides the services now? who could provide some alternatives?How would the sub-focus needs be "solved": reinforce the present system if possible, substitute some elements, do a full redesign of the provision system, change some protocols, etc. Here, creative thinking can be applied to the fullest. If you’re a permaculturist, please apply permacultural design principles such as “relative location for mutual service”, etc.
A couple of days ago we had a good conversation in our open-hardware local group.Our group has more than 80 members, but in different islands so it's never a large group. We grew out of the local linux user group, and so far we've done the usual: cooperatively buy a 3D printer and then start printint parts for the offspring (more 3D printers!), build a couple of small hexayurt models (not just me, but two others, yay!), created an inexpensive 3D printer where the 3D movement is done using very inexpensive off-the-shelf "guides for drawers" ("guías para cajones" in Spanish), and a platform on wheels with a battery and a webcam to be used as a farm robot.In that environment, creativity just happens, and we're thinking we should crowdsource the building of a machine to cut metal pieces and build all sorts of things. (For those into details, opensourceecology.org's CNC torch table.)In a nutshell, I think technology needs to be open, appropriate and agile. In Spanish, that's "abierta, apropiada & ágil", which gives us a nice AAA or A³."Open" means you really own what you bought or built. At the very least, you can unscrew it to replace broken parts etc. "Appropriate" means you use local materials when available (except metals which you'll then use for a thousand years, or if you want to house a million in Haiti, in which - if that's what you want to do - you might consider importing several million panels of plywood, so it really depends), and certainly you want to make it cold-resistent in Helsinki, and ant-resistent in the jungle.Now, "agile". We need to look at several levels of "agile". For each project, modularity lets people work in parallel: you do the wheels and I do the battery and that other group works on the webcam. As a meta-level, we're hoping networks of hackerspaces will welcome us as soon as we have some room to set up a hackerspace ourselves.I'm into resilience. I think these groups and networks are a great resource (among others) in any European society. They could use some help and attention.Now, I know no technofix will be enough. We're still a culture that has a history of converting natural resources into toxic waste, and even if we change our ways a lot, the (metaphorical) ex-smoker will still have (metaphorical) damaged lungs.
Last year I read the blog of Doug Rushkoff  “Are jobs obsolete?”. And it really made me think about our approach to employment. I don’t think there is any political party who doesn’t have a focus on reducing unemployment in these times.  Rushkoff’s daring question however is:“I am afraid to even ask this, but since when is unemployment really a problem? I understand we all want paychecks -- or at least money. We want food, shelter, clothing, and all the things that money buys us. But do we all really want jobs?”If you look at the question more thoroughly you can also state that we even don’t want to have money. We do want to have food, sheltering and all other kind of stuff.  Rushkoff elaborates on this issue too. I am curious what you think of Rushkoff’s blog and if you have ideas about how to build a society around something else than employment.Maybe one of the answers could be the so called ‘basic income’ for every citizen.  We had some discussions in the Netherlands about that 20 years ago. Nowadays I don’t hear a lot about it. Does anyone know about countries where the basic income for every citizen has been successful implemented?
29 years living in the bigger county of Portugal - Odemira...29 years living in the countryside...growing up and seeing my grandparents, my parents, my neighbours making their farming...Yes, where i live having even a little farm is a good way to run a little bit of crisis because in this way we don't have to buy every food in supermarket (in big cities people have to buy everything).Here my parents plant potatoes...my grandparents plant beans...my neighbour plants for example peas and then all of us have everything of this to eat. We share a lot. "if i have a lot i can give a little to you and you give me a little of what you plant" and like my father says "this is like in the old times".Personally I don't meet any project of "community farming" but close to where i live i saw a project where City Hall has a big ground and gives all the conditions (for example water ) so that who wants can sow what they want. In my opinion this is a very good kind of project because gives to people some tools to fight the crisis with their own work and provides new relations between people.   
For 6 years I have been involved with Transition Stroud - one of over 300 initiatives globally attempting to deal with the issues of climate change, peak oil and economic turmoil through practical local projects and community-building. I am now one of 12 Directors of the Limited Company we set up to run various projects, and network the multitude of other organisations working locally on these and related issues. In some ways, I feel like I am building my personal resilience - I am a qualified cycle mechanic (Cytek Level 1, which is a basic qualification, since you ask, but enough to get me by on my bike and help others), I cycle for almost all the journeys I make (thus am much less affected than most, at least directly, when oil prices spike), I grow some of my own food on an Allotment (in England, small patches of land are rented to people for small sums of money by local authorities), and I have a good network of friends and acquaintances in my street and local town who I know will all pull together to help each other when the need arises. But, while I'm developing my academic and work skills by studying for a PhD (on the *resilience* of certain organisations), beginning to work as a Lecturer, and volunteering on all manner of projects, I am extremely uncertain about the future, and about how our community might cope in the long-term following significant shocks. Though I feel like I have a good understanding of what the term 'resilience' means in everyday speech, and in various academic fields, I am less certain what it looks like in practice - at least, I am unsure what a community or society truly resilient to the enormous shocks we face in the future would look like.In particular, I am concerned about producing enough food locally (not reliant on long-distance transport), and about employment - and the effects increased transportation costs have on the ability of people to travel to work.People often cite my hometown - Stroud, Gloucestershire - as a frontrunner in the development of a resilient and sustainable local economy. But it still feels like we have a long way to go!Yes, we have a very successful weekly Farmers' Market - with produce largely from within a 50 mile radius of the town, and a couple of Community Supported Agriculture projects, not to mention several full allotment sites (with long waiting lists), and a town council interested in creating more. But our local area also falls within the food footprint of bigger settlements nearby - such as Gloucester and Bristol. How are we going to feed all these people in a world where yields and transportation of food is dramatically affected by peak oil and climate change?Yes, we have a 'Car Club' where people share 4 communal vehicles, so they do not have to own their own car but have access to one. And we have some good train connections - to the nearest large town and to London, and a few decent bus services. But most bus services are terrible - especially for the many isolated rural settlements that make up our district, and unattractive to people. Public transport is prohibitively expensive, and provision for cyclists is poor (not to mention the hills!). There has been a lot of work and campaigning on improving infrastructure for cycling, but little action by local authorities. In Transition Stroud, we are looking into electric bike provision, and working out how we can best mobilise and put pressure on local authorities - but transport is a national policy issue, with provision privatised to large companies. How can we influence them? Or can we take this provision back into public ownership?There is an ongoing debate locally about housing - mainly the opposition to construction in the countryside dominates media coverage, but discussion of the high prices of housing, the increasing difficulty young people have in finding accomodation in the places they grew up, is never far behind. Is there a solution to this conundrum that can also address the need for new build housing to be as energy efficient and environmentally sound as possible? Following my research on UK Building Societies (mutuals - cooperatives owned by their consumers - which were once the dominant mortgage lenders in the UK, and before that helped people to pool funds to build homes), I am involved in the tentative beginnings of a 'Stroud REbuilding Society' - the aim being to use a cooperative model to enable young people to access affordable, green, housing.With others in Transition Stroud, I have been debating the difference between creating new 'sustainable enterprises' and creating resilient economies where we can reduce our reliance on money and hence on wage-labour, making life easier for the unemployed and those on low incomes, and enabling volunteering. We have a local currency (which can only circulate in the local town, and loses value over time so cannot be hoarded), and a TimeBank (where each hour of work donated is equal to another hour requested), and a good culture of voluntary groups and small enterprises. But national and local government cuts, and increased competition for funding is making much of this work considerably more difficult. We need to figure out how to build a new economy as the old one falls apart fast!Maybe I am too pessimistic, and too focussed on the problems, and questions, than on the solutions. To counter this I will mention the events we have coming up:In July we have organised four days of 'Edible Open Gardens', where 40 productive gardens, allotments and orchards will be open to the public, showcasing their growing methods and providing workshops from basic to advanced techniques (starting out and composting to wildlife gardening and soil micro-organisms). See here: http://www.transitionstroud.org/wpedibleopengardens/. I'll bring some of the pamphlets we've made to advertise the weekend to the conference.In September, we are running our 5th annual 'Open Eco-Renovated Homes' weekend, you can see videos and more from previous years here: http://www.stroudopenhomes.org.uk/. I'll bring some printed material from previous years of this event too, if I can find it!We're also running a series of films - 'Debtocracy' and shorts on the Greek crisis and community responses, and 'Just Do It!', a film about UK climate activists.There's lots more too, but I guess it will have to wait for the conference. If any of the above has interested you, please comment below and I can elaborate.
There are lots of reasons to support Vinay Gupta's thesis that Europe is on the brink of a kind of war. His thesis is that at some stage the austerity measures being imposed for ideological reasons on Greece (and other countries in Europe - Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland) will result in some kind of revolutionary backlash where property will be seized. The fact that much of this property is owned by international institutions will result in major crises and consequent disruption of food supply chains and other infrastructure. There are several responses to this:1. It is already happening. Fundamentally the austerity measures are resulting in property seizure by international agencies (banks, TNCs) of personal or national assets (cf. for example the privatisation programme imposed on Greece). The privatisation of the NHS in the UK is another front where this war is occurring in the UK - what this means is that gradually that hip-replacement Vinay mentions no longer becomes an automatic right but is initially rationed and then eventually needs to be paid for. The absence of funds is making living in remote Greek islands extremely precarious if you happen to have an accident or life threatening illness. This process of conquest and colonisation by (relatively) faceless forces is no different than the earlier incarnations of colonialism whether we look at the spread of the East India Company or the colonisation of Egypt by the UK in the second half of the 19th century. The major difference today is the rather impressive propaganda whereby people are given the impression that "there is no alternative" (TINA). There always are alternatives at every stage in the unfolding of a war. The leader of Greece's SARIZA party, Tsipras, understands this when he says the conflict is between capital and people, and in the same breath states that it is not inevitable that Greece either imposes an austerity package or is kicked out of the Eurozone. His statements show far greater sophistication and understanding of reality than the current statements emanating from Angela Merkel. 2. It may not happen. One of the interesting but little understood achievements of the European Union is the gradual and subtle interweaving of Europeans at multiple levels. Over 1m UK citizens live (mostly in retirement in Spain). The mayor of Majorca is (or was until recently) a German citizen. Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens work in other EU countries. Universities and companies around the EU employ a multiplicity of international staff especially from other EU regions. There are 300,000 French citizens living in London, but there are an equal number of Greeks living there (proportionately a far greater percentage), let alone Spanish, Portugese and Irish. One question today is what the proportions are of the various social groups who are other Europeans. In the 19th century, a large proportion of 'navies' (those who dug the canals and built the railways) were Irish, but few bankers in the City of London were Irish. Today the proportion of foreign staff at all levels in society has increased enormously.  A friend of mine is a Portugese computer scientist working for a top insurance company in Zurich. His girlfriend is French-speaking Swiss. They speak English together. This is typical scenario today, more unusual in earlier centuries where freedom of movement of labour did not exist to that extent either for legal reasons or for lack of education and opportunity. So the question arises whether the level of integration I am pointing to here can act as a brake on the tendency towards war. It certainly makes nonsense of national parties, national separatism. On the other hand, one of the reasons the Greeks are torn about the Euro in spite of the austerity is the fear of losing the free movement of labour that membership of the EC provided. This fear at present is unfounded as there are other non-Eurozone members of the EC - however, in the long term it may make sense. My mother (aged 74) recommends that people should live where they have a passport because she has seen enough to know the dangers of living somewhere where one is by any criterion 'foreign'. 3. It does not need to happen. Vinay has argued time and again that the final arbiter of power is the nation state, with its laws and military power. If Tsipras is right that the real war is between capital and the people, and Vinay is right that the power lies with the nation state, then if Greece were to revolt and the nation state's power go into the hands of a revolutionary force then what part could capital play here? Three things to remember: First, nations have renationalised their resources frequently and often without serious negative consequences to their economic position (cf. Argentina renationalising its oil company, or Bolivia's Morales nationalising the natural gas reserves). Capital screams, everyone is upset, and then they move on. These are the rules of the game and if a nation choses to change them they usually have the right to do so if they are in a strong enough position. Second, as Tsipras says, the problem lies as much with the lenders as with the borrowers. Greece is in a much stronger position than public discourse allows. It has already defaulted in effect so the imposition of the austerity is an ideological imposition independant of the reality of financial default. Third, there is an irony that over the years Greece has been one of the largest arms importers in the world, spending more as a proportion of GDP than any other EU country. There is no present day need for this except to keep French, German and UK arms manufacturers happy. The side effect of this is that if Greece does choose to follow an independant path it is in a better position to do so than almost any other mediterranean country. But this is not the sort of war Vinay speaks about - he speaks of an undeclared war of infrastructure meltdown. Nonetheless the point here is that power is not all in the hands of the EC or the neo-colonialist/neo-liberals. 4. Vinay's focus on the cities is important. Countries like Greece have kept strong ties to the countryside. Most Greek families have a 'second home' in the village, and it is to this village that many are returning. Ties have been kept with the relatives in the village supplying olive oil, and other basics. There are enormous problems with regard to the ability of Greek villages to feed themselves, but there is also huge potential. The poorer people are in the mediterranean societies the less impacted they are by the austerity measures, they more 'off-grid' they are in practice. It would interesting to find out whether just as the European banks have disengaged over the past 2-3 years from financially dangerous investments in the EC periphery, whether there has been a corresponding disengagement at an infrastructure level of the local populations, a re-engagment with the family ties which have always acted as the final, most essential infrastructure in times of crisis. If you can flee the city and be received by your cousins in the country, then the situation is a lot less bad than if you are an alienated individual with no effective ties to a (first life) social network. This leads to the natural question as to what role can technology, especially social networks and our networked world, play in reducing the alienation of cities and providing alternative succour as the hard infrastructure collapses. Will our Facebook friends receive us, house us, feed us, when the shit hits the fan? Will we be able to find them in first life if all we know is their second life handle, when the lights go down? 5. While there has been an immense growth of international organisation in many areas (NGOs e.g. Greenpeace, TNCs e.g. Vodaphone, GM, Tata), there has been a dearth of overtly international political movements since the collapse of communism. In the context of Tsipras' remarks, we need transnational, pan-european political and social movements. We have the structural underpinnings - in the form of a common language (English dominates the EC) and technologies (social media, etc.). We have the political context in that it has become more and more clear that decisions are no longer made by our national governments for a whole range of issues. We have a clear democratic deficit (the weakness of the European parliament is well known). All this augurs well for a revolution in political action which crosses international boundaries and co-ordinates its activities. There are three movements which have to varying degrees expressed this: the Greens and more recently the Pirate Party and the Occupy Movement. Thus while the time may be ripe for revolutions, wars and other such unpleasantnesses, it may also be a opportunity for political maturity across the board, across social classes and national divides. This may sound somewhat utopian but looking at the realities of today in Europe we could just as easily tip into war (real hard war) as we could into creating trans-national political organisation with specific demands and legislative agendas. Here I suspect we come up against a certain degree of defeatism about the possibility of such political movements. The EC is continuously in danger of tipping into oligarchy (of some form). There is an opportunity to push back and revitalise democracy across the board. 6. The core advice Vinay has given on numerous occasions remains valid: Stock up with food and water so as to be able to survive a lengthy breakdown in services. We can add to that a. ensure you are living in a country whose passport you possess; b. build your first life social network to maximum, c. revitalise the connections with the cousins who grow tomatoes.
While I'm writing this new post the italian earth still trembles...!!!In the Emilia Romagna Region, in the nordth of the Italy, are very bad moments. Continuous tremors terrorize all the people and all the Italy are trying to help this piece of land. But the question is: "how they are trying to help them?!"I'm an expert of this situation, because as a voluntary I did the Molise earthquake and Abruzzo eartquake and I saw many problemes during this moments and I would to speak here and in the conference in june (if is possible... :D) to think a way to emprove the situation during this bad moment...I understand about my experience that one problem of the people is that they lose all the comunication with the rest of the word. many people try to call the friends and parents immediatly after the first tremor and so all the lines are overload. Then after two or three hours all the mobile are dead and so everything need to recharge the mobile and so they need of the electrician.Then many people call and ask all and nothing because at the beggining there is a lot of panic and confusion.... who ask an house, who ask a bed, who ask to enter own house, who ask where they should to go, who ask to call, who ask where are theyr parents, who ask to eat, who ask the sheets, who ask dress, who ask to speak with the major, who ask to speak with theadministration, the firefighters and so and so... and all the people have many problems!So I thoughtk that the priority is the possibility to call in every time! And so I thought to built a page or a forum but inside the website of the city and this space start oly when there are an emergency. This page could have many pages as the page of the comunications (major, Protezione Civile, doctors, policy, fireflighters, and so and so...), the page to write help about the house, the people, dress, eat and so and so. It will be to have a page with the progects or the events to help. To built a task force to help to rebuilt...Thus my idea was to think a instrument useful to help the cityzens, the administraction, the protezione civile, law enforcement, the firefighters after 5 minuts of the eartquake and also after months of the event,Many time, after 5 days of the terrible moments, all forget the situation and they abandon these lands... and so la possibility to have every time a site where to work continuosly to help the people for me it will be very right....These is only a my idea and if someone would to speak, for me it's ok.
As the current economic crisis hits a number of European countries, Polypolis social game uses a playful manner to train/educate city inhabitants to cope ‘in common’ with issues that affect their life’s resources. The Polypolis game was initially conceived as a testing ground for SARCHA’s “CCR: CityCommonResource (2010-2011)” research theme pilot study http://sites.google.com/site/ccrpkpgerani2010/.In the rapidly deteriorating Athens centre, players are assigned life-roles; immersed in an urban environment of economic recession, illegality, city-phobia, rising violence and human desperation, the Athenians enter into an agonising and agonistic struggle to reset the city’s human, physical and natural resources. The players keep reflecting and acting upon "real" city conditions, and watch the outcome of their decisions unfold on the game board.Reversing Monopoly, the role-playing social game Polypolis entails negotiations among 4 groups of players that strive to resolve complex issues. The four groups of players are:1. Investors. Sub-groups: bankers, private investors, institutions/organisations, international corporations, real-estate. 2. Land/property owners. Sub-groups: big-scale ownership, small-scale ownership (local owners), small-scale ownership (owners from other areas).3. Shop/small-scale manufacture owners. Sub-groups: Greeks, Chinese, Pakistani, Greek small-scale manufacture owners, arts & crafts4. Unemployed. Sub-groups: homeless, immigrants, drug-users, skilled ex-employeesThe winner: The group that proves the ability to resolve problems by discussion, negotiation and collaboration, managing the city resources and creating an appropriate, good quality and viable proposal for tackling the complex problems and contributing to the development of the Gerani area.SARCHA has started to develop local adaptations of the Polypolis such as the ones in Rome and in Thessaloniki. The next big event is in London in June as part of the London Festival of Architecture. In an 2 hour game players will become Athenians and experience a city in crisis.For more information about Polypolis Athens in London you can visit www.polypolis.sarcha.gr 
In the last few years a whole slice of the italian population, went from being invisible and slightly uncool, to being a dynamic nationwide movement!A movement able to challenge current citizeship laws, challenge common stereotypes and cultural perceptions of who we are, and most importantly, able to make people feel like they're part of an "us" instead of a "them".I was able to join this network born in Rome in it's early stages, and create the milanese G2 group with some other people.This below, is who we are and how we work.Rete G2 - Seconde Generazioni (Rete means network in italian)Rete G2 - Seconde Generazioni is a National organization founded by daughters and sons of immigrants and refugees born and/or raised in Italy.Rete G2 is a network of people with different backgrounds and professional skills, whose origins are from Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.Each one of the members of this network defines himself/herself not as an immigrant but as an italian kid of an immigrant, even though by law they are not recognised italian citizenship.Those who were born on italian soil have the chance to obtain citizeship when they reach 18 years of age, until then they are considered as nationals of their country of origin.Such a group decided to work together on two fundamental points:1. Italian citizenship issues on denied rights to the second generation2. Identity as a form of gathering of different cultures.Motivations:The motivations behind the creation of the network include sharing experiences, discussing common issues and trying to find solutions to problems regarding legal status, documentation, citizenship, but also discussing cultural and ethnic self representations and how users feel about their multiple identities in everyday life.The network has grown since it's creation in 2005, it is now recognised by media other organizations and institutions (such as the Italian Ministry for Internal Affairs and Welfare polical parties of every side and even the italian president who recently mentioned and thanked Rete G2 for it's extesive work on this important subject) and is involved in diverse immigration and integration debates.The website include a blog and a forum which is quite active, and the network is also present on social networks such as Facebook, twitter, where they have more than 2,538 members.Journalist and uni students use the network as a source of information.Finally, it is important to point out that the group insists on the network’s management being democratic, horizontal, leaderless, politically neutral and uses the website to enhance this thinking.Innovation and creativity:This is a one of a kind project (first in Italy), a grassroots initiative created to raise awareness, and draw the attention to challenges for future generations. It focuses on daughters and sons of immigrants and attempts to raise their social capital by actively using social computing, and uses the most up-to-date communication tools (wikis, blogs, social networks, etc) to reach its audience. It fights for citizenship rights and other fundamental rights and draws challenges for future generations.It uses cultural instruments like music (compilation "Straniero a chi?" ), books, video spot, National Radio broadcasting "OndeG2", fotoromanzo (stories told in pictures), photo exhibitions and websites etc to accompany and sustain the activity and the initiative of Rete G2 in order to obtain a maximum result and thus realize its objective and mission.Also very important focus for Rete G2 is the work with schools, both with students and teachers alike on identity, diversity and citizenship rights.Sustainability:The original and horizontal way of managing the network allows the project to keep going, and promotes its sustainability. Just as an example, the Sportello Legale online (opened 1st of March 2011) which is promoted by G2 in collaboration with ASGI and Save the Children, is funded by the Department of Equal Opportunities and National Office for Racial Discrimination (UNAR) due to its positive action.--Medhin☮www.medhinpaolos.comwww.secondegenerazioni.it 
How William of Orange didn't succeed in his claim for freedom of religion and how that affected the life of my family. Writing about my family is probably a good start for a first mission and introduction.  I am born in 1968 in the East of the Netherlands, grew up in a midsized town and I have three elder brothers and one twin sister.But let me first tell more about my parents. They also grew up in the East of the Netherlands, in two separate small villages. Both were born in 1936 as the younger ones in large Catholic families. My father has in total thirteen brothers and sisters, my mother has eight. So we are speaking of 23 people, including my parents. All of them, except for one uncle who was suffering from mental illnesses and stayed single, married with a Catholic partner.  Only one of them divorced, all the other marriages have sustained until today.For my parents and their brother & sisters it was out of the question to marry a person who was not Catholic. However, I never got the idea that my parents were raised in a very strict manner. It could be that some uncles or aunts fell in love with a boy or girl they weren’t allowed to marry but I have never heard anything that indicates that these things happened. Somehow, the idea that you could only marry a person with the same religious background was incorporated as a normal fact of life in my family.When I was born, secularisation and the removal of traditional religious and socio-political barriers in the Netherlands were well on their way. I still was baptized, sent to a Catholic primary school, but religion was no longer part of the lives of my parents. By the time I was old enough to date with boys, there were absolute no issues about religious backgrounds.In 1986 I went to Amsterdam to study, among others, Political Science. And shortly after that I started to live together with the guy I would marry in 1995. Before our marriage we already bought our first house (1992) en in 1997 we started to build our second house. In 1998 our first daughter was born, followed by a second daughter in 2000. In 1995 I was appointed as CFO of a small retail bank, which my parents considered as quite a achievement as they themselves were blue collar workers with no more than primary education.For me however, being 37 years old, it was the moment where I really started thinking about my life. I outgrew my parents in terms of education and career but did I really do what I wanted to do. What did I do with the ideas I had when starting to study political science? And what about my marriage, was I really living the life I wanted or was it just a matter of doing the things I ought to do, influenced by societal conventions.Two years later I was divorced, gave up my job as a CFO and headed back to Amsterdam. I was totally okay with the idea of being single and when thinking about a new relationship, I always imagined that it would be with a male approximately  the same age I was and with a regular career. But totally out of the blue I fell in love with a 12 year young woman, still studying at the university.  She had been in love with women before. For me it was a big surprise to be in love with a woman. But I quickly got used to the idea. I also had to get used to the idea of having a relationship with someone so much younger. The thing that puzzled me most however, was the idea of how ñshe as a young woman could fell in love with me, a middle aged woman.Suddenly the idea struck me that I unconsciously considered myself as an acceptable partner for a middle age male but not acceptable for a younger female. That was really funny, because in any relationship I would be the same person. And then I realized how preconditioned we are in any choice we make.I am married to her now, she gave birth to our son in 2011. And my daughters are very happy with my partner and their little brother. And my family, including all those highly aged uncles and aunts are totally fine with my family situation. It is amazing what has changed in the past 40 years. People can adapt very easily is my personal experience. But we have to tell stories like this to people to make them realize what is possible. This is very importantThat brings me to one last story I want to tell in this mission. I always had the idea that in the 16th century, when The Reformation took place, that people were highly religious. And that the barriers between the Catholic and the Protestant communities which were so profound  in the lives of my parents was a consequence of choices made by those communities themselves. I found out that most people in the 16th century, by the time all the battles were settled, were really very indifferent about religion.This was also the case for the new regents who were going to govern the Dutch Republic from the year 1581 and further on. Especially their leader, William of Orange, was very tolerant about religion. However he couldn’t convince his fellows to build a society with total freedom of religion and without any government interference in this domain. The dominant view at the time was that people could only by governed by having a dominant state religion and the fear for God as the ultimate instrument to let people behave in a way that was good for society. So the regents made an agreement that, whatever their personal beliefs were, they would act as if they were really very religious and in favour of the Protestant religion. After some years fiction became reality and people took their religion very serious.  And almost 400 years later people were still marrying only within their own religious community.Again, the stories we tell each other are very important. If our dominant view is that people are selfish, most people will behave selfish. But in our lives we see so many examples of people behaving otherwise. Especially now this is happening; due to internet and new technologies we see many new forms of voluntary cooperation among people. We have to emphasize this new form of cooperation. (And if you want to read more about it, I recommend Yochai Benkler’s latest books.)
So, in the UK the Coalition Government (Conservatives and Liberals, two sides of the three-sided party system of neoliberal politics and economics that dominates here) has just passed a piece of legislation called the Health and Social Care Act (previously the Health and Social Care Bill - it becomes an Act when it passes).This legislation is widely seen as an attack on the socialised system of health (and social) care in the Country by those on the Left (and others!). Furthermore, it is seen as an attack on the principle of access to Healthcare for All.Can we think of health(and social)care as a commons? How can we stop the value created by health and social care workers being sucked away into the pockets of the shareholders in multinational (frequently tax-dodging) companies?Furthermore, at another level, what will healthcare look like in the midst of the environmental crises of climate change and declining supplies of resources our society is dependent on (specifically oil, but there are others)?This research project is not just about abstract theoretical questions, but about looking at the social movements and alternative forms of health and social care delivery that exist across Europe, the world, and indeed across time - what can we learn from others and from the past?
What is family? This is both a question that is hard to answer, but equally quite easy; it depends on how you approach it. Quite a lot of people still see family in the given Husband, Wife, Kids in a family house, with a pet or whatever, making ends meet, educating each other and growing alonside each other experiencing life. The nuclear family as it were - is this sort of life achieveable for young people now, and is it something that is still desirable?I admit that inside me somewhere is a 1950s housewife that wants this sort of life, but the world is a very different place for people of my age (32) and younger as what a family means is becoming very different with subtle shifts in relationships and how people live. It's not beyond the realms of possibility but for me to have this life I would have to move home (about 300 miles due north) and certainly put professional goals aside to achieve this, and I think that is why the very concept of family is changing.For people younger than myself, a lot will have gone through education, moved away from home to go to university, and perhaps settled in the city they went to university in, or moved to another city to begin a career - it is rare that people will move back to their birth home after university, but it does happen on occasion. With this geographical move, people create their own strong friendships in a way to create their own family/support unit/call it what you will - I know that certainly is something that I have done. As a city dweller, the idea of the nuclear family seems something of an alien concept. If I were to have a family of my own, any children that came from this would almost certainly have a much wider concept of family as I have many wonderful friends who would add so much to the quality of life of any children, let alone the life of myself and any partner I had.Why is the idea of a nuclear family strange for a young city dweller like myself? I think it comes down to housing and money. I know that I will never be able to afford a house on my own. My family home was bought outright before I was born for £26,000. A family home, even in the town I grew up in, you are now looking at quadruple that price, and with wages dropping, banks not willing to back mortgages, and the rental market seemingly being an inescapable trap for most young people - the idea of family changes. Whilst relationships change and grow, our financial and geographical status may not.Away from the housing and financial aspects of what family means - why would family life be different to the one I grew up in? I live a much more alternative lifestyle than my parents did, and whilst they were very open to my alternative nature growing up, they were working class people who didn't want as much from life as I did. They wanted to raise their kids right (which they did), have the occasional holiday (yup) and go to the pub with their friends (yes). I would see my family life as a different thing, and would want as many of my friends involved as possible as they would bring a different angle on things - a much more varied point of view. The nuclear family doesn't exist in my mind as the family I have created for myself since leaving home is too great to not have an involvement in where I go from here on in, and I believe a lot of people would think in a similar way. As the world changes, so will relationships. As people move away from what they've always known, communities will be shaped differently. Young people see this and they won't be guided to create an old fashioned model (as politicians are so often found to espouse the moralities of!) if it doesn't fit their lives.I, for one, will continue to build my family in whatever way I see fit, and not to some model that doesn't work for me. I am sure it does for quite a lot of people, but to look forward, we need to accept and encourage all kinds of family situations and relationships, otherwise we will stay in a past that is not working.
Based in the heart of Sheffield, Access Space is the UK’s longest-running free internet learning centre, with thousands of participants making use of it every year – and it has achieved this without spending a penny on computers or software. Its model has inspired centres across Europe, while MetaReciclagem – a Brazilian initiative directly informed by Access Space – has now grown to a network of almost a hundred centres.I founded Access Space in 2000 - but I had the idea in 1996 - when I started an arts project called "Redundant Technology Initiative". I'm an artist, and I wanted to use my art practice to show the true situation in Sheffield, the city where I live. Sheffield has suffered structural problems from massive industrial change - the city used to be based on Coal mining and the Steel industry. Now the coal mines are closed, and the Steel mills are manned by robots. There is a very high level of unemployment in the city, and much of the employment that there is is in the public sector - most adults work for the government!Working as an artist, I saw that the city was failing to adapt to the emerging information economy - South Yorkshire had the lowest uptake of information technology in the UK. Meanwhile, I was making art from trash that I found in skips. Not only was the trash free (yes!) it seemed to me to be the most suitable material with which to make art about urban decline.Then I started to find computers in the trash. I collected them, with the idea that I would make robot sculptures and other crazy artworks. I was amazed to discover, after some experimentation, that most of the PCs I recovered actually worked! I started to think about why people were throwing these machines away - when the city had a low level of engagement with information technology.So I started an arts group, "Redundant Technology Initiative" with one rule - we would be the people who would be creative with trash computers. But ONLY trash computers! We would refuse to pay for any technology, and only use what we could get for free. (This was lucky, because me and my friends were unemployed or unpaid artists, and thus completely skint.) We had a few exhibitions, and each time we exhibited, people brought us more computers. Being artists, we made them into "an art installation". (Other people might think, with some justification, that what we had made was was just "a huge pile".)By 1998 we had rented a warehouse which was scheduled for demolition. One good feature of industrial decline is that space is cheap. We had more than 1000 computers (!!!) some of which worked, some of which could work, and some of which were broken. We made a HUGE installation for a digital arts festival... and then more and more people gave us computers. After a few weeks we had more than 2000 machines.We started to realise two things:(1) We didn't have any shortage of computers.(2) We did have a shortage of skill, expertise and creativity.We learned how to rebuild and reprogram computers really fast, and we found students who also wanted to help. A local college sent us their trainees on "work placement" - and they learned as they helped us to repair the massive numbers of machines. But we then had a very embarrassing problem for an art group. We just weren't creative enough. We couldn't think of cool things to do with more than about 100 computers - we needed to think of cool things to do with 100 computers PER MONTH.So we designed "Access Space" - a digital lab where people can walk in and show us how they could be creative and productive with trash technology. It took 2 years to raise enugh money to start, and after we started, we managed to get ERDF funding to match our initial funds. (NOTE that there was no way we could have accessed ERDF funding with our levels of experience. We came in as a minor delivery partner, insulated from the frightening bureaucracy of the project by more experienced lead partners. This was very lucky for us - and could start a whole new conversation.)So, in 2000 Access Space opened. We believed it would be a good model to help people get engaged with technology. We invite every visitor to define their OWN objectives with trash technology - it could be making images, sounds, music, robots, websites, designs, photo galleries... It could be building a business, making new networks, rebuilding computers, or whatever. Our key test is that people THEMSELVES set their agenda. We don't work with a curriculum. And we don't have teachers. Instead, we ask participants to help each other - and because they're all working on "cool stuff" not "boring stuff" then people are usually happy to help - and maybe gain ideas, skills and expertise from the experience.We provide a free, open access digital lab, doing all sorts of things, from computer analysis, repair and recycling to art exhibitions, workshops, peer-learning activities, enterprise incubation, social support and more. We set up this lab as a response to unemployment, urban decline and the transformation of the job market. What we've established is an innovative methodology to invest time, not money, in ICTs. This has huge potential to address worklessness and lack of opportunities. It's worth reflecting that many of our participants in Access Space experience the kind of precarity which you are investigating with Edgeryders.Access Space has a very wide range of participation.* If you split them into three groups, 50 years, then those groups are roughly similar in size.* Roughly 1/3 of our participants are from minority ethnic backgrounds.* Around 1/3 of our participants have a university education.* Almost 2/3 of our participants are unemployed, or under-employed.* Around 1/5 of our participants have some form of disability or long-term illness - particularly learning difficulties, like Asperger's Syndrome (associated with high intelligence) and mental health difficulties, such as depression.* 1/10 of our participants have a serious problem with housing. Either they're homeless, or they are living in insecure, or temporary accommodation.We had more than 2000 people use the space in 2011, which added up to more than 12000 hours of usage. Helping and facilitating this number of people, particularly when some of them have difficulties, is a huge job.When it comes to funding, the significance of Access Space's budget is how small it is for the outcomes it delivers. Access Space principally sustains itself by saving money. A typical annual budget is only around £100K. We have survived by raising funds, and by saving money. We save around £30000 each year by only using recycled computers and free, open source software. We have a very small core team (now usually 6, now 7 people, mostly part-time) who are on short-term contracts.Our special power with funding is the huge range of benefits that Access Space brings. We help people:* Make creative progress - by engaging with digital creativity.* Make technical progress - learning new high-tech skills.* Make social progress - by helping each other, and by working together, people learn crucial soft skills, and develop more useful networks.* Make progress with employability and enterprise. (These we see as the ultimate extension of all the types of progress people make.)This means that we have a wide range of stakeholders. We have been funded to:* Increase high-tech skills for local enterprises.* Get people involved with the digital arts.* Help people become "digitally included".* Research and test new models for peer learning.* Develop and incubate micro-enterprises.* Develop high-tech skills with innovation potential.* Help people to become included in mainstream society, and become more employable.What do we want? Funding, of course! However, we are aware that models based on funding are becoming increasingly under pressure. So we have started a "Friends" scheme, to ask our participants, and anyone else who thinks that the free opportunities we deliver are a good thing, to contribute.But we also need more participation by people who understand the challenge, and want to help. We want people who are interested to help us facilitate the community, build functioning social and economic networks, and experiment with how we can mobilise the talents and skills of the larger and larger number of unemployed people we encounter.We realise now that the most valuable technology that is being discarded by our society is PEOPLE. We are seeing talented, skilled people unmobilised, and we think that this is a criminal waste. We also see deeply uninspiring, value-free jobs (like working in call centres) as the only structural answer put forward by mainstream business and industry, and we want people to work with us to develop more inspiring, creative, engaging, and socially valuable jobs as an alternative.We need:* More volunteers who are interested to work with a wide range of people, and are interested to challenge social exclusion and division.* Enterprising people who are interested in starting their own business and can see the potential to work in a social, creative and technical context.* Open source software enthusiasts who want to help us spread the word. We have a number of specific software and hardware challenges which we could use help with.* Other spaces across Europe who would like to collaborate with us to develop a network of social, technical and creative spaces. We have contacts already, but many spaces are just "technical and social" or "creative and technical" or "social and creative". We are looking for groups that want to be "technical, social, AND creative".This would be the gist of what we're doing with this project. If you are passionate about techs and open source software, let me know and maybe we can collaborate. Also, if your're around Sheffield and would like to visit our establishment, also drop a line; We're currently working with x volunteers, but would be happy to take you in if you're up for this! Find us at:http://access-space.org/http://www.facebook.com/accessspacehttp://twitter.com/AccessSpaceFinally, to see our work in action, I leave you in the company of this video of the Recycle Mid-Weekend we organized in March last year: Now with added pizza! - Timelapse Video of Access Space Mega Recycle Mid-Weekend, March 2011 - V2 from Richard Bolam on Vimeo.
@trythis @Matthias Good stuff and thanks for getting practical. Many of my efforts recently have been along the lines of building communication networks that amplify the real knowledge of a community. This is helpful info. Was reading about the Nepal work recently. Respect!In an art context,  I’ve favoured systems that use cheap speakers & computing platforms - https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/What-is-Bela%3F The ritualistic attempt to voice what has not been voiced feels suited to something more public like a sculpture - eg. recent attempt with small bird sculpture in Liverpool that had speakers inside it http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/But you’re right that when it comes to spreading info & learning material, personal listening as you work is the way (& listening also cuts out the problem of not being able to study in the dark.) The mp3 system feels like it has really great potentials for education - and also distributing more taboo info like facts about AIDS and addiction treatment programmes. @trythis I will pass this on to Ngala and some NGOs working with addiction & will be in contact if there's interest.One question - why not distribute cheap phones rather than mp3 players? Is it battery considerations? Phones seem to be altogether more useful and could simplify the problem of how to get the audio back?On the subject of making the content accessible but also inspiring & interactive I think there's interesting creative questions. It’s pretty clear that ”digging into a niche” is going to be more effective as a distribution method (though realise this has to be proved if you’re doing an academic study.) When it comes to replicating the “human touch” that Ngala gave to his work through his supportive presence, it feels like powerful design of the audio experience can hold that sense of the encouragement and support of another person. Interested how you meet that creative design question? ie. recording compelling content and storytelling that addresses the listener in a way that encourages interaction. There’s a few decades of experiments with this personal & empowering mode of address in the self help / meditation / change your life audio genre…I reckon the other big creative challenge is a really accessible intuitive and compelling site that hosts all the monologues collected and that feels “alive” with the word of the community & updates often. Think there are some beautiful solutions evolving with immersive web and web VR. The clouds documentary http://cloudsdocumentary.com/  gives a nice example of fluidly exploring knowledge. But a challenge I’ve encountered is that curating and ensuring that the content remains relevant can be a full time job. However perhaps if you’ve got a strong interactive web design that role can be automated or distributed.@trythis Do you envision asking listeners to speak back to a particular question? That feels like it would have some good focus to it. On translating - I’m sure it’s a necessity to have local collaborators and fluent speakers of the language in the core team whenever this kind of knowledge share project runs. Perhaps also there’s something to learn from Duolingo and it’s method of getting language learners translating. There are so many language learning initiatives to encourage people back into learning languages other than english. If you can connect with people who are learning the language and you have the need for spoken translation, there's a useful match.Spreading info, language learning, cultural sharing and circulating cheap creative technology & making skills all feel like they go together well. I’ve met a lot of people working with teaching languages that are dwindling in numbers. Teachers of the Maori language and the Khoisan languages of the San Bushman people. They have often complained how young people are led away from learning about their own culture by fascination in smartphones / iPads / all things modern. Combining cultural knowledge & language learning with what is considered aspirational tech can be a big motivator. I’ll expand on this in another post when further down the line with it. Please ping me if you post news on your projects & @trythis I’ll connect you if I hear back from Ngala.
 Hi @Alberto - Alex’s description is correctYou can see examples of the some of the body maps created in this Youtube clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wEdaCpT7lcMary Anne explains TICAH’s process in more detail in this interview http://practicalmattersjournal.org/2011/03/01/burris-interview/
Yup, you can't get unique visits on Wikipedia ..well, thankfully :).  But even if we had page views, honestly, thinking twice, linking the assumption that people check medical article as proof that more people are interested in self diagnosis is a bit vague, as it is obsolute, and I don't know what to compare it to.  At the same time, for example, page views of ebola article, are no where close to Lady Gaga article, even during Ebola recent outbreak, but that doesn't directly mean that people don't care .  IMO, laternatively, questioning how many people cotributed to articles around health issues, or issues like water treatment, is another interestng indicator of how many people are willing to co-create care content, collaboratively.  Just saying!
@Noemi and everyone else you are more than welcome to also join! Would be great to meet in person and exchange information and ideas! I am sure @Jenny Gkiougki would love that as well :)
@Alex Levene this is great! I and people from our collective will be happy to meet with you and discuss about our projects and your experience in Calais. I will also try to see if I can find some cheap options to suggest for your stay. Looking forward to meeting you in Thessaloniki!
....as evidenced by the fact that I'm coding this 2 months after the fact! I am prioritising challenge responses, so if you think things have important info in them that need to be coded sooner rather than later, designate them challenge responses. otherwise, they will (hopefully) be coded eventually, but are not a priority. @Noemi 
Between Natalia having gone this summer, @Ybe just now, and you, well.. we should all go. Also ping @Jenny Gkiougki if she will be around.
@ChristinSa @To_Steki @Positive-Voice @Aravella SalonikidouI am planning on coming to Thessalonki in the middle of January. (15th-19th) Part of the trip will be touch volunteers and get to know what is being done there by Help Refugees (who i worked with in Calais this year). I'd also love to meet up with you and see your projects. If anyone has any suggestions for cheap places to stay whilst we're out there please let me know.
I may not use them straight away, but who knows what is around the next bend. :)In terms of players I found a couple really cheap at banggood.com (with earplugs & cable!) but I had problems ordering so I used various amazons (B001B43J8E and B01LAE19D6 ) for now. I actually want very limited capability on the players to start with so that you have to listen through a lecture to get to the infotainment/music part behind it. The cheapo players are fine for that. The other thing that is partially a feature is their crappy 110mAh battery. Currently I am testing the common failure modes, and it also looks like it will be possible to run them without battery directly from either a bucked 12V battery, or a boosted low voltage source (AAA), and of course sunny PV. All of those options (and more) will be in a full kit. In terms of wearing them - they work fine under a hat or headscarf. With 15g they should not be much of a nuisance around the neck either.As for mp3 recorder I think you are right - there is no really cheap option. I've bought this ASIN B01G8OK1O6 for 20$ and it works very well so far. However at that cost I can't hand them out to just anyone, but I first have to find reliable candidates. Probably I'll also have to work with other recording formats in the beginning. There are a couple of other somewhat decent recorders around 10-15$ but they don't save into mp3 or aren't exactly inuitive.Regarding your translation (I assume mostly into audio format) this is what I would do: Go around at the schools and ask the teachers if they can recommend someone who has a nice voice and good pronounciation and English skills. Ugliness, bad eyesight, physical deformity, rural upbringing is all a big plus. Probably won't hurt if you let 3-5 try translating and recording the same piece. Then find someone above average knowledgeable in the actual field work who has a somewhat deeper understanding of the issues and let him/her review the recordings. That is your first team. Then make second team like that and use it to translate some sections of the first piece back into English. Eventually you will probably need a Nepalese speaker who picks up enough audacity (the software) to process this intermediate product into a decent lecture - this person can sit anywhere though.
Hi @Rune,just got on this comment now. Great! Let's get in touch.monaco.federico@gmail.com
Thanks for the pointer, Alberto. Actually @trythis was the inspiration for the Rasoberry Pi local media servers after the Nepal earthquake last year, and this way also for Pocket University. Lots of inspiration coming from that guy :-) I'd be interested to utilize a small casting / pocket university like setup for teaching better coffee farming in Hansapur, Gorkha, Nepal. Which is the village for this year's trial of our "direct international sales of Nepali coffee" project. Just a small project for now, with a friend from last year going there around next week and then again in February. The problem is obviously getting the coffee farming content together, in Nepali …Edit 1: For extending smallcasting to two-way communication, it would of course be perfect to have a small cheap MP3 player with recorder. But does not exist as far as I know. Feedback recording via mobile phone is possible for >80% of people in low-infrastructure regions, but of course voice quality is an issue then. Most times, I get back to using old-ish smartphones since they are available for 
It's been quite difficult to work out exactly what my thoughts are on this subject. I've found some of the comments below to be helpful and insightful, but some to be problematic.There is certainly a strong link through poetry and literature to this idea. I've recently been reading a lot of Thomas Mann and it's almost the entire structure on which his work is predicated. There seems to have been a sensibility that was propagrated in the late 1800s -early 1900s European intellectual/artisan culture around 'bohemianism' or latterly 'bourgouise'. I think in some senses it emerges out of a combination of Romanticism (in poetry and visual art) and it's opposite reaction, Realism (in painting and literature) and the beginnings of the sentimental nostalagia-tinged classical music of people like Verdi and the German/Austrians like Liszt, Mendelsohn. The 'struggling artist' becomes a trope, a series of hooks onto which musicians, writers and painters can hang their emotional responses to the world. The struggles of the artist can therefore be equated to the struggles of the working, pastoral man and woman, who often during this period are the themes on which the artist work. c.f Beethoven's 6th, Robert Burn's Poetry, Victor Hugo. Which becomes an important connection between the (usually rich, educated and entitled) artists and the philosophy of people like Rosseau and Locke who want to improve the human condition for all. More of a History of Art and Ideas response to the idea, and certainly not my final views on the subject, but i thought i'd add a bit more to this already in-depth post.Also, worth having a quick read of this piece i found today: http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/literary-madness/
We combined our idea soups on the topic for the Nepal Hackathon but I think both of us had similar ideas bouncing around for year before that.Small casting is just another riff on the concept which would share a lot of the same hardware and some of the same content I assume. After reading around a lot of the World Bank issues it seemed to me a good MVP-style approach that could disintermediate and also flank their ongoing projects.One point that set it apart from PU is that this one is more geared towards information flow BACK to the party doing an intervention. The idea is that staff will get a handful of mp3 players (and colored pearls for stringing up) with say 2-3 different sets of "directions" to traverse the OFFLINE social networks to carry on them at all times. When they come across an "interesting person" (e.g. very altruistic behavior, subject to certain condition, etc.) they can, without a word, hand them the mp3 player and things can expand from there. With the right incentives (perhaps including m-pesa) there is potential for large amounts of very detailed quant (coded with the colored pearls) + qual that should be relatively undistorted.By default one could have most of the players in circulation doing more of a PU for poor young women with the appropriate content and a good amount of infotainment mixed in. And of course 1-2 tracks for repairing/charging etc. the players, 2-3 tracks for getting the feedback from the women, and perhaps another couple (later in the process) for building the capability to translate/record additional lectures into the local language.I currently have envisioned about 100 mp3 players (shared among 2-3 people each) with appropriate support to keep them going for a couple of months minimum in the field which runs slightly above 1000 USD. Of course it'll be critical to work on ways to reduce the technical attrition rate and balance/channel "misuse" into something arguably helpful.Then it would be interesting to see how results vary between a "helicopter distribution" vs "digging into a niche". And of course on the horizon is the ability to plug these collected monologues or discussion into a platform like ER. That way you're not only getting the "word on the street" but also the "word at the water hole" with some lag in very rural places.

It wasn't clear to me, but if i have it correctly:You draw an outline of your body (real sized, or smaller) and then you connect personal experiences, traumas, memories etc to certain body areas by writing on them on the picture.For example, if you suffered a physical trauma to your right arm because of a car crash you might write Car Crash on the right forearm. It's a nice way of visualising the experiences that make up your life. Although they are highly personal, they can also create anonymity because they are pictures, not stories. We carry our scars around with us, but unless you tell people the story (relive the experience) we don't know the difference between the person who broke their arm falling down stairs when drunk and the person who experienced brutality or torture.
I watched the Directors cut of the film and at nearly 3.30hrs it was one of the most confusing and harrowing experiences on film i've ever had. That said, there is a moment towards the end where you start to see under the mask of the protagonists. There is a moment when you realise that this really has affected them and they are questioning their decisions. It's really small but very powerful. I think that's why the filmmaker went back to the same subject to make a follow up film. Which i haven't seen yet.
I haven't had time to go over all content here yet but I just came across this presentation that may be relevant for a number of reasons.Policing in Post-Conflict Societies, pulled from the transscript and slightly edited: 6:03 because when the Ugandan police force 6:06 was rebranded as the Ugandan National 6:09 Police a lot of people said to the 6:12 inspector general who is basically the 6:13 chief officer why not the Ugandan police 6:16 service and his reply was cross and i 6:20 quote cops are not waitresses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-TkdX2o8M
@trythis this reminds me of the concept of "pocket university" proposed by @Matthias . :-)
Apologies if it is clear to everyone else. Happy to follow a link if you give me one.
These stories here are so well written and impressive - and this one particularly so.It still took me a few attempts to endeavour it, because more often than not it'll tempt you to throw everything down and want to help with what the author is working on. This one is no exception.However this time I've been busy with something that could make a contribution that is interesting to your case ( @kate g ) . I've been meaning to do it as a little story aswell but it really is only hobby format now - and I'd need someone with other background to apply it.To keep it really brief I'll just lay out the bare bones, though in application it could be tweaked in very different directions (education, journalism, anthropology/ethnography).In terms of concept think the opposite of broadcasting*, where one signal (on one schedule) goes out to everyone. Here I try to reach niches, perhaps indirectly, as much on their schedule & terms as possible, and I listen to them (ratio of listen/tell can be tweaked).In terms of hardware I am currently sitting on 10 cheapo mp3 players and some mp3 voice recorders. The idea is to put some audio content on a small memory card (perhaps also some visual content e.g. on playing card size). This costs 2-3 $ and can hold days worth of structured audio content. The strucure of the content is important because I hope to turn the play+listener into a temporary agent (a little tolkeen's ring style). So you would have incentives there for the player (or several) to traverse the community networks in a mix of chance, human behavior, and programming, and hopefully end up in someones lap who may have been incredibly hard to find using other methods.You can then get the recorder to this person (or have the person respond via a phone recording in a "relatively 1st world context") and document things in long form (8 GB - up to a week). Parts of this will be amiable for speech to text conversion. ( @brenoust that is why I asked the last time we talked)Once you get the text corpus you can open it up the the digital domain ( @Amelia can then probably mine this from an enthnograpic/anthropologic perspective) while it can remail fully anonymous. I also have a concept in mind for quantitative feedback which is similarly simple tech for users (colored beads on a string) but machine readable.That way you get quant + qual abstractions but you can still jump to the original content fairly easily (provided you speak the language). It ought to scale quite well, especially if you can reuse some of the players.The motivation for this came from a number of directions (OLPC griping, importance to capture emotion in human interaction, World Bank issues/capability building (two way!)) so I've played through a couple of different concepts that can perhaps be divided by organizational/technical aspects, content/didactic aspects, and info flow direction/volume.I'm currently working on putting together a prototype kit that could plausibly run for a couple of months (and with minor support perhaps years) as a replacement for a "sit-in school" in remote areas that have trouble with teacher absenteeism ( @Nadia perhaps interesting to Olivier @ Co - also best of luck in Paris!) and people being too poor to abstain from manual labour for so long (and of course blind, illiterate, etc.). At the moment I'm checking the recharge curves to see how long the cheapo players will survive before someone needds to know how to fix/replace/work around the battery. If any of you see potential there I'd be happy to discuss it and set it up as a proper story.*that is why the working title is currently "small casting". Suggestions welcome :)
@WinniePoncelet Thanks. Wise succinct summary. Apreciated.  @Noemi I'll write at the December meet. & yes, we had problems getting tickets too. Last batch of tickets go on sale 2016-11-25 10:00 (Fr). Good luck!
@Alex Levene I will watch these films. Even watching the trailers it’s clear that the film is pushing against people’s desire not to talk about what happened. Which is a very human way of dealing with confounding horror and disgust. Using performance and re-enactment to go right into what happened is almost unbearably powerful. Just read your post over at https://edgeryders.eu/en/the-culture-squad/how-can-the-arts-side-of-culture-feed-into-the-work A great thread! How did you get on with the application? It feels ridiculous in many ways for me to talk about innovating new digital networks when this year I have spent little time online (apart from a Facebook flurry during Brexit vote & November the 8th). I've missed a lot of posts & sharing. Too much work in VR headsets for too many years means that my stamina for interacting through screens is at an all time low.But the networks I have engaged with are some sessions I've been running on Hacking Reality and a group set up by Charlotte Pulver in London to get muddy and clear out springs on Hamstead Heath. The outdoor emphasis of my life at the moment shifts my interest in networked technologies - more emphasis on Augmented Reality, GPS for content, lasers and light, alternative communication systems… Feel you intuitions on care and art are on the right track.Hope some Edgeryders will be about at the Chaos Computer Club in Dec to meet on care and going forwards into 2017. Will share some more developments in the new year too & make a concerted effort to login. 
This comment sums it up for me. Conversation and understanding turn coping into progress.The process can be a catalyst towards peace of mind and balance, which is a healthier attitude than striving for an unattainable bliss where there's no trace or memory of the negative experience. The former is resilient for the future, the latter is very fragile. When you start purging negative emotions, there's usually some collateral damage and you end up taking down good things as well.Thank you for sharing this Kate, and thanks for the extra links Alex.
I found that documentary very very scary in its realism and portrayal of cold blood grotesque crimes and the fact that there seemed to be no redemption whatsoever, no healing, no sense of humanity at all. Perhaps I need to watch it again, but there is no way I could make sense of what happened by the end of it.. I wonder if those inhabiting that space could. ever. and what that tells us.Thank you @kate g for the piece, I hope you do get to write the second one and also that we'll meet at ccc. We seem to not be able to buy tickets this year because of high demand. Let's see.
"Popular culture tends to talk about purging emotions, as if emotions are toxic material that needs ejecting from your system, but what Ngala’s work shows is that the magic is in the courage to speak honestly and the grace of being heard: that’s when emotions turn into understanding"Certainly a lot to think about.Thank you for sharing your work with us and teachigng me about Denis' initiative.I wondered also if you were aware of the work Joshua Oppenheimer has done on film with http://dogwoof.com/theactofkilling and http://dogwoof.com/thelookofsilence on the Indonesian genocide?

Great! Let's talk on Skype if you're up for that @dfko . I read @trythis  is also interested in joining the discussion. You can find me under my name on Skype (or Twitter) and we can find a moment to call via there.
... at least for what we had in mind.We first hoped we could infer how pages were co-accessed (pages part of the Medicine project or the other projects you mention), as a way to understand how people perform self-diagnosis. But we then realized there were no data to help us infer that type of page co-access, no IP addresses or anything that would indicate two pages were consulted by a same person within a close time interval.@MoE and @dora had nevertheless come up with pretty nice visualization of the wikipedia pages dataset. See this thread to catch on what happened at  Masters of Networks 4/LOTE5 around this. Also have a look at the  post-workshop doc.
Well this was posted before I joined, and apparently I missed it in the archive.  So, Wikimedia doesn't store IP addresses (thanks to privacy) so we can not identify the visitor by IP, and we can't traget hospitals.There is a new tool that helps get page views per category: See the page views for medecine articles for example. Data is downloadable.Related to the topic there is also https://twitter.com/WikiProjectMed, a community lead initiative that has a good impact. I can narratively add some related stories from there, but everything will be in retrospective.
Sounds like the edge of dinners.. these aren't just leftover ingredients, but leftover food (potentially cooked) if I understand well! Whoa. Thanks for the reference, Natalia.
This sounds fantastic. I'd love to visit thast next time i'm in Berlin (hopefully soon)I've been thinking about organising something like this in the UK. Especially with that sound/music/performance narrative to it. I will certainly check that out.
Thank you for compliments, @Noemi! I have something to add to this collection of great ideas and initiatives. In Berlin, there is a group of young Philipino/Brasilian artists called Nowhere Kitchen who cook with surplus food. But there is so much more to it - they engage the people in chopping and preparing, but they take over the cooking process, so we do not end up with random, kind of awful food. Their recipes were stunning and combinations of tastes surprisingly delicious. The whole evening a guy was jamming to it some ambient/psychedelic stuff on guitar, and when the serving time came, they did a whole spiritual performance before we started eating. I've been there, and some people from the street came around to join in. It was beautiful! And I think in such a delightful form eating leftovers can be dignified, and very political. (OK, some say the food didn't come out always as great as I remember it - that's probably the rule of cooking with random leftovers). 
Thanks, @Noemi :)Please hook me up, I'd love to help, however much I can, prior to and during the event.
Wow, @WinniePoncelet and @dfko ! This is a wonderful vision: biohacking spaces all over the world collaborating on a difficult process like producing insulin. In the software world, we see this a lot. Turns out much software work is "packetizable": the whole is much more valuable than the sum of its parts, but a single part still has some value, and it can be built in relative independence from the other parts. Think Wikipedia: it is so great because it spans human knowledge, but I can work on my entry about, say, the Duchy of Modena with no need to coordinate with you guys as you edit the kin selection entry. @dfko , is making open insulin that kind of work? Can it be broken down into pieces that Winnie could take and work on? 
The above proposal is about an app for mobility navigation rather than a wheelchair issue. However a few people has contributed to a specifications doc. Next up is implementation. Anyone? 
Thanks for the analysis Noemi. Grit is about all we've got right now! It's gotten us some results in the lab and gotten many people interested in helping out. And it has been key, in the preceding years, to founding the hacker space itself that we work out of. We've gone out on a limb and inspired some people and now we need to make the most of this interest. Influencing politics in favor of the values we're trying to serve is a side interest of most of the team and we're hoping in collaborating with Edgeryders here to be able to contribute to these broader questions even as we focus on our scientific and engineering work.
This is exactly the kind of scenario that motivates our work! To get there it seems we may need to move beyond a manual protocol to automating the production at a small scale though - as you mention, even professional underground organic chemists need a broader base of skill to express and purify proteins.
Thanks for following Winnie!We've been occupied enough with holding the lab work together that we haven't gotten around to tackling the aspect of establishing partnerships with any sustained effort. Though perhaps a half-dozen potential collaborators with serious interest have reached out, we're still at the point of initial discussions.I'd love to discuss more about your hacker space in Ghent to see how you can get involved!
Timeframe for thinking about it = maybe to the end of November. I will have to present an explanation of the concept to be included in the Festival publicity around that time. Once that goes in there will be limited opportunity to dramatically change the theme and concept, although the structure can be tweaked until the final day.I think that the collaborative writing approach is a strong one because we would be looking to write in English, with native English speakeres. I think, because its part of an arts festival, that we will attract people with a lot of writing and performing experience and skill.
Happy to discuss ideas with @Natalia_Skoczylas. I know she is getting ready to go to Asia at the moment, but i will also reaquiant myself with the Nepal projects and look at the outcomes and lessons learnt.Happy for this to be included in the Opencare, it's coming out of the People on the move strand of activity anyway.
Not sure if this is the right event project for them to fund at this point. But very interesting to know they are looking at a distributed and widespread project that uses the arts and culture to engage directly with refugees. This would certainly be of interest to us (Crew for Calais) as it is part of the approach we are looking at for our future development.Perhaps this person could be encouraged to come and participate in the event in a personal capacity (they will certainly have useful experience and skills) and afterwards we can discuss more about possible collaboration opportunities?There are 2 organisations that are well poised to help provide a link between refugee services and arts/culture, Crew for Calais and Good Chance Calais. The links between the 2 orgs are growing stronger and so there is a real potential for an interesting and exciting collaboration if Oxfam got behind us! It would be really satisfying to me if we could bring it to fruition.
Hey! Of course Natalia is our go to person, it was their work in Nepal which inspired this in the first place. Bridget is a dear, like always.. And if this happens in London I think it's even more of an opportunity. The discussion where Alex mentioned you had to do with how would we look for funding for a project involving research and mapping of preparedness to care for refugees in very concrete terms eg packing clothes in a backpack based on criteria and systems different working  groups involved in refugee work have experimented with. How do we package the knowledge? (see this discussion: https://edgeryders.eu/en/backpacks-for-the-refugees-the-day-after) Finally,  OK to adding this to ethnographic material base. 
I hope to find a bit more time to be involved. I've been busy! I will tell the person I know at Oxfam about Edgeryders. She is hoping that it is a distributed, widespread project, I think. Bridget
Hey guys – this is great! Three small points.Consider talking to the wonderful @Natalia Skoczylas , whose hand is obvious in the citizen journalism/storytelling workshop organised under the ER aegis in Nepal. If @Bridget McKenzie engages in the Culture Squad, our prospects look up! Would you guys be OK with me adding this thread to the opencare community group as well? This would make it part of the opencare ethnographic study. 
Hello, I've been away without wifi, and not catching up with email but I did spot one that asked about funding for this (?) project. I can't find that message now. I wanted to mention that Oxfam might be interested in funding a programme that uses culture to directly engage and support refugees. I know someone there talking about it. I don't know about Wellcome but it depends what project idea you were referring to in your original message. 
As an Arabic English speaker, am happy to volunteer for that.
There seems to be some interesting stuff happening in fringe genres, like erotica and my favourite, hard sci-fi. But yes, that's anecdotal. I have dropped out of studying that stuff since, and moved onto greener pastures. Which itself is a kind of anecdotal analysis. "Long tail" markets would feature many niches, each one with the economies of scale in consumption aforementioned, but making space for more artists just by virtue of being many. So your question is theoretically valid, but I do not know the answer.
Interesting economic analysis, @Alberto. Is there any evidence that the 'long tail' effect is changing things in artistic 'markets'?There were a lot of promises a few years back that the internet would make many more people able to be sustainable successful at a smaller scale [curating a fanbase of a few thousand fanatically-loyal people, say, while presumably supplementing income from art with other jobs and roles], and I know of a few anecdotal examples of artists doing just that, but my general impression is that those promises were not delivered on.
Just linking in @Noemi's post on running from a failed medical system in Romania. https://edgeryders.eu/en/when-do-you-decide-that-running-from-a-failed-medical-system-is-noOne thing it has brought into stark relief for me is the interplay between using Opencare projects to try to build community [as well as make people healthier], as is often the case with Community Acupuncture projects, and the sort of thing that is possible when strong bonds of solidarity [being poor, being Amish] already exist.Unfortunately, in much of Europe, it seems like many people have used rising living standards as a way of stepping out of engagement with community and society - and it is only when economic or other disasters strike that they are forced into connection with one another once more.The best way to deal with the uncertain futures ahead would be for people to start building those localised, horizontal connections beforehand - but the cynic in me suggests that they will always wait until necessity forces their hand.
Excellent point, @Alex Levene . This could be fundamental to the opencare vision. We propose that communities are good candidates for being caregivers, because they are fair (they share the burden across individuals), efficient (allocation of who takes care of whom is based on self-selection: low overhead, you give care when and where you are readiest/most motivated to do so, receive it in the time and domain of your greatest need), and retain a human touch that state-and private sector provided care cannot (you care for your own, etc.). This is predicated on the givers and receivers of care recognizing each other as one: everyone is part of the same "we". When a person is recognized as not part of the "we", the community's incentive to care for her fails. And it would be unwise to put it down to human error or happenstance. Some scientists argue convingly that for humans to divide between "us" and "them" is innate, because in our hunter-gatherer past we evolved under selection pressure at the group level. A full argument is made by E.O. Wilson in The Social Conquest of Earth. Thanks to @WinniePoncelet for recommending the book to me. 
Thanks for the comment, @WinniePoncelet, and glad to hear you found the cause of the problem in the end.Your distinction between authority and power is very useful. The point about different cultures reifying the system vs the person is also very relevant here - the problems around regulation and recognition of traditional acupuncture in the west can basically all be traced back to the original error of accepting the setting of the terms of debate around the technique 'acupuncture' rather than the practitioner.Indeed, I call myself an 'acupuncturist' because people are familiar with the term - but a doctor or physio who has done a few weekends training in the technique can also legitimately call themselves an acupuncturist. In reality, I am a 'traditional medicine practitioner' who uses a variety of techniques, including acupuncture. The main point of coming to me is for my knowledge of chinese medicine theory, my diagnostic skill and my years of training in using the needle [or cup, or hand] to effect change in the body.And there is an additional hurdle to overcome; I am using an unfamiliar medical paradigm and technique that people do not necessarily have trust in [at first] - and I am doing so outside of the usual recognised channels of 'medical authority'. So I have to simultaneously convince a patient of the soundness of the medical approach as a whole and of my own competence - when they may be used to thinking in terms of trust in the system and not the individual.This is why I was keen to have patients provide some of the impetus for engagement themselves - if they waver in their trust of me or the medicine there is no institutional push for them to remain in treatment as there is in mainstream medicine.But evidently part of keeping them engaged is providing that sense of medical authority that they want.So now I'm thinking about how I can generate the kind of reassuring authority I need without falling into the established patterns of power relationships we are used to in the west.
Yes, that's the document that @steelweaver might be interested in reading. I certainly found it illuminating. 
I'd like to explicitly, out loud, acknowledge the super ideas and contributions people have been bringing to this conversation. What months ago started as a shy question by Pauline about the relationship between creativity and mental illness became slowly a rich discussion on artistic education, creative angst and vulnerability in various professions and particularly how personal attributes like introvertedness, autism, ambition, self-deceit, psychological resourcefullness at large influence the wellbeing of our professional self. What depth! Re-reading it all makes for some pretty deep reflection points on a Sunday afternoon. Thank you @Pauline | @Alex Levene | @Maria | @Patrick_Andrews | @Altamirula | @steelweaver | @ybe |  @trythis | @Georgiana_B. | @Alberto.
The thing that is pretty scary to me is this idea of arriving at an end of it, figuring out where your path is gonna take you, or worse, like this guy in the video you shared says, discovering "what you've been put on earth do do". I think starting off with that mindset is freakish.. 
I thought we absolutely need to go with a creative output, but good to know there's no boundaries. Other than that, my preference for a writing workshop is also that it's the only thing my mind works with - text. If you or someone likes a different approach to changing the narrative, I would totally go for it.. maybe we set a window for exploring ideas, then we commit to one and plan the thing concretely. Again, I'm very happy to get involved in preps, even though I might not be in Europe at the actual time.. :-(Collaborative writing would be taking @Matthias 's work in Nepal up a notch and there is plenty of stuff to build on, so great learning guaranteed!
There's some really good thoughts here.The Hackathon around changing the narrative is scheduled for the Sat 25th Feb, 1pm-5pm.I'm wary of spreading ourselves too thin and trying to achieve too much in a limited amount of time on the day. I agree that producing something concrete as a result would be preferable. Whether that needs to be specifically creative output (e.g. written work) i'm not sure. Crew for Calais has a lot of creative output happening at the festival (I'll explain more when it's more finalised - if you like cutting-edge perfoming arts mixed with your social activism then this will be a festival for you!)However, if we could encourage people into writing groups and get people to write a series of different format pieces (e.g. Blog post, Letter to a newspaper, Newspaper comment section post, newspaper article [comment is free type], Letter to their representative [EU, Westminster] etc...) These could be co-authored in groups, and then made available to everyone, participants or interested outsiders to use and send to the correct sources.It's also possible that we could have some non-written content made - videos, short podcasts. That would depend on having the correct personnel in the room, but we could definitely have the equipment available so that it's another choice.To me, i'm starting to see the bare bones of a structure.The workathon isn't scheduled yet, but we could do it before the 10th Feb.I'm still waiting to hear back from Tin Gerber to see if he's interested in helping me set it up. If not i'll press ahead anyway. I've also discussed a variation on the idea. I don't know if i'll have time to make it happen, but it's basically the same except we solicit paid tasks from theatres, performances companies, festivals and others in our field, then we get arts professionals together to do that work on a day and the money is paid to Crew for Calais or Help Refugees aid.Same premise, different cross section of participants.
To me what @alkasem23 is saying has more to do with the way we spend our time and attention, the everyday decisions we make, of which many are more artificial than essential. Not to generalize of course, but materiality is definitely what makes today's West as far as I'm concerned."Why, then, if expensive things cannot bring us remarkable joy, are we so powerfully drawn to them? Because of an error similar to that of the migraine sufferer who drills a hole in the side of his skull: because expensive objects can feel like plausible solutions to needs we don't understand. Objects mimic in a material dimension what we require in a psychological one [] Our weak understanding of our needs is aggravated by what Epicurus termed 'idle opinions' of those around us, which do not reflect the natural hierarchy of our needs, emphasizing luxury and riches, seldom friendship, freedom and thought." - Alain de Botton, Consolations of philosopy. 
Politically, we can see a large divide in the aspiration and acceptance of 'outsiders' between the generations.My Grandmother (and many thousands her age) have become increasingly conservative in their world view. From what i can gather, their experiences growing up straight after WW2 in a culture that still had lots of echoes of the wartime propaganda left an indelible mark on their attitudes to the outsider. I grew up in a multi-ethnic society, with children from multiple places around the globe. To me, there is no fear or mistrust in seeing people from other ethnic backgrounds around me. But for my grandparents, there is a lingering Nationalism, a lack of acceptance of 'otherness' - socially, sexually, racially. Brought up in the social strictures of oost-war Britain they reject the social liberalisation that they have lived through. One could argue that they didn't really get to experience the full force of the social liberalisation. Many married young and had children young, many women stayed as full-time child carers and had little interaction outside of the home. Many had large families in the models of their parents before them. Their children have experienced the social liberalisation fully (sexual revolution, oral contraceptives, relaxation of the divorce laws), they grew up with a few non-white faces around them because of Windrush (immigration to UK from newly Independent West Indies) or from Indian sub-continental immigration before and after Partition. Their children (my parent's generation) were also the first people to truely benefit from the way that membership of the EU opened up travel around Europe and the North African coastline. They experienced the realities of live in other countries and these experiences changed how they think. My grandmother has never been outside the UK in her entire life.Now, at the point when she is starting to struggle with self care (and here i definitely agree with @johncoate 's view that there is a stubborness and irrational sense of personal independence in their generation) more of the balance of looking after her falls on her kids, whose lives have been so different from hers.My point then is a difficult one to conceed. Although my grandmother is my family and helped to raise me, i find spending time with her very difficult. Her views are borderline racist at times, her attitude to the world is very negative, her experience is narrow and her opinions old fashioned. I am expected to show respect and deference to her based purely on the fact that she is older than me, yet i know my experience of the world is richer and wider than hers. I wouldn't want to be forced into living in that straight-jacket in order to reduce care costs.I do think that there are some positive ideas coming through around intergenerational living though. It's not that i'm intrinsically against 'old people', i think the irony is that i'm not especially fond of MY 'old people'. I would be more than willing to help look after a number of more liberally minded old people. It comes down the idea first put forward in the Open&Change discussion in HuisVDH "Free, but alone." vs. "Belonging, but coerced" For me, i'd rather free and alone. But i can also see the attraction of belonging. But not the coersion.Perhaps this strength of intergenerational bond in Middle Eastern culture is down to having a more cohesive and consistant view of the world than we have in the West. Our horizons have expanded to include views about social and personal freedom that still struggle to gain ground in more conservative cultures.
There are heaps of literature how this splintering and individualization of society allows for a reorganization that allows modern industrial society to operate much better. Of course if one sees many of the problems industrial society brings with it, a case could be made that we've partially overdone it, perhaps to the detriment of our (and other peoples) health and our environment.Regarding "What am I going to wear today?" - this is a very old story. It dates back many thousand years, and huge investment into clothes and especially ornament can be found with many hunter & gatherer cultures.But I am sure the subtle and not so subtle differences will start a lot of thought processes about things you've until now taken for granted. In Marseille I see quite different approaches to dressing and style whith street scenes looking quite different depending on day of the week or time of day. I find it quite interesting but don't spend much time on this myself.
Alberto was referring to https://edgeryders.eu/en/comment/18173#comment-18173
Here is a vid from a person from a very different milieu I think, and still there are many parallels. He's more expecting 7 shifts though:https://youtu.be/qfVy_NnbZPE?t=607You can just watch 7 or so minutes, but perhaps @dfko would be interested in the whole thing - I could imagine there could be some mutual benefit in that approach as well.
Regarding "There seems to be something intrinsic about the creative craft that makes people doubt themselves completely. The tyranny of the white page could be well found in the white canvas … "I am not someone who enjoys writing a whole lot, but let me share two items. The Dunning-Kruger effect probably explains some of this. It works indirectly though: Literacy is something that tends to draw an intelligent crowd. Those people tend to read material produced by other relatively intelligent people. If you decide you also have something to contribute, you will often feel like you'd better not be one of the worst of authors (even though for mere mortals there may not be a realistic way around that - as most people just need the practice). That means people who actually decide to write are a tiny minority and probably quite far from the average. So in short: writing does not produce (particularly much) anxiety, but it tends to draw an anxiety plagued crowd. When I read how fairly prolific writers approach the task (journalists on reddit, or academics for scientific proposals) I was shocked by the lack of rigor and decorum.The other item I fould almost universally helpful and reconiling is a list of cognitive biases. For me it very much drives home the point that the mind really is a very messy thing that is quite dismal at some tasks and quite impressive at others. And we are probably very lucky there is a good deal of variation between people.
@Alberto s mention slipped the radar there. Funny enough I was just procrastinating by listening to a video on procastination. I think it is long and general enough that various people could get something out of it. Just to address the "getting things done" angle. :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KysVad2dr-cOn face vs screen, etc. I think you are right that certain methods work better (or just more comfortably?) with some people (on some topics). You'll get different discussions and different outcomes. I think face to face helps my mirror neurons fire up fully. I often feel I can only really fully develop many aspects of a thought in a discussion. On the other hand I also like to listen to a recorded discussion afterwards and focus my thought much more on certain aspects without being afraid I have to answer some question or lose track of a discussion. I can be fully in observer mode and my thinking is much more like if I am editing someone else's text and want examine and fix every little bit of imprecision.Another thing that could make face to face meetings different is that you can smell the person and the environment. Also a LOT of our nervous system is connected to the stomach/digestive tract (the face and brain came way later!) so I would not be surprised if there is more purpose to business/conference dinners than to knock out the prefrontal cortex a little (althought that can also help).
I am more a engineer/scientist on the dead matter side of things - but I know just enough to understand that this is a pretty big thing.If you do skype with @WinniePoncelet I'd love to be a fly on the wall and see if I can contribute in some way.Do you know the question function of research gate? Insulin comes up with 385 researchers who follow the topic and 300 questions discussed. I often get good and detailed responses on things that you usually have a hard time finding in papers. Check here: https://www.researchgate.net/topic/insulin
Thanks @WinniePoncelet for the connections, I hope we get to learn from each other. Checked out Juice for Change and surprise: recognized @ElienShr :-) Elien, are you involved in it, or can you tell us more? Also in Bxl, I remember we partnered up with Disco Soupe for Living on the Edge 5, and it was pretty cool. Very professionally managed event even though the setup was new to the team too!@saby thanks for feedback! the next event is on Nov 26th, I wont be there but you know your way. If you want to volunteer a few hours with the team ahead of the actual event let me know and I'll hook you up.
Hello @dfko! The Open Insulin project inspired my friends and me a lot, which ultimately led to starting ReaGent, a DIYbio space in Ghent, Belgium. We've been going for about a year now.I'm sure there are more people with similar stories and who would love to help you - us included. Let me know if you want to skype sometime to discuss what we can contribute. Have you reached out or collaborated internationally before?
A much-needed initiative and a fun night at that, congratulations!In Belgium there is a lot of stuff happening around food surplus. Plenty of young people are launching projects and little companies around the idea. Mainly in Brussels, but also in Ghent and other cities. There's a an overarching organisation that connects and supports all the initiatives: Food Surplus Entrepreneurs Network. They share experience, knowledge, connections and raise awareness.The last weeks they did a succesful campaign for recuperating surplus apples, Juice for Change. Fruit leftovers are a major problem for Belgian farmers at the moment. From idea to execution and launching their crowdfunding it took about one week, with plenty of volunteers pitching in.I hear similar community dinners popping up here and there, but I haven't been.
I'm Sabina, an Environmental Protection master's student from Cluj, Ro, who has attended the event.I was honestly very impressed with the event, I congratulate the initiative and the work behind it and even if I was there only to help with the preparing of the food, tasting of the delicious soup and amazing carrot cake, I couldn't help but notice and fully enjoy the community feeling roaming around while slicing potatoes and washing dishes while the food was being prepared by the chefs and volunteers.Even though my thesis is precisely on Food Waste, and I've gained knowledge on the issue while researching, I was so sad to find out about the baby spinach, lemon and other products that were left to rot next to one of the hypermarkets' dumpsters in town. ... I can only be happy the Food Waste Combat team came 'to the rescue' and I hope I will be able to attend more of their events (and give a helping hand) that would slowly bring awareness regarding this burning issue that we only see the smoke of... yet.
My two cents, @dfko, as someone involved in building a movement (as one seems to be these days, as if there's no other way [sic]):Not to be too pessimistic although it's in the air given recent events in the US, but it seems that no matter how good a scientist or how decent your values are, or how promising your early results: common decency is no longer enough and one has to have grit. In other words, I feel more and more that any ambitious effort to lead to greater equality, access, fairness in the world needs to become somewhat political and build consistent support behind them. Example: look at Academia as a space for sharing expertise and see whether it is going in the right direction paywalling everything and being very slow to reform in terms of open access policies. What you have is a set of no-way-out reactions, people like A. Swartz or this lady in Kazakhstan taking action in their own hands. I would not favor those of course, but middle ways are long term battles with a lot of coordination across the net. Repeat, repeat, repeat.. 
Oh, you have plenty of time. I left professional music at 34. It was a struggle to get back to being a freelance economist, but it could be done. After a few lean years, I got a breakthrough at the age of 41. When I turned 45, I took on an international job and left the country. Another two years later I co-founded Edgeryders, and this year, at 50, the transition from freelance economist to working full time for my own company seems complete. 30 years, you'll probably change your professional identity not one, but twice. In fact, Edgeryders exists in part to provide a ramp to people that want to do this stuff. I took it head on, but it does not have to be lke that. Noemi will tell you more about this if you are interested. :-)In our current line of work there is some of the persistent, low-level panic of the artist's work, because there are fads in consultancy, and people hustle, and it's important to be seen in the right places. But the market is NOT winner-takes-it-all. Companies need help, and they can't all get the top ten guys in the business, because those guys can only sell 100% of their time. 
a very powerful testimony indeed. took my breath awaythank you for that @alkasem23
Hi, @AlbertoThank you. I'm new to the platform, indeed. I was kindly introduced to the thread by Noemi, my dear friend.You pointed out so well that being poor, scared and stressed out is as limiting as not practicing one's art as their profession! It’s curious what makes people choose one or the other. One theory I heard recently at a sociology of arts conference was that people in these fields keep thinking that the next gig/exhibition etc. will be the big break. Costly naivety/ self-deceit  :)So, the theory you mentioned and the article you recommended are new to me and I find they describe aspects of the arts-market relationship, amongst others, very accurately. Thank you for sharing this with me! Before reading these, I was thinking about how creative fields and other professions, like sports, have some similar stress sources, and this was confirmed and explained by the superstar economy theory.As useful and valid this is, I think it explains things only in part. One idea that comes to mind is the notoriously anxiety-inducing profession of writing. There seems to be something intrinsic about the creative craft that makes people doubt themselves completely. The tyranny of the white page could be well found in the white canvas …Besides this intrinsic source of anxiety, which, again, I'm quite uninformed about, I see a few more layers. As you were saying, Alberto, a strong one would be the characteristics of the winner-takes-it-all labor markets, and others might hover between the two, like self-belief, identity issues etc. I imagine a tension, a dynamic.Noemi, you phrased it wonderfully talking about the pressures of "how to carry yourself in the world" as an artist. In particular, the fact that the distinction or the separation between art and life, professional and personal evaporate within the arts (from creators to art professionals) would be a generous source of tension.One question that crosses my mind: how much of this is penetrating within the non-creative spheres as side-effect of the creative turn, the requirement for creativity, the curated self, etc.?By way of conclusion - I'm 30 now and I've been practicing self-deceit and strategic thinking, in turns, for more than 5 years now. Reading your story, Alberto (thanks a lot @Noemi for the introduction, that was quite a read!), worries me that I have some time left for at least one shift ;)
Yeah - I can very well imagine the arguments (everybody has a slightly different background, experience, perspective, and very little time to communicate). Thanks a lot for being there for everyone though!Let me think out loud about the list a little.You need to give a lot of information in very little time. It is important that it can be understood quickly. It is also important that people understand why some things are better than other things. Here is what I would try:Try to use a combination of images and text, a little like a meme. The image is most important (says more than 1000 words) and will ideally explain most of the things that have been discussed in many hours before. Ideally the people who are really deep into the topic do a thorough image search and you pool them together, and then photoshop or redraw. Of course one image (even if it is very good) can't explain everything, that is why you need a little text (english, greek, arabic probably). Similar to this (called "exploded view) or this (but so you can photocopy it - so brighter and increased contrast) or this (the words explain the "why" not the item, if it is too difficult use another illustration). You may want to have one page for as a sort of inventory and one page as a sort of manual (e.g. there is a lot you can do with the space blanket that needs a little extra info (maybe Lizzie could also check the list?)).Some more things I thought of:- It is much easier to get kids to wash their hands while they play with something. Small pebbles or pearls also rub the hands so they get cleaned much better. Kids are big bacteria spreaders. More on hygiene. You can make a sink with the space blanket and duct tape, or an old plastic ice cream package (1L weighs 30g).- for washing clothes you can use the space blanket.- I would recommend 3 (ziplock?) plastic bags with sugar (perhaps with stevia - more weight efficient), salt, and a piece of soap. One bag big enough for this hot water "bottle". Heating or use hot rock or sand.- sterile saline solution (smallest possible), if you need more desinfected water, you can also boil- a comb (or just half)- vasiline (part for real use, but more for "magic cream" placebo effect)- kids earplugs (use alcohol to desinfect!), probably smart to tie in a piece of string for safety.- antiseptic wipes (can be "refilled" with alcohol)- in terms of clothes I would try to reduce cotton. Wool is fine for warmth if you have a windbreaker, if you can have at least one set of synthetic undergarments as they dry much faster than cotton.- personally I love wool leg warmers combined with short wool socks in the outdoors. Socks can be swapped and kept dry without much extra weight. The warmers can be regulated while walking and can be also used in many different ways. I'm not sure if they work well for kids though.
Georgi, here is Alberto's story as an economist turned musician turned policy expert. Pretty savory :-)I don't know if market skewness explains it all - it certainly makes sense. But from what people are saying here, it also has to do with professional identity and some ideas attached to it telling you what you should do as an artist or how to carry yourself in the world -which creates anxiety.
Nice to meet you @Tree of Life! I just came across this piece, and funny I am thinking along those lines too these days, as during a community dinner in my hometown (FoodWaste project) I realised (again!) how cheap volunteering can be.. even in terms of that valuable time you mention. How do parents make this leap from being busy raising their child to working for greater community benefits - that also help raise their child, but not so obvious for many perhaps..
Hello, @Georgiana B.  , and welcome. I don't think I have read anything by you before. You make some excellent points, particularly that of artists sharing some of those stress-inducing working conditions with non-artists. You mention art workers; where I come from (Italy) there is similar talk around freelancers. Trained as an economist, having been a professional musician for several years in the 1990s, I looked up economic literature about the arts. The intuition most relevant to your point (and the whole thread) is this: art is defined by economies of scale in consumption. It works like this. Imagine you like classic two guitars-bass-drums rock music. Well, that technology scales really well: you can enjoy a rock concert in a bar with an audience of 30 people, or in a football stadium with an audience of 80,000. The costs of giving a concert increases in the size of the audience, but much slower than the ticket revenues. If you double your audience, your profit does not double: it goes up fourfold, or even tenfold, depends on where you start. Markets with these characteristics are called winner-takes-it-all: they produce few superstars, with everyone else doing badly (Rosen's classic 1981 paper). While stars tend to be very talented people, it is simple to build a model that takes performers with identical characteristics, and then makes one or a few of them superstars, and discards the others. Initial lucky breaks are reinforced by the success-breeds-success dynamics. We need a hairdresser every ten blocks, because people go to different hairdressers. But very few stars, because we all watch/listen to/read the same ones.Now, you really do not want to work in a labour market that makes superstars. Whoever you are, probability says that you are almost certainly a loser in the race. That's extremely stress inducing. But artists do work there. And so do others, as you point out. Tentative conclusion. Maybe it's not creativity that is stressful: it's the characteristics of winner-takes-it-all labor markets, including the one for artists. Implications: hard call. I fully appreciate that being creative in your spare time is limiting. But so is being poor, scared and stressed out. My own choice was relatively easy, given that I was obviously no artistic genius, and other things interested me just as much as music: I got the hell out of it after making it to midlevel (gold record in a secondary market such as Italy), but not to stardom :-)
Great work @alkasem23 . Very insightful. It has potential to be one of the better posts on Edgeryders yet. Small thing: this would be even better if we clarified some parts of the translation (what does it mean to "put the platforms in the service of semiconductor scientists and intellectuals"?). If you are up for it, we could organize a call between and someone who speaks both Arabic and English. This will make this post into a powerful testimony. What do you say?
Hi everyone.I can only speak for the contemporary art scene, which is the one I’m part of and not for theatre or other subdomains of the creative field. I see two main directions in the discussion so far.First, there’s the question of creativity and anxiety being intertwined, and how to identify the moment when this anxiety crosses over to a dangerous zone for the artist; also, if this link is a given, how would we go about trying to keep an artist in the safety zone without hindering the creative dimension. Going back to what has been noted so far, the idea of the artist as troubled soul is rooted in the romantic definition of the artist, which I think has long been overcome within contemporary art (and made room for other sources of angst). Nevertheless, apart from this dated, unhealthy perspective, there might be an actual connection between the artistic predisposition and emotional volatility. I haven’t read any studies on this topic, though I suppose this is a strong area of research and only after making sense of the results we might be able to think of strategies for improvement. These might be seen as issues concerning the psychology of arts, which I’m not at all familiar with.Then, there is the layer of high (or higher?) anxiety levels within the art world as a result of the pressures of the specific field. Here I’m referring to aspects that could be integrated within the sociology of arts (which I have more understanding of) like rampant competition, status issues (the art world is strongly hierarchical), precarious living/working conditions, high levels of uncertainty (not only of day to day life but the artist’s own sense of identity as an artist), market/ commercialization contamination and so on.At one point in his article The Curatorial Muse, Michael J. Kowalski writes: “It is acknowledged, though not often discussed in polite company until the third drink, that the arts are defined by the same Darwinian savagery as any another profession. It is also acknowledged that the aspiration of art to beauty and truth is a pious fiction, but in the best possible sense of the word. Finally, and crucially, it's acknowledged that these two characteristics of art are seriously and permanently at odds with one another”. - (http://www.contempaesthetics.org)One important idea here is to note that these are not concerning artists only, but art workers in general. It’s difficult for me to say if the levels of anxiety are higher in art that in other professions. A good point was made earlier that these might be found in any other field. My impression is, though, that fields in which creativity is profoundly linked with identity will always make for a more stressful environment. And for those that already identify with the psichological pressures of creativity, this later layer might be just too much to handle.Just a few more personal notes: in my discussions with artists I found that many drop out from University because they can’t take the pressure. It might be helpful to note that the myth of the emergent artist will bring the issues I identified before as pertaining to the sociology of art very early on in an artist’s life – from the first years of university. This young age, one that is related to learning, experimenting, trial and error, finding one’s path etc., has become a battlefield for launching careers. (My one experience brings this even earlier in life, being a child and a teenager trying to become a professional musician. I am one of those who could not handle the difficulties of a musical career at such an early stage in my life and lacking a good support system, so I quit. At present I work as a passionate art professional - curating, arts management, teaching, cultural PR - and I find the field highly demanding, but I feel I have more resources in myself to work my way through, than I did when I was a young musician.)Another key point in artists’ lives that my friends who are painters pointed out to me is finishing their studies and trying to make a living through their art and not make compromises. The attention to each decision is overwhelming for most young artists: they need to make a living but most of the times their options put them in a compromising position they know they might not recover from, the art world being so much about reputation management and legitimation. Whenever I think of the contemporary art world I have in my mind the picture of a chess board. One needs to learn the rules of the game by playing, and you only get one round.The other day I was listening to Sarah Thornton, a sociologist of art who was pointing out that ever since Duchamp, the freedom of the artist to fashion herself as an artist is a demigod position that puts a lot of pressure especially on artists finishing studies, whom are very much aware of the responsibility of designating themselves as artists. Many would not use the word artist, Thornton notes, and when asked what they do, they say “I do work…”Of course, older age comes with its own anxieties within the arts, namely the obsession with youth...But to conclude, I’d say that once clarified what aspects you guys are more interested in working with, there would be specific/ specialized ways to enable care and help. It might be that it is not even relevant if the creative field is more prone to anxiety than others, but wanting to reduce these big emotional costs would require a particular approach, one that suits the idiosyncrasies of the field. I’d be very interested to contribute within my own area of knowledge and experience - I say there’s a strong need for open care structures here. 
The guy wearing the shirt is Nicu, he was actually the chef coordinating everyone :-)Regularity also means lowering coordination as you fall into some clear processes - now a lot of the time has gone into thinking about the concept, drafting invites etc. All this would be taken care of in future events.. But the people who seamlessly make stuff happen - like Cami aka Ponyo, or @Natalia Skoczylas  or @Yannick from what I know :P are very precious.Once you have the building blocks, stepping into a friendly strucure is much easier.  I surprised myself thinking about how cheap it is to be part of stuff like this:Volunteering semi-anonymously is great. In this age and in the knowledge economy, I hardly know any people who don’t have an organisation or a project that’s their official “baby”. Everybody is a co-founder of something. So being able to squeeze great work in between one’s official hats makes for quite a breathing space. If we could all volunteer 2-3 hours for someone’s project with no agenda whatsoever it would be so much easier to barnraise around highly ambitious things. You don’t have to be an expert on food or run a civic organisation to claim a say in a pressing issue - the issue is 100% unresolved and no one can claim authority on it.. so: blank slate to experiment! 
Wow, excellent stuff! And, as a native of Emilia Romagna, I really want the "Praise the Lard" T-shirt the guy at the center of the photo is wearing.More seriously: this does sound as something that could be repeated, and possibly even made permanent or semi-permanent. The scarce resource is, as always, the conveners: the people who would bother to email and call and put up the wiki and phone the local supermarket manager who is happy to help but would definitely not get on the wiki or the Google group... even for you, it's fun to get out and do this, but will it still be fun next year if you do it every Saturday? What other fun things will you have to forego in order to do this? I wonder if @janetgunter might have some wisdom to share from the Repair Project. 
Hi again @Shajara! I was reading this article and thought you might find it informative - results from a study on Irish students from 22 universities saying that a third go through mental distress and less than 1 in 4 look for support. So worrying. I'm now trying to get hold of the original study.A mental health community initiative in Ireland that we know of is Cosain - a an organic healing centre by peers of all ages, running as a prototype in the city museum! - curious what you think.Also new in the conversation since you were last online - a volunteer led organisation running twitter chats on mental health. Definitely check them out, maybe you can do something together as they are always looking for hosts!
Hei @Simonedb, with @Alberto we're going to be in Milano end of the month - probably there on the 27th. I would love to come visit you at the house, or even meet up in the city, maybe a dinner with other community members? Let me know if you're free those days? Sunday 27th or afternoons during the week days (28, 29)? You know my email :P
As I'm not in Greece and my only contacts there are those you met already here on Edgeryders, I did the simplest thing and donated. But will keep on spreading the word, and looking forward to your eBook! Safe travels, Ybe.
Hey @samadhi.0110 and @pjones, it's been a while and in the meantime mental health became quite a topic here in OpenCare, with many people showing interest and sharing their work. You might find interesting what WeMentalHealthNurses are doing as they bring people on twitter to discuss topics of interest for both caregivers and patients, and refine the idea of MH nursing in a very dynamic community.  Just a thought, hope your work is progressing? 
Enchante, @MaisonDuPeuple (un username très inspiré :)Y a-t-il une partie du bâtiment Bourse qui n'est pas actuellement utilisée? Pourquoi avez-vous pensé à celui-là en particulier? C'est vrai, chaque fois que je suis à Bruxelles je vois beaucoup de mouvement de rue dans la zone, pour ainsi dire (rue piétonne, danseurs de rue etc). Est-ce que c'est ca la raison?
Potential info or participation:http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/ethnologie/personenliste/voss/index.html  / https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin_Voss3andhttp://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.katastrophennetz.de%2FI would expect they could also point out funding opportunities. Perhaps one could divert some anti-terror money to useful activities in resilience?A simple way would be to coordinate with some of them: http://wordpress.katastrophennetz.de/masterstudiengaenge/ for a master thesis project.He was in charge of "cross border support workshop"  (I'll update if I find something English, this is Austrian-German), and works with the gov civil protection.
I've used this opportunity to dig into some of the recent German gov publications on such issues, and it turns out that ."Die Kommunikation mit der Bevölkerung ist in Deutschland aktuell nicht Bestandteil von Notfallschutz-Übungen.In den zuständigen Behörden liegen in den meisten Fällen keine Krisenkommunikationskonzepte vor. Kommunika-tion über soziale Medien wird bisher nur unzureichend berücksichtigt.""Communication with the population in Germany is currently not part of emergency response exercises. In the competent authorities, there are in most cases no crisis communication concepts. Communication on social media has so far only been inadequately addressed." (this comes from the radiation guys who are somewhat important historically).Also they see the need to coordinate better within the EU as quite simple events (big fire, toxic chemicals released) can overwhelm national stockpiles easily - especially if there were a series of such events. So if the event you plan could include this as a facet, then I think this could be potentially be budgeted. Also, here is a German centered (intl at bottom) list of emergency reaction organizations (mostly centered around "Civil Protection") and some other relevant organizations. If your event allows for it, I could try and see if there are a few that would be interested in dialing in and listening to how your discussion is going. Perhaps they could also answer some questions that may come up.
I agree that long lists and texts aren't very helpful most of the time (although there may be exceptions, like cities under siege, certain diseases, etc.).If you want to integrate activities that help prepare yourself for an acute or creeping emergency I think in many ways going camping, hiking, or something like the boy scouts are helpful to get people started. Basically you get used to the idea of getting by with less infrastructure. This of course does not address the myriad of other issues you may be facing, which can require quite different preparations.That is in part why I looked at ways of short term organization and info dissemination. The other thing that would be helpful and perhaps realistic for some poeple at least is to try to be able to provide a useful service during such emergencies.I would not want to dismiss methods from the past completely. Certainly many of them don't work very well, may be blindsided, or out of touch with realities. So I agree one should not accept them as last word on the issues (and note I may sound more drastic on this if I had seen official approach fail on the Greek Islands for months) - there sure is a necessity for trying out new things. Still official policies often have some useful elements to them (also depends on how far into the past one wants to look).
I enjoyed reading your well written post @steelweaver ! I have a rich medical history and although I had a brief run in with acupuncture, I never really went for it. I'd still like try it out when the opportunity presents itself.It's an interesting remark on the authority of health practitioners @steelweaver and @Noemi . I think the reliance on guidance by an expert is in large part the result of the patients not being as familiar with acupuncture as the expert. Yet patients are there for a reason: at some level, they believe in the positive potential of the treatment. This common belief of both parties is the base for authority and lends you, or the practitioner, as an expert the authority to give direction. Authority governs the interaction and when nobody (or nothing) assumes it, confusion arises. To be clear: authority is different from power.I can complement this with my personal experience in the standard healthcare system in Belgium. For a little over 5 years I had a series of serious physical afflictions, which didn't ever seem to heal or resolve themselves and only got worse over the years. At the start I always left the clinic with a smile, which always disappeared in days, weeks or months as the situation deteriorated again. I experienced first hand that I was just a number, and that treating symptoms is faster and easier. Good thing for pharma companies, because endlessly treating symptoms sells more drugs. Finding the real cause takes longer, is harder and is more expensive, at least in the short term.I got pretty skeptical about the system by going from doctor to doctor and spending more time in physiotherapy than with my friends or family. Gradually I lost belief in the system. It was after I ultimately found the cause and cure (very simple ones at that) that whatever remained of my belief vanished. With that gone, there was no more common belief between me and the doctor, so the authority vanished. My language can't hide it: I found the solution, not a doctor or a system. For this specific illness, I will not lend authority very easily anymore either. I'm lucky, as I have a general idea of healthcare through my studies and know my body well by now, but this is clearly problematic for the general population when you hear similar stories with unhappy endings.Also interesting that (at least for me) a big part of the authority of the health practitioner is due to belief in the system, rather than a belief in the knowledge of the doctor (which I never really doubted). I think that might be a western thing, linked to what surfaced in the discussions with @alkasem23 about differences in care with Syria: in the west we put our trust in and rely on systems rather than other people. In some other cultures, people probably put their belief mainly in a person, the doctor.Easier interactions through the internet, powerful search engines, a lot of people sharing experience and stories online, easy access to second opinions (in my country anyway)... Though they don't always provide correct information, these factors also lead people to challenge the authority in terms of knowledge of the practitioner in the classical doctor's office. I think both this challenging of knowledge and the failure of the system will inevitably lead to some fundamental changes in healthcare.Importantly, authority cannot simply disappear, the common belief has to shift to something else. Most stories of experimentation with new methods in the stories here on Edgeryders share some sort of community aspect. This illustrates a shift to lending authority to a collective rather than a system or a person. The collective can consist of patients, doctors or other caregivers and is likely a mixture ideally. In Syria the collective is mainly the family, according to Alkasem.Looking through this lens of authority is interesting and can be applied to many aspects of our daily lives. The matter is fresh in my head from a Dutch book I just finished reading, which I hope gets translated to English. If anyone is interested: the book builds on work by Hannah Arendt that you can certainly find :-)
I think it's useless to repeat methods from the past. We have to think out of the box and create new ways of reaction. We can use all this survival kit lists just for wring/sift and/or update them. The point is not an endless list that nobody wants to read it but to find ways to train the people through their daily routines. And only a few things should be prepared especially for emergencies.
- Thermosflask improvements (big & glass)- Hot air pump for sleeping bag
Of course with some different focus groups and cases, but "The Citizen" does not exist. So what I'd think is crucial is the presentation format and delivery method.For example after a catastrophy (or on the march) very few people will have the time to read about it in Red Cross or USAid pdfs even though they would probably remember critical things much better than in a classroom. Some can understand scientific papers, and others cannot read. Generally, if you want to be prepared you need to invest some time into practicing or reading e.g. "Where there is no Doctor", or stocking some tools or supplies before shit hits the fan. Not many people are ready to do that. It is much less glamorous than posing with big guns and other stuff. Often people (correctly) feel it is unlikely that they would get a return on investment for their effort. Also, crises affect different regions (e.g. climate) in different ways, in those regions e.g. urban areas will be affected differently from rural, in those places different people (age, occupation, gender, minority) will again be affected differently in short to long term.Most documents I know are written in a linear fashion, either for "the general populace" or authorities, or a few select critcal professions. Research articles in the field are often a bit better (if you can get them and understand them) as they show more of the detail under the hood. There is quite a bit out there in English, German, and I am sure French language. I would expect that other languages can be a very mixed bag.Interestingly almost none of the materials I know are intended for reproduction and dissemination (perhaps modification) in the field, which I think is a critical shortcoming. Economically you often cannot but be largely unprepared for low frequency large impact events. If you could could start quickly copy-pasting stuff from a relatively few seeds once the event has come to pass, you would very quickly be able to deliver information and organize action far better.I think the most realistic forms of reproduction in the field are (including grid down, excluding perhaps nuclear EMP scenarios):- Copies via smart phone, either onto micro-sd card or using e.g. bluetooth file transfer.- Recording of spoken/played material via phone, perhaps eventually put into writing.- Pencil/coal stick/copy machine copies of simple illustrations/heuristics/nmemonics/ not more than a few lines in most cases.My suggestion would be a less linear and mostly digital collection of material (even if the grid will be down it will be relatively easy to charge a smartphone/tablet/etc from solar or car batteries). Ideally most of it can be accessed through different lenses - weighing urgent vs important, for the specific "type" of audience, in a (or several) appropriate formats. On the latter point I would strongly recommend inlcuding something that is audio based with separate illustrations (and check lists, e.g. in playing card deck, or digitally as "album art" format) and incremental navigation (e.g. if you need to know more on this topic press forward 9 times and you hear the announcement "xyz"). An audio lecture then could be made up of a summary of 1. the most important things to know in a hurry, 2. the main content, 3. mnemonic take aways to repeat to yourself.Audio has the advantages that you do not need to drop everything you're doing, you can do it while walking, and you can do it in the dark.If you use 64kbps (clear spoken language) mono mp3 audio you need approximately 1 MB for every 2 minutes. If we assume 24h of spoken material that would be 720 MB. This fits into almost every memory card (or CD), mp3 player and can be copied using bluetooth version 3 in 5 minutes, and version 2 in 30 minutes. The most important things everyone needs to know should probably be available in different languages but be only 3-15 minutes in duration. Additional material can be provided in ebook format (which can be referenced in the audio) with very little space required.My schematic in the other comment is an example for non-digital content that can also be reproduced in the field, when you actually have demand. It could also be airdropped as leaflets of course.I wanted to make a heuristic approach to re-establish some skeletal form of organization which can catalyze coopreration (especially in the 48h hours of pro-social behavior mostly observed after an acute catastrophe). I thought this is necessary because very often there exists no effective interface to the local society that the "professional care & aid circus" can dock into, and many of the respective group's fuck-ups would be easier to avoid if there was such an interface. The idea is to establish channels on the ground within the local community which accumulate, curate (discuss), and disseminate critical information. Those information dense hubs can relatively easily be found and interfaced with the professionals. If the crises do not have a clear onset like an earthquale or flood, but is more creeping other approaches may be more effective though.The implied understanding that may motivate people is the following: Doing difficult situations alone is usually not a good idea*. Put 20% into helping each other, and if the majority survives you'll probably be among them.The simplified instructions: 1 of 5 connects and helps to coordinate. 1 in 5 helps to coordinate coordinators. Information must flow in both directions fast, and critical aspects need to be documented.Make a group in which you will quickly be able to trust, care, and communicate (so about 5). Then make groups of groups and dedicate 10-20% of your resources to communication & cooperation, about half "upwards" and half "downwards".*Something that rarely gets enough attention when you superficially glance at the prepper scene. Alone you are probably prey to your own stupidity, germs, or pack hunters. Your gun does not help when you are sleeping.
It wasn't meant as suggestion. :)
do we think that we could find a funding agency willing to cover some of the costs related to pulling this project together?I look around and see many people on here who have 1st hand experience of dealing with crisies and disasters around the globe. I assume all of us could reach out to at least 2 or 3 major organisations who would be interested in contributing to a large scale  useful project like this.i wonder if we could approach an organisation like Wellcome Trust as a humanities/health cross over project? What do you think @Bridget McKenzie? Would this be fundable if we polished up the process and deliverable ideas?
This guide is one of the reasons I decided to establish the assosiation "Cosmus diy" (the bureaucracy part). Most of the people here have experience at Idomeni and still have at the camps. But I think it must be more wide. Not only about the refugees' wave or about a specific place/country. Maybe a few things can be the same but every place should have a diffirent guide. And then we can map and add people and skills or knowlenge.I also have an idea about the clothing problem and how we can do "smart balls" with clothes anywhere This is more complicated and I think it needs a video.
Thessaloniki or a Greek island is better choice because people are more involved. And don't forget that is the project I 'm running now. So why, in Athens?
In terms of earthquake and emergency response. But I agree Italy and Greece are too.I've toyed a lot with the idea of having two-stage events, where the travel becomes part of the (optional) first stage. For example if we meet somewhere in/around Athens for the second stage, you can have a distributed first stage start in Izmir (and continue on the ferry to Athens), or on/around some of the airports that fly into Athens (may not be the best example as air travel is very fractured time, unlike train or ferry). Just a thought. Alternatively one could try to do 1-2 prior hangouts where we use Edgesense (and of course human input) to either stirr the pot, or find close matches (as people prefer). If feel like meetings can be far more helpful if we already warm people up beforehand and not go in "cold turkey". Also, people who cannot attend physically can still help with the hangout organizaton - and can try to partner up with an "agent" who will be attending physically.
This kind of input really is helpful and i can already see a 'Citizens guide to supporting people in an emergency' style document that contains these kinds of ideas and responces.They key will be to get lots of people who have experience of working with refugees already, together with lots of people who have useful experience from other areas of life. Then both sides can bounce off each other.I still think that a hackathon like this would be best suited to taking place in Greece or Italy, where the incoming flow is still increasing and there is a high likelihood that another disaster may occur (i'm thinking about the recent Italian Earthquakes). 
This is why it needs to press the smart mode button.
No problem! Anytime it;s ok!aravellasalonik@gmail.com  skype aravella1717
Talk about a slow revolution! It makes sense to me that we're hardwired to take univocal instructions more seriously, it shows that the doctor is not doubting his approach.Patient-doctor dynamics in healthcare is probably cultural too - we've heard stories from China where ambivalence or open endedness in medical consultations inspired fear more than confidence.   
This.@Alex Levene this is the kind of question and expert input or exchange we'd want at the hackathon to support refugees in Jan/ Feb!! It's pretty awesome, and imagine including all these kinds of info in a curated, structured document for any given question! 
It's great to see you ladies @ybe and @Aravella Salonikidou scheme! I am sure your meeting will be a great success.
Like this!
@trythis thank you! I 'll study all these carefully! We don' t do backpacks for the refugees anymore so we focus to backpacks that we can prepare for ourselves or other people and keep them for an emergency. So, we have to think about many diffirent things. For the refugees I've done this:But this is a draft. It needs something professional with the same style in a platform on line. When somebody wants to prepare a backpack could use specific items and also a list with more details for its item. What is this? How to use it e.t.c.
Thanks, @Rune.Yes, I think there could be some very interesting cross-over with the WeHandU-type approach. Notwithstanding what I said in reply to @Alberto below about the need to retain a degree of 'expert-pateint' hierarchy, I am very interested in exploring the prospects for more collaborative healing.Indeed, the nature of Traditional East Asian Medicine is very collaborative already - patients can be given exercises to do, dietary changes, self-moxa kits, or herbal teas that all supplement and reinforce the acupuncture treatment, meaning that they are far more involved in their own journey back to wellness.One idea I had was to supplement the clinic with a once-a-week 'Moxa Club' where people could come and learn to safely use moxa on each other. Many more people could be treated simultaneously than is possible with just one acupuncturist; if partners, friends or family came together, they could then continue treatments at home; and the overall message - that people should be learning the skills to keep themselves healthy - would be inherent in the model.The BAcC is actually moving funding towards Proof-of-Concept studies for 2017; there might be some scope for creating a project that combined different aspects of Opencare in this sort of way.
Sure - the venue I was in had a lot of character, but also a steep staircase and difficulties in heating it sufficiently. Turns out there is a community centre on the other side of town that already has a lot of people passing through doing interesting community things. So I'm moving there for ease of access, easier parking and the synergies with other projects.I was doing the clinic during the day, but a lot of people had problems getting childcare or said they could not come because of their working hours, so I am thinking I will run it from the afternoon into the evening instead, to give people a chance to come along who otherwise couldn't. The other option would be Saturday morning, which would certainly get people in.There's also a good chance I will be combining forces with a western herbalism school, who will ahve student herbalists prescribing herbs under supervision in the same venue.How my treatments have changed is a little more subtle - one unexpected area is that I was previously attempting to be very 'collaborative' in my treatment style, not pushing people to commit to treatments unless they were self-motivated to do so, leaving it open for them to decide how deep they wanted to go with lifestyle changes etc.But it turns out that people actually want a bit more guidance / authority than that - perhaps this is just the legacy of hierarchical healthcare, that they feel more comfortable with a model that they are familiar with, or perhaps it is actually a greater part of being a therapist than I previously considered; that the nature of therapy is such that you need to have a degree of authority for the patient to productively assimilate the treatment. This obviously raises interesting questions about some of the 'horizontalist' projects featured in Opencare!
for your suggestion and here's the link again http://www.traumatour.eu/2016/09/30/to-thessaloniki-and-back/ and also this one http://www.traumatour.eu/2016/11/01/last-call/
Strongly scented soap, rosewater, essential oil (careful with skin contact) on a scarf dipped maybe mixed with vasiline could could produce a pleasent or at least effectively masking smell.Vicks VapoRub supposedly also works as mosquito repellent, as well as medical uses.If you have small things that small you could fix them with a safety pin.Especially for women I could imagine the opposite could also be helpful in some situations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stink_bombhttps://www.amazon.com/Stink-Bombs-42-0003-12-Boxes/dp/B001MKRQBS/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1478185871&sr=8-5&keywords=stink+b...
They ran the SOPs (but did not factor in that Nepal is hard to get to/around in) so a lot of dogs were flown in to look for people under the rubble who had mostly perished by the time the dogs came. While they were walking their dogs in Kathmandu you really needed water treatment - absence of which can quickly lead to a loss of life that drawfs the ones they might have pulled from the rubble. Fortunately that did come before epidemics happened.At the same time citizens were either sitting under tarps in the rain, complaining about a lack of water (while not catching the rainwater!), or standing in very long lines at the government water truck that could only serve 1 person at a time because no one had thought of a manifold.
If you want to upscale cost effectively you may have to look outside of the traditional materials selections. Something that is durable and available at large scale is Tyvek. I have an outer layer for a sleeping bag to make it rainproof which I suspect is of very similar material.For (DIY) backpacks which hold a little more here is an interesting channel: https://youtu.be/q8j051J51O8?list=PLZLagqylZ3j6bLG7hwcwE28Max5Kd9ZE-&t=564 this specific version may also work with the inline skate rolls without too much work.Regarding organization I had some thoughts (but mostly focused on immediately after a disaster) which may be more helpful for the refugees to get a little more organized (and perhaps interface with you better). It is a heuristic approach, so it is not intended to produce the optimal or ideal result - but to be reliably better than nothing, and it is mostly information focused. 
I often recommend digital grieving. I kknow a number of sites that 'help' people grieving by providing nformation, testimonials, sharing stories, proposing  exercices or rituals,... I think it is a great tool, especially for youngsters - since 'being online' is almost natural to them.Also, for persons with few ressources, who feel very lonely, the internet, 'a digital community' is often their only link to the outside world. And their very first attempts in meeting and going into this outside world. 
My mother is now fairly old (she was born in 1937). Women in the family seem to have good genes, though, and she, her two sisters and some female cousins in their late 70s and early 80s are still quite formidable. They are also close to one another. So, my mum does have another option, which is to move in with her sisters. This is not as crazy as it might sound, because by pooling their forces they can hold out much longer than each one of them in isolation. Also, they would probably find this psychologically less disempowering than having to fall back on us, because they would help each other rather than being only on the receiving side. Like in John's description, my mother and her sisters and cousins are fiercely independent and would absolutely loathe becoming dependent, even on us. 
I think you would enjoy this @careday-team. I re-read it and thought of your angle, which allows for many explorations left and right: an article making a case that most of the work people do is on each other! so care work is just too unseen and mostly in underpriviledged jobs, genders to a minimum. Working classes as care classes, that's a strange idea that never occured to me:Even in the days of Karl Marx or Charles Dickens, working-class neighbourhoods housed far more maids, bootblacks, dustmen, cooks, nurses, cabbies, schoolteachers, prostitutes and costermongers than employees in coal mines, textile mills or iron foundries. All the more so today. What we think of as archetypally women's work – looking after people, seeing to their wants and needs, explaining, reassuring, anticipating what the boss wants or is thinking, not to mention caring for, monitoring, and maintaining plants, animals, machines, and other objects – accounts for a far greater proportion of what working-class people do when they're working than hammering, carving, hoisting, or harvesting things.This is true not only because most working-class people are women (since most people in general are women), but because we have a skewed view even of what men do. As striking tube workers recently had to explain to indignant commuters, "ticket takers" don't in fact spend most of their time taking tickets: they spend most of their time explaining things, fixing things, finding lost children, and taking care of the old, sick and confused.Caring too much. That's the curse of the working classes.
Socialization is the elephant in the room and teenagers are in no mans landWell, this is for sure. I guess our school system was designed in a context where socialization happened outside the school and peer structures were robust. And maybe they are not that robust anymore, and anyway teenagers have very little time. This, by the way, is danah boyd's take on teens and social media in It's complicated: families saturate teenagers time with what she calls adult-approved activities, and they escape into social media to Just Hang Out. 
I don't find what you say nihilist at all @Alberto , and I agree with your observations. Education is above all a human relationship, in fact a proxy of parental relationships. And it works better when the involved humans are intrinsically motivated to pursue it. But there's one more aspect I would like to introduce in my mix: when dealing with teenageers peers are very important, from a world where family and parents are the center they have to evolve to another adult disposition where partners and friends are the center and family can be grown. Socialization is the elephant in the room and teenagers are in no mans land, we are not attending to their needs in this regard.
... if @ybe has found evidence of "digital grieving" in her work on trauma. Might this be a tool? Where the Trauma Tour is going there is going to be a lot of grieving... @wishcrys
Wow, this is really really cool. Have you tried doing ethnography on it? @Amelia what do you think?
Huh... @Aravella Salonikidou , I managed to miss that you are a councillor. So yes, I am very much looking forward to the whole story.In passing: I think we are looking at diversity trumps ability. When an activist-designer-manufacturer like you, a material scientist like @trythis and an open source hacker like @Matthias get on a task, it acquires incredible depth. I am reading your lists and thinking not only "how generous!" but "how clever!" and even "wow, this is cool". :-)
Hey @steelweaver – thanks for this. I went back to your original post: it does explain how you changed your pricing model to adapt it to the CMAC's community. But here you are saying you are also changing the business hours, and even the way you treat.Could you be more specific, especially on the subject of the way you treat? 
@ybe the wish was one of the most important things in the backpack. We didn't send them without the wishes. And it was so powerfull and emotional. You can't imagine what kind of wishes little kids can send! Most of the time my eyes were filled with tears... Thank you for telling us about the poem. Amazing idea!  
@Noemi, thank you for mention @Matthias! I found his post very usefull. More pieces for my puzzle!About the ...hot stuff as an elected person I'll be back tomorrow. I think I have to explain a few things about the reality here in Greece.
@trythis thanks for adding items and tips! The list you see at the post it was only for the open calls. I prefered  to keep it simple so the people could bring things from home as soon as possible. And something else important! Not asking questions! Most of the backpacks included more items and many of them prepared for adults so the list was different. When you gather things for the crowd it's more complicate than it seems. The people want to help but very often the misunderstand  the announcements and they want to ask for details. About months I was on line (every line!) nearly 24h. For example they could understand why we asked for plastic crocs style (I avoided the word "crocs" and use the word "clogs" because many people thought I'm trying to advertise them). Especially for this, a woman from a "...welcome" team laught at me and insult me in public. She told me that these type is useless when crossing the european rivers and she refused to share the posts if i didn't ask for rain boots or athletic shoes. I wasted (or maybe not) about an hour to explain that this type of shoes are chosen because: it's easy to use them when you want to go to the bathroom at night, to wash your feet, to rest for a while when you have only one pair of shoes for walking, the are light weight, you can hang them out of the backpack, they are cheap e.t.c. So, you see, sometimes it's ....hard to explain...Anyway, the list I have in mind now it's going to be ...peace prepared :) So, I need every tip, tool, trick you know or imagine! We'll keep in touch!
There are some interesting "social" features here. I mean, a GPS is a GPS, but I like the thinking around "guiding" the patient towards low anxiety when caregivers approach (they may not recognize them immediately in unfamiliar surroundings), etc.Did you manage to do a small test yet?
Very interesting, @wave . But there is something I do not understand: it seems you are going through similar projects done in the past and making a list of them. What's next? Do you want to modify and improve them? To make some and have visually impaired people in your own city try them?
I am very moved by your story and I like the idea of including 'a wish' in every backpack so much. It reminds me of this project: https://www.facebook.com/weshallstandforlove/ of a fiend or me in Brussel: Dorothy Oger wrote the poem We shall stand for love in the aftermath of the Brussels terror attacks, and then the poem went viral and was translated in many many languages and now it is distributed for free on postcards with enough space to add a personal message;I allways have the poem with me to pass it on to friends, refugees,...
@steelweaver, I really enjoyed your article. Your reference to denmark made me think of the The Emperor's New Clothes. Are we just renaming old stuff?Id like to discuss Acupuncture more,  could it be integrated in a OpenCare - WeHandU approach?
To your first question, I am not too optimistic. What we're seeing over and over again is that large scale responses needed in these crises situations mostly come about ad hoc and like in Greece, it's citizens who end up training themselves for preparedness. Matthis and co. for example set up this manual for disaster relief management. Is that what you have in mind, but more detailed?But I am still amazed at how you, as an elected municipal councillor in Thessaloniki, prefered to take a step with community as main asset rather than with instruments you had available in your office. Did I get it wrong?
Enlightening take on technology education, I may be quoting you on twitter here and there, just a heads up :-)@Big Bang Schools might add something to this and what Alberto writes - given that they have experience hacking "normal" educational institutions but have also gone on to found a new educational platform with its own type of schools and comprehensive framework. Angelos, I'm curious: which one did you find to be most needed or more effective? 
Thanks for this piece, I am amazed at how optimistic you are @alkasem23.If you can tell us more about the project "Grace Conversation" to share medicine in community it would be great. Or is there anywhere we can go to read about it?
I know some friends who own small business like hardware store and probably interested about this @Noemi. As I mentioned in my article some of us still using woods and charcoal as a combustion. This inventory that @Matthias mentioned in Nepal looks great. It's can avoid a massive destruction of lives and nature. Actually there is no "wasted garbage" here in Madagascar,  there is no specific garbage for glass,paper or plastic here, no recycling program. Nowaday almost 8 of 10 Malagasy people are living under extreme poverty if  we refer to the UN statistics. In 4 years only,  a new cohort of population ( more than 24 %) was falling in extreme poverty. They search inside garbage and rubbish try to find some used bottle and stuff which still sellable. Statistically. It's about 5.6 million of people, more than the people on the capital and some suburban areas. In general, about 18 millions of Malagasy have to get 4 000 Ar per day less than ~ 1, 25 $ /1€ according to the International Pauverty Line. What does such a sum for these very poor household ? Since a kilo of white rice grew 1 200 Ar /20 cent of euro  a bag of charcoal is about 20 000 Ar /5 €,  the scholarship of a child for the 1St grade is about 60 000 Ar / 15€  even in public school this amount is including supplies and other overhead ... Still, nothing concrete is well engaged to alleviate a little bit sufferings of this high proportion of the population.Change begin by everyone of us. 
fully agree with that sentiment. face-to-face produces something tangibly different but equally as powerful as shared 'head space' online
Thanks for your Idea @Nadia, water really Important for some people leaving on South of Madagascar. Where you  need to walk around 30 to 70 km to access to the "nearest "source, It's about 3 times/year of raining. A place between desert and sea.The government haven't find solutions until now. People mix ashes with cactus for eating on dry season,donations and sanitation are more rare than raining in a year. The color of the collectable water is like mustard. Kids with big belly is not fat but undernourished or full of worms called " tenia","ascanis".It's really needs to get top water, some people pay 1€ for one gerican (20 liter) only on market day for it. Teaching sustainable technics is an issue, for me it's a key to overcome this situation. With this Climate Change Impacts, there was a flood on that place a couple years ago, but people didn't think to store water ; We were occupied to save lives and giving hands to the survivors. As @Matthias says nature is impredictable, when it's come you can't prepare for it. 
I may have a nihilistic view, but it seems to me that there is no conclusive evidence for any educational method to be inherently superior to others. The typical story is this: young, smart, charismatic teacher becomes dissatisfied with how things are done in schools. He or she proceeds to start a new school that immediately outperforms the average existing school on all relevant parameters. Maybe the methodology really did the trick. This, however, does not explain why all methodologies seem to work so well: Montessori, Steiner, Ecole 42, home schooling... So, here's another possibility: young, smart, charismatic people who care so much about teaching to leave a secure job to invent their own way of doing it are likely to be better than average teachers. They would do well with any methodology. This would explain at least one case: that of the abandonment of the "notionist" paradigm in the West, supported by solid research results. Children schooled in the new way, more attentive to developing creativity and social skills, outperformed their traditionally schooled peers. But sure enough, 30 years later Western universities were flooded by graduates from very traditional Asian schools, and they kicked the Westerner's asses to kingdom come. It does not make sense that creativity-oriented schooling is both superior and inferior to traditional cramming-oriented schooling. What's going on here could be regression to the mean. If you generalize any methodology to the mainstream you are going to get no more than average results, because this is what happens with average teachers teaching to average learners. I expect that the same will happen to generalized Arduinos in schools. 
I have a background in materials and engineering. I haven't done the trip but I spend time outdoors and walk some good distances with my little one, and often thought about the issue.I would probably add/change (not necessarily for children though):- cordage (e.g. paracord, even dental floss or duct tape can vastly improve temporary shelter, duct tape or other adhesive doubles as band aid), some shock cord (elastic) can also be very helpful.- alcohol for desinfection (e.g. the hand wash gel type)- another space blanket (very little weight high utility especially with some how-to, also good as toy), with your background you might find a way to rig it into a jerven bag like thing.- pieces of sleeping pads, probably sized to be large enough to sit on when folded once, becomes more useful with cordage.- Power for phones: booster for charging from small batteries, buck (alternative) for charging from car battery (1 has enough for 200 phone charges), should probably be ruggedized e.g. by dipping in candle wax.- for kids a hand warmer can help out a lot in increment weather (single use)- at temporary camps a rugged bluetooth speaker could really help the kids unwind- maybe replace the gloves by more socks that can be worn on the hands as well- I would recommend 2 caps (beanies that go over the ear) if you have enough- some water bottles have a special kid friendly openings but attach to regular bottles.- In terms of shoes I think slightly oversize croc style (rooms for woolen socks, or maybe inner soles?) are the best minimum stress options.I am mulling over a system that lets you improvise a "suitcase on wheels" with sticks and cordage. The parts you neet to have of course are the wheels (ideally in pairs, anything from skateboard to scooter will work - they all have 6 mm inner diameter). So this or this would be needed on site. But the two screws that "go in" would have to be replaced by something like 5mm (I think) threaded rod, which would become part of the axle.
I like this idea of neighborhood driven education. In my home town we are also planning a project in this direction, so I will follow these stories with interest :). The correlation between how you teach and what a child learns and ultimately which kind of person it becomes is a hard one. There's so many different opinions on what is the best way of educating and each seems to have its merits. In practise there's already quite some alternatives - at least in Belgium - like Steiner and Freinet schools. My experience with those schools is limited and I have not seen miracles. How does your philospophy relate to the existing alternatives?Like @Noemi says, it's a hard case for radical changes. That's not necessarily a bad thing. There needs to be room for experiment, but education is important enough that we should prevent major failures, even for a small group. The norm will shift slowly as educators themselves learn. I think it's that learning aspect that makes the difference. I hear the saddest stories while working with children. Usually it's educators lacking insight in themselves and their practise, as well as a very static approach to their profession. They are factory workers: follow the protocol, complete the checklist, get good numbers.However, more and more teachers accept change in the form of technological innovation because of this cult-like movement of STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education that is now taking over. I shouldn't complain, I am surfing that wave, but STEM has become a goal in itself. The A of Art is also too often left out of STEAM. The general idea of technological disruption is already rooted in many people's heads, so it's a small jump for people in the educational system to apply it to their field. Lots of schools in Belgium are implementing smart boards, apps, school fablabs etc. without much thought. Just new shiny tools, which in the end are not optimally used because there is no change in mindset. The teachers, the schools etc. rely on technology to avoid changing their behavior. Ironic, because reality is the opposite.We do new biology education and that is our trojan horse: we can hide a new method in the new technological content that we bring. This also means that these changes to the methods won't be too radical. What we do is accepted as a technological innovation, but hopefully the changes in method will add to the slow collective learning process on different methods.
I have one such example and it seems that the more distant relatives or friends posting are trying to support those closest "in rank", albeit from afar. It's almost as if trying to show that they care, maybe for the same reason @Patrick Andrews mentioned - because they don't know how else. "(Mutual) aftercare" is an interesting word I will remember, thank you for introducing it.
Hello again, @Altamirula . Your ideas about the future of learning seem more than reasonable to me, and in fact just yesterday I was at a conference where an educational policy maker kept referencing the idea of schools as learning hubs - questioning how to get there. Those of us in the room thought there's little hope for  a radical makeover, except maybe through public-private partnerships - if you do like TOPIO in Greece - the girls in Thessaloniki do neighborhood youth empowerment through artistic expression, pretty beautiful it seems, hav a look?What stage is Future Tools at, can we help in any way? Are you in Spain now? I can't tell from the post..
The theory @ybe has contributted is a very accurate example of the destructive narrative I was talking about in the first place. 
"I am not so sure that things get done in meetings"Ha. You may have a point there! :)I would say, though, that in my experience face-to-face meetings certainly produce different kinds of outcomes than just connecting online - there is a certain kind of trust, enthusiasm, or motivation to collaborate on projects that can suddenly emerge when a group who has only been connecting through screens suddenly share the same real-world space.
Before eventually tapping into desalination, it's best to do proper water management like in this example. Just let sun and rain do the desalination :) Plus, with proper forest cover, rainfall will increase as well, further decreasing the water shortage.It's amazing how much ecosystems can be restored with just a few water management techniques: erosion control, soil buildup, aquifer replenishment. I was a fan of high-tech solutions like desalination just a few years ago, but became more and more convinced we better collaborate with nature where possible. A friend recommended me this documentary about ecosystem restoration on a massive scale (30,000 km² in China).It's not that humanity is out of solutions. The problem is, as always, about spreading knowledge and organizing collective action on a massive scale. That's why I like that @Michel focuses on the education part. Yet nobody has cracked the collective action problem yet (and not just because we're up against strong capitalist "collective destruction") …
Had forgotten I met Biplab a couple of years ago. He was telling me about an approach they had developed for Gujarat (India).The way it works is ver simple: they pierce the ground with thin funnels that "suck in" water from the surface and stores it in an underground reservoir (during the rainy season/floods). So you don't get salt deposits on the topsoil which is the case if rainwater is left standing on it. During the dry season farmers use this reservoir of water to continue farming for up to eight months (according to Bipaul) after rainfall has stopped.The underground reservoir can hold up to 40 million litres of rainwater." Drought is a serious issue in the western Indian state of Gujarat, particularly for underprivileged female farmers whose livelihood depends on the monsoon. Limited rainfall in the state leads to water logging in peak cropping season. For the rest of the year, farmers experience severe water scarcity. But thanks to a life-changing technology, poor farmers are now converting crises into opportunities. Bhungroo is a water management system that injects and stores excess rainfall underground and lifts it out for use in dry spells. "Perhaps the schools could be a good distribution centre, including the building of these reservoirs as part of the childrens science education. Not giving the solution but having them figure out how to do it, with local materials etc. And then teaching their parents and others in the society. @Michel what do you think, could this work?
..is that it lowers the barriers to this type of knowledge. It is about learning and starts with conversations, not therapy, which sounds much heavier and almost like you have to be a "patient" or close to one to access it. Who wants to be a "patient" and can walk in confidently? Probably very few people, or not even those who need it the most. Even the word "trauma" is so heavy that I can see how a friendlier setup and human face can help break the ice. Don't know if it's a strict deontological choice, but you might want to try an experiment where you dont use the word at all in your communication (for example for an event), you'd only use "pain that doesn't go away" or something..Then you explain the proper terminology while at it. Who knows, maybe you get even better results.Thank you for working on this piece Ybe. Quick heads up: your link to the list of things we can help with does not work.. so waiting. With @Nadia and a little luck we might meet you in Greece in December!
@steelweaver , I just wanted to say that your piece on introverts is highly reminescent of @trythis 's own thinking around the same matter. Me, I am not so sure that things get done in meetings, nor that real world meetings are more likely to lead to real world actions. But your point stands: collaboration environments that are friendly to introverts are a good thing.
Not aware of any silver bullet re desal. Different options exist but most need lots of energy. Check Australia for viable approaches. The may be less centralzed options using air dehumidification (israeli tech?). You can also evaporate and chatch the "distilled" water - but you still need lots of energy (which possibly could come from desertec style overproduction). So instead of charging batteries you charge your cistern. Another issue is cost effective and clean transportation/distribution. There is a reason mankind mostly spread along rivers for a very long time. 
What an interesting discussion, thx to you all. I agree that stress and suffering are part of life @Noemi @odin @Alberto, that stress to some degree even make us thrive, grow @steelweaver. But in the end stress should not become bigger than our coping skills, it should not be overwhelmingly disturbing. In general, I think of art and creativity as an expression of oneself, an expression of our inner world, our 'being' in the world, our being 'me'. Being authentic is by definition being different from others and thus coping with judgment,  the others , the outer world goes along with it.But I also think that feeling different, an outsider, more sensitive than others, etc etc .. is often a 'symptom' of trauma, a result of not having our needs met in the past f.ex, wich often results in losing our own connection with our needs, our connection with ourself.  This disconnection is trauma, the residu of pain. In my vision many artists are trying to 'heal' themselves through their art - redefine themselves, trying to find a way to become 'whole' again - integrate pain and trauma. Artists are often 'self-healers', they are their own therapists.When the self-healing fails, they might consider exploring the pain and trauma trough different glasses - those of a therapist. Thinking out of the box could help them cope better :-)This is the more or less classic, freudian, psychological explanation for 'artistic pain'.There is another explanation though, one that is defended by one of the founding fathers of expressive arts therapy S.K. Levine : that art is the expression of our soul, our 'acorn', that we are born with a 'mission', something we want to express, and that the struggle to discover and express this acorn, this individual mission causes pain. Levine thinks we overfocus on pain and trauma caused by environment/youth/parents... We should instead in therapy look more for 'the inborn authenticity, the inborn self'.(If interesetd in this latter explanation: See Stephen K. Levine: Trauma, Tragedy, Therapy: the Arts of human suffering (quite a philosophical, demanding book - but very interesting out of the box view for therapists ;-))Hope this helsp as a theoretical frame @PaulineYbe

I read that one of the most pressing issues is the water crisis. Before anything else can work I suppose this is one key issue that needs to be addressed. A question is if there is a cheap desalination technology that could be applied at scale in one area, and then build on that. I'm asking around, but perhaps others. @trythis might know?Recently I came across an article that points out a lot of practical advice for building livelihoods. But most of it is probably not applicable outside the US/Europe. That said here it is:https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/70000-per-year-start-now-kevin-pezzi-md
Maybe @HKaplinsky or @iamkat might be able to add to whether there is an overdose of angst in European artistic thought, practice, socialization.I've also invited an art curator friend of mine to join the discussion, and see what she makes of this.I'm sorry about your dear one. I wonder: if this is so generalized, what support systems are out there for artists then? do artistic collectives or platforms have a contribution to make here or rather more diverse social environments? 
This article on Time explains how women access abortion in Ireland - basically, same as in Poland. It also adds an interesting research on how women feel about abortions after performing them.  "Ninety-four percent of the 1,023 women who completed the at-home abortion said they felt grateful for the option, 97% said at-home mediation abortion was the right choice for them, and 98% said they would recommend the option to other women with unwanted pregnancies.When asked about their feelings after completing the abortion, 70% of the women said they felt relieved, which was the most common sentiment expressed, followed by 35% who said they felt satisfied. “What I think is most striking is that women reported these clear benefits for their health and wellbeing and anatomy,” says Aiken. “I think it really demonstrates that women can make the best choice for themselves when it comes to their own reproduction. The only negative thing about this is that women reported they had to do it against the law, and they went through considerable stress and anxiety and secrecy and isolation and shame.” 
HI @noemi, sorry it took me so long to answer you, I've been traveling. I was trained as an sculptor in Madrid in the '90s and I found artistical education to be deeply rooted in a tradition of irrationality that can be traced to the romantic movement in the 18th century, what is generally presented as the reaction to the enlightenment. I knew I had had enough when a very dear person to me committed suicide. I've had the chance to study and live in the states and in Canada and my experiences in those cultural environments helped me understand other ways to address artistical activities, in a more positive and balanced way. While in Boston I had the great luck to find a sumi-e master that introduced me to the practice of Japanese brush painting, yet another approach to art that includes irrational thought without the angst. I have never developed a theory on all this, but my observations on how the individual artist relates to the society in the different cultures, what is expected of the creative role and how we teach art leads me to think that we in Europe need to overcome this tragical tradition. I wish I could give you more to pull the thead, I really am no expert!
Hello @Michele C , thanks for sharing this. However, it looks like you copy-pasted some kind of promotional text, so that it can be hard for us to understand what's really going on behind the scenes. On the face of it, this can look like a holistic post-school care for rich kids. Can you tell us more as to which care needs you were trying address? Who are your, uh, clients I guess? Why did you feel this was needed?
Fascinating thread.One question that strikes me is: shouldn't this be precisely what art school is about? Providing the freedom to engage deeply with such practices, to experience the emotional fallout of an intense creative life before a job or a commercial project is hanging in the balance?Certainly, this is something you will see at certain drama schools, who combine aspects of psychotherapy with learning to be a good performer - treating the education period as a time to process all the emotional material that surfaces from engaging in the creative practice.Perhaps just being given permission to experience these things and making space to check in with each other and have collective discussion about what is coming up would go a long way to avoiding people feeling that processing emergent emotional material is somehow wrong or unbalanced.This all also reminds me of how important it has been in recent years that people with 'non-ordinary' mental constitutions have been able to find each other and build a sense of solidarity, from which they can begin to try to educate the 'normals' about their own unique experiences:Whether that be artists, introverts [and see also my piece here], Highly Sensitive People, Mad Pride or autistic people lobbying to be accepted as a neurological minority.
Hi @Altamirula, nice to meet you. Can you expand on this point about cultural differences?  Have you worked in Japan or experiencedvarious situations directly, or is is something you've read about? Interestingly, I wasnt paying too much attention to the question Pauline first addressed in this post, and yet seeing confirmations from such personal points above makes me wonder indeed if there is something more to explore here. If you have ideas on how we can frame this question of different emotional responses even more specific to the art world, we can launch a challenge so that we can bring more domain insights. Let me know, I'd be interested.
@Michel this looks like a very dire situation in Madagascar :-( I'm glad the business ideas list provided some inspiration, but you'll have to see how much impact DIY business ideas can have on poverty at first. I did not go ahead with any of these ideas in Nepal because @Dipti Sherchan advised me that in her country, ideas involving new technology will have a hard time to be accepted in the villages. Something like a DIY backup system with used Li-Ion batteries is just over their heads, for example.Instead, the EDGE Academy ("pocket university") concept that @Alberto mentioned came up (it is here by the way). It's about providing the education that will later enable citizens in Nepal's countryside to solve their other issues by themselves, including with new appropriate technology like the ideas from my list. I still really want to implement the pocket university in a large scale, but have not yet found a funding partner for the project so far. So for the start, there will be just a coffee growing course in combination with a project for international direct sales for Nepali coffee. (Edgeryders LbG provided some seedfunding for that project.)Perhaps you know of agricultural and / or handicrafts products from Madagascar that are interesting for export to Europe (storable, high value per weight)? I can tell you what we have found out about direct sales of food items from Nepal to Europe. Customs etc. is very doable, and revenues for farmers will be about 200% of what they get in the traditional trading system (and even that is very high for coffee because Nepali coffee is traded as a specialty … so it can be a 400-500% improvement for some "more ordinary" coffees from around the world). Let me know if you want any more infos on that.
I saw your post after recent activity on this thread @Alberto... I was wondering if you have read anything about rites of passage in more detail? What is the aspect that creates stronger cohesion? Is it the selection process and 'insider vs outsider' dynamic, is it the sharing of pain and hardship that creates stronger connections between individuals, maybe another reason?I'll recommend this book as well for everyone who is interested in the topic.
My own experience with artistical education and the myth of sensitivity and creativity being linked to madness, depression, angst, is a sad one. I have found some solace and the begging of an understandment of the issue in the cultural differences between Europe, USA and Japan in this respect. The role of the artist and the way art is socialized varies greatly when you compare these traditions and to our shame Europe exhibits a very self-destructive narrative to live by. Maybe that could be a meaningful starting point to unravel the question, I hope it helps.
@Michel do you have friends involved in running their own small shops or local businesses? You might enjoy this inventory if only for being inspired - from dry toilets to recycled plastic materials, to low energetic household items.. great stuff. Also courtesy of @Matthias .

@Matthias and all, the Amish story points rather to the fact that communities do go for prevention, at least in some cases, and in a way that no health system does. @Lakomaa thinks this is because in modern care system, the entity receiving the care and the entity paying for it are always separate: sick person vs. taxpayer for state provision, insured-insurance company for private sector provision. So, it is always privately optimal to dump the cost of healing onto others, rather than assume the cost of prevention oneself. Seen through this lens, community provision is fundamentally different, because the entity receiving the care is not an individual, but the (sub-Dunbar or equivalent) community, and that's the same as the payer. Hence the apparent lack of market failure in care provision among the Amish. So what's going on with prevention of unwanted pregnancies? Public health people I have talked to tend to shrug and say it's endemic. The window of opportunity for stupid and careless behaviour is a little too wide, the drive for instant gratification over prudence is literally a biological imperative, and even the best contraceptives only have a 99.99% effectiveness. If, say, in Italy you have about 20 million couples, if 10% of them are having sex tonight and all of them use contraception, you are going to get 200 unwanted pregnancies tonight, in just one European country. Best you can do is reduce the incidence of such incidents, but no human society ever achieved zero unwanted pregnancies. 
My 1945-1960 "boomer" generation is now heading into retirement, fixed incomes, scant savings and other common attributes.  This has always been the case with elders as a whole, but with my generation and my kids' equally large "millenial" generation, the sheer numbers of people needing care are about to go sharply up and remain there for decades.In the USA, the fabled land of plenty where you are free to succeed and also free to fail, statistics show that the average life savings of my generation are barely enough to sustain them (us) for a year in anything like the standard of living now enjoyed.  And that stadard is lower already than our parents' WWII generation that was both smaller and wealthier, with a vastly larger middle class.  Then what will become of everyone? American Social Security is robust now but without a lot more care and feeding from a unified nation, it won't stay that way.  And the cost of urban living is going up fast all over America.  Sending seniors out to the country where the health care is worse and one has to drive everywhere isn't an answer. At least seniors in the USA have Medicare, but that alone won't cover the total cost of health care.  I think we are going to see a shift towards the generations recombining inoto households and compounds in the coming years.  The "generation gap" that very much existed for my generation and my parents was, and still is in a way, much greater that what we see with my gernation and my kids.  I have four kids, all well into adulthood.  Two of them let me know regularly that they are open to us combining households in later years.  Getting my own mother to agree to such a thing with me or my brothers is like pulling teeth.
While this story documents the power of underground networks to find pragmatic solutions, I am wondering if and why "P2P care" solutions do not equally pop up to create solutions through prevention (that is, preventing the pregnancies in the first place)? It could be that P2P solutions have a problem with collective motivation here, just as governments tend to rather react that act proactively, but more severe since P2P / underground solutions are so resource constrained. If so, that could point to a major issue with all P2P solutions into care (that is, making for a nice research focus).I'm pretty sure there is common ground to say prefentive solutions are preferrable (assuming that women who are undergoing abortion would have preferred not to, that is, not to have become pregnant in the first place). So, no need to refer to laws or morals. Even if the law allows it, there is still reason to prevent pregnancy.So even though contraception is widely available in Europe, on a society scale there are still this many unwanted pregnancies. What I'm wondering here is about the reasons for this, and what P2P initiatives can do and are doing here? Of course this will have to do a lot with slow-changing "fuzzy targets" like culture, taboos, sexual practices and preferences. A crazy story from Nepal about how all this impairs the use of "normal" contraceptives among the young generation is this one (Natalia found it some time last year). But in Europe …? What's going on here?
These stories are quite ghastly. The silver lining is that communities tend to step into giving care, and to do so more when the care problem is "close to home". In the end, reproductive health and control over one's body are an absolute, so prohibitions don't work. People go underground, organize informal networks, and things happen anyway. And this means that, maybe, a good way to do public policy on care is just to let people free to provide for each other, then step in to help with those which are obviously the most pressing concerns, such as this one. Concerns are revealed by the efforts put into addressing them, even when that means breaking laws and running the risks associated with it. Of course, my remarks refer to a theoretical world without politics, where all decision makers are serene, evidence-oriented and well-meaning. :-)
This is a fascinating project.  I have alerted a close friend, an American journalist who has done important radio and print reporting on the refugees in Greece, to come have a look at this topic becfause of this specific project and because of the networking going on in this conversation.One question: by "solidarity" do you mean a formal association or something more loosely arranged through a kind of self-identification?
Interesting to read you John, I know a couple of those who want to stick to their freedom, and that sounds understandable. I guess what matters is self determination and individual health, and if that is found separate from coliving in family that's just how it is. The impossibility seems to be in our inability to provide deeper care when people fall through the cracks - if someone is forced to change their life to adjust to scarcity, whether the ill, old or the caretaker her/himself.  I see people coping at most, because there is no real choice and assessment of the situation outside constraints. 
.. is what @Matthias would probably say. Worrying about those things doesnt seem like the best use of our time, I agree.
In fact, I think that the abortion underground functions so well purely because  and thanks to the hypocrisy of the Polish society. Probably after decades of liberal regulations to some extent women are aware of the fact that abortions are needed, but catholic brainwashing has been so effective, that they're trapped between the moral and the pragmatic views on abortion. Now what seems to prove this is that women are not interested in lobbying for their right to abortion - they somehow agree to comply with the rules by having them underground and accepting the stigma, rather than fighting for their rights. Imagine even if the lowest estimate of 80.000 women having illegal abortions a year is right, and 10 percent of them would be up to fight with the system on that, we'd have a pretty great leverage to change the law by now. But we don't. have that. Well, at least until now - but this remains to be seen because we also have a conservative revival going on and if the church steps in, you never know who'd stay on top of things. I'd rather not expect us going any more liberal than we're at the moment. Another thing is that part of the available options just use the loopholes, they're not illegal. I guess you can't stop a woman from going abroad or having pills. And a lot of turning the blind eye on the doctors who i believe are well known for doing the abortions despite working underground.About the movement now, I think there is a chance for some momentum - but I'm not too optimistic about it. We're observing a bit mobilization of civil society ever since the new government came into power, but that rarely brought any results. At the end, they use their democratic victory to pass any decision they seem fit - and giving up on a project of an outrageous reform just to keep rather shameful status quo is not a huge failure for them I believe. We might be building awareness and capacity for the future right now. Let's see. 
Hi Orange House,I am coming to Greece this winter to offer (free) psychotrauma help in my trauma tour bus. Are you interested in hosting me? I can offer you trauma training, info sessions, trauma best practices and selfhelp, also individual consultations. Please visit my website and contact me if interested. I will be in Athens in january 2017ybe
I didn't know the full extent of the situation when over the past weeks the world was following protests against anti abortion regulations..  I mean, having parents who lived through a communist pro natality decree and anti-abortion strict controls coupled with the shadyness of alternatives (one hears stories..)  does give me an idea.. But present times, whoa.  Thank you Natalia for sharing. How do the informal groups survive in this scene? Is there low enforcement and little policing which allows them to circumvent laws? Also,  are you hopeful after the so called success of the protests? 
Your plans sound great, let's speak again closer to the time that you come and see which groups/places/people you are interested in meeting here related to your project. Your services could be very beneficial to refugees so we can get you in contact with groups working with refugees or the social solidarity clinic of Thessaloniki which is another great initiative working on a community voluntary basis.
for sure, let's keep in touch everyone!
Speaking as an American at the age when living parents are all advanced seniors - and many of those seniors live in homes and facilities, while it can be said without danger of over-generalizing, that to many in my age group, having your late-age senior living with you is seen as an inconvenience.  But I think at least when it comes to that WWII generation in the US, a very large number of them want to keep their independence as long as humanly possible.  They don't want to live with the family and they don't want to cede authority over their "space" to any of their kids.  So, it isn't all neglect and self-interest.  I know a lot of people my age who have parents who don't want to move in, or they do it as a kind of last resort.  The ones who do, and take on a role in the family that I think is more like the model Alkasem describes, seem pretty happy though.  I admire it.  When I was younger living in San Francisco which has a very high Asian population, it seems like all of my asian friends had an elderly relative, usually a grandparent, living in their house.  Every time I went over to this one friend's house in Chinatown, granny was always in the kitchen cutting up vegetables or something.  I would see that and think, "that isn't gonna happen at my house."  Neither generation wanted it.
me I think the issue is more simple , in the middle east we say we live in a big families because it is more warm , inherited consensus make it so easy , trust me , in Syria I never worried about what I,m gonna eat , who,s I,m gonna spend time with ( because of the agenda of duties for people , neighbours , family ) , I started to wonder about that only in europe :)
..I really don,t know I was born and I raised up like this untill we don,t think about it , belive me when I say : I started to wonder about those things here in Europe
:-) I am so looking forward to meeting you all !
Me, @ChristinSa @To_Steki @Positive-Voice and maybe some others, we (or our projects) are in the same neighbourhood. So, when @ybe and @Alex Levene visit Thessaloniki, we can arrange a creative meeting! Thanx to this community!
It's lovely to see you "next door neighbours" connect in the context of a global community! Let's stay in touch, though, there are many people in the Edgeryders community, all over Europe, trying to help out, healing our ailing societies. @Alex Levene is an obvious example, but there are others. The potential for mutual learning is obvious. 
I would like to have some more contacts in Thessaloniki; I still have room in my agenda (december) to help a couple of organisationsf.ex with trauma info sessions for the helpers (basic trauma information, interventions and exercises) or by helping develop on ongoing 'how-to-cope-with-trauma-practice, or...thx, ybe
@ybe thanks for your kind words, i agree with what you are saying about these two factors and this is what i tried to highlight in my article! Your traumatour project also seems super interesting and it is very exciting to see that more people are planning to visit Thessaloniki with their projects in the future! I am in contact with people working in alternative health and spiritual health projects here in Greece so I could put you in contact with them, if you are interested.
See you soon!
@Alex Levene good to learn about the work of HelpRefugees, I have not come across them so far but will look for more information and will try to contact their team in Greece to see what they are doing. I am very much in favour of refugee self-organisation or projects involving the solidarity movement and refugees in horizontal relationships (althoug I am aware that this is not always easy to achieve) but I can see and understand that some of the more formal orgs are also being organised in a way that allows quite a lof of self-organisation or self-management in practice and are doing a lot of great work on the ground. I have seen this already with some organisations working in the camps around Greece.It will be great also to have you here in Greece! Please let me know when this happens and I will arrange to meet you with our group in order to share our experiences and other valuable information.
This is great @Aravella Salonikidou! I have heard about your project and have 'seen' you virtually here and there on facebook, mainly through Room 39 and Steki Metanaston groups/pages, as I can understand that you are also helping the people there. I am also involved with some of the groups at Steki so we could perhaps meet there sometime, or at Micropolis, another social space nearby where this R2R call center project is based. I would love to see how we could possibly collaborate and help each other and I am sure that there is a lot to share/learn from the work that we and other people in our networks, are doing. I will connect with you on facebook to stay in touch! :)
I am glad you find this project interesting @Alberto , I was also very excited to hear about it when I visited this Lesvos camp. Not only because it encourages refugees to learn new skills or use existing ones, but also because of the great idea of reuse of plastic materials and environmental awareness related to the project. I wrote an article about it which was published here, although it is in Greek there is quite a few photos from the camp and the handmade bags, if you wish to have a look. You can also find more info about this self-organised Lesvos camp on the following link, with contact details, in case you would like to contact them about this specific project.
I find this a very hopeful story1) because of the involvement of refugees themselves - it is so empowering to be able to do something to improve your life, to have work, to have a life, an income and to be part of a community2) because of the 'amplification' factor - you put a lot of energy in connecting different initiatives and projects and that is what we need to create general and global changethxybe from traumatour (soon in thessaloniki)  
@Big Bang Schools welcome from me too!I'm a bit late to the party, but I'm curious if you also work with secondary and high schoolers? My mum teaches at a pretty mainstream school in Romania and was just telling me the other day that they would love to partner up with schools abroad for creative exchanges betweel pupils. Is that something you would consider? Also, if you're involved in international educational projects and could use a partner in this area, let me know! 
Nice to meet you @rem_it, I'm guessing you're part of the Milano crowd?What rural areas do you have in mind for deploying this technology?
@aravellasalonikidou Hello Aravella , I am in the middle of organizing and planning my tour to Greece. I would like to fix date(s) with you. What do you need from me? What could I offer? To the Thessaloniki projects you're in i? Maybe have a skype conversation this week? I would like to fix dates for the beginning of december. Would that be allright with you?contact me by mail ybe@traumatour.eu or skype chez_filly19thx - I look forward meeting you!
It's such an important topic in contemporary life which has ties to so many other domains of life, and politics. I find that a reflective conversation with some kind of "distance" such as this one helpful for handling the feelings. And for sensitising others/ building literacy around how to help/support the grieving process. Somehow this is being built around mental health especially depression. Grief? Not yet...
Hi @Patrick AndrewsI echo your sentiments and feel that grieving does not have to be temporal. We tend to associate a negative connotation with grief - that the griever "has not moved on", is "affecting others", is "bothersome" - that moralizes the different beliefs and practices people have about the dead. In some cultures, the dead are permanently embedded into the daily lives of the living, such as when Taoists pray to their ancestors via altars, or when the Japanese pay respects to their dead in mediated ways through digital budisan on apps and websites. For some cultures/some of us, these everyday integrations bring comfort and recovery more than any prescribed grieving period will, and digital media are certainly helping to normalize these options.
Hi @Alberto,I responses to some of these in my reply to Patrick below. I think the key distinction between the infamous Black Mirror episode and other forms of memorialization is the conflation of representation of a person with the actual person. When we mourn through artifacts and practices, we remember selective attributes of the dead and memoralize the things significant to us. But we seek not to replicate, copy, reduplicate these sensations and connections. They are nostalgia rather than replication, which is probably why concept behind the BM episode was so arresting - it sought to replace the dead rather than remember him. 
Hi @Nadia,Thanks for your thoughts. I'm sorry to hear about your cousin and share in your experience that these fleeting witnessing of the social media profiles of the dead are a jarring juxtaposition that solicits the grieving process all over again. Yet, many of the young people I interviewed expressed that this presence brought them comfort and helped in their recovery, because the memory of their loved one is permanently embedded into their social media networks and uses, and the digital footprints they share can be achived and memoralized on the digital platform of social media (they pay less attention to the public nature of some of these platforms).Memorialization of the dead for the dead who can no longer speak for themselves is indeed tricky. I think there is an implicit hierarchy of grief and proximity among the loved ones of the deceased that influencers who gets to have a say. I personally feel a little put-off when folks of super-distant, loosely aggregated, weak social ties excessively express their grief over my sister, especially when some folks start comparing the authenticity and intensity of their grief. But I remind myself that it is not in my place to police how people grief, because we all cope in ways that help us. So I end up putting aside some of these negative feelings, and reach out to those in the 'inner social circle' for mutual aftercare. 
Of course part of why I found it interesting is because it is an unrepresentative outlier. But still, outliers show potential.http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/577/something-only-i-can-see?act=1#playIf you contrast that with the wikipedia entry on self diagnosis, which say things like:"One of the greatest dangers of self diagnosis in psychological syndromes, is that you may miss a medical disease that masquerades as a psychiatric syndrome. Self-diagnosis also undermines the role of the doctor-which is not the best way to start the relationship. Then there is the fact that we can know and see ourselves, but sometimes, we need a mirror to see ourselves more clearly. By self-diagnosing, you may be missing something that you cannot see. Another danger of self diagnosis is that you may think that there is more wrong with you than there actually is. Self-diagnosis is also a problem when you are in a state of denial about your symptoms."I have to say it seems like there is something rotten in the state of Denmark. How much research money gets spent on improving methods of self diagnonsis exactly?Not much it seems:Pubs since 2015 https://scholar.google.no/scholar?as_ylo=2015&q=self+diagnosis+health+care&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5Pubs overall https://scholar.google.no/scholar?q=self+diagnosis+health+care&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5 
I've worked on/brooded over some things that may be helpful in connection to this.1. A minimal self-diagnosis kit, that can be extended by modules. The basic version would be perhaps something like "where there is no doc/dentist" in an adapted audiobook format. This would not require literacy and could be provided via extremely cheap mp3 player (sell for 
I & a friend have put some thought into care & self driving cars here (creative commons): https://cocreate.localmotors.com/RaMansell/healthy-movement/I also have a couple of ideas regarding hygiene (shower mods), and had worked on a prototype of for electrical stimulation of muscle cells grown in a dish.I'd love to discuss those things with someone who has a little more care background than I do (materials science).
@Alberto try these: http://www.enallaktikos.gr/ar22107el-o-afgan http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2016/06/16/koinonia-sosivia-prosfyges-_n_10483414.html
Many thanks for the kind words @ChristinSa, i'm really glad that my words touched you.It's interesting also that it made you think of camps at places like Idomeni. The team who manage the warehouse in Calais and do a lot of the groundwork on the Jungle camp is led by the British charity organisation HelpRefugees. They also did a lot of work in Idomeni during the last year as well. I believe they have now moved their operations in Greece to Thessaloniki, so perhaps you have come across them and their team members? I saw that they recently opened a new distribution warehouse there.I have been talking to their team and i'm trying to find a time in early January when i can come out to Greece and talk to them/see what they are doing there. I hope that during this time i might also be able to meet some of the great people and organisations that have shared their stories on Edgeryders (@To-Steki, @Aravella Salonikidou, @Pavlos)
Thanx for sharing @ChristinSa!  It could be nice to meet you! We run "next door's" project and we don't know each other. Now I think we have this chance. I'd like to know more details and how I can help.
Thank you for the encouragement! I'm working on my article these days, so I'm a little bit (more) buzy! I'm glad to know about R2R. I didn't know about this project. I'll be in touch!
"In the informal PIKPA camp in Lesvos for example, refugees create beautiful, colourful bags from discarded, life-jacket materials and are also planning to distribute them abroad."Do you have more information about this story, @ChristinSa ? It sounds amazing! 
Dear @Noemi thanks for the encouraging words and suggestions! I know about the great work of 'RefugeesWork' initiative as we collaborate with them through FairCoop on a global level. I am not sure they know about our local call center project in Thessaloniki, but I am glad that this article and your comment gave the opportunity for this 'connection'. I hope more people continue to share their inspiring stories in order to keep discovering common paths and shared visions.
@Alberto thank you for your comment and for pointing out these 2 great articles by @Alex Levene! I enjoyed reading them from the first until the last word and felt very touched as they brought up images of informal camps in Greece (e.g. Idomeni in the north borders, the islands and other places) where similar situations and an amazing solidarity movement arose to provide care for the people there.In all these places, it was very encouraging to see what can be achieved when determination of refugees and solidarity from activists/volunteers is combined in a self-organised and impulsive way. In the informal PIKPA camp in Lesvos for example, refugees create beautiful, colourful bags from discarded, life-jacket materials and are also planning to distribute them abroad.There is many hopeful examples of such great initiatives in Greece and other countries and I am sure they will multiply as refugees are settling for a longer-time period in their new living places.What seems to be important right now, in order to make all this effort more meaningful and useful, is to move further from just providing for the basic needs to create structures of solidarity and cooperation that can provide more sustainable solutions and allow people to take care of themselves and feel empowered. This is a big challenge that lies ahead but we should start thinking this way if we want to make a real change to both their lives and ours.
Good words, Alex. Same for me.The trap is what to me is a deadly combination: a lot of flexibility and many roles to choose from, on one hand, and being a generalist .on the other hand. These two can sometimes get you to drift off and not focus on one area at a time -> hence some extra messiness in a flat organisation, as prompted by @Yannick.
Great story, Christine! I find it so useful to see people like you, Alex, @Aravella Salonikidou who are not just contributing on the ground, but also take the time to write the story and build this layer of connectivity that is needed for multiplication as you mention.. or remodeling of cooperation. It seems you're on a promising path. I will try to support this in any way I can. And if you know someone who is interested to set up shop online to work out distribution of eg. handmade objects abroad - this team in Berlin led by @ninabreznik and @serapath are offering free coding courses for refugees.
I'm curious what is an actionable proposal from the group and how it is being received..? Going straight into policy making seems like a titanic work, i'd be interested in how food waste is being approached at the policy level, if at all? This seems like a topic many people care about and which is already seeing promising small scale solutions, particularly in Germany.. with Foodsharing.de, Yunity, community gardens, pop up fridges and many others. 
It's definitely worth reaching out to arts organisations to see how they respond to these types of ideas as well. I don't know about the mainland european models, but with the drastic reduction in state subsidy and the lack of increase in American style donor funding, UK based performing arts organisations have become much more interested in the ways they can repurpose buildings for theatre, creative industries and wider arts based practices.An interesting case study would be Theatre Delicatessen in London:http://theatredelicatessen.co.uk/about/They seem to only ever work in spaces that most others would move out of. Since they started they have had London bases in a disused factory in the West End (now a boutique hotel, i believe) then they moved into the recently abandoned Guardian newspaper head office, now they're moving across the river to an old Victorian library building.They're less interested in what the space was before than what it can be in the future.
At different points in my life i have found myself settling into each strand.I think that i'm lucky that i have a mixture of practical and esoteric skills that allow me to find a happy place doing a variety of tasks. I often find that the more 'mindless' a physical task is the more it opens my mind up to thinking about the bigger picture.That said, i have found that i only really excel when i'm allowed to focus on one area at a time. If i need to be a doer, then i can't also be a prepper. The same with preparing and leading; Leading and thinking.I do also think that 'thinking' and 'leading' are mutually exclusive properties. I believe that leaders emerge naturally from each section or strata. You see this kind of strategic leadership built into highly heirarchical organisations like the armed forces. You have 'doer' leaders and 'prepper' leaders and 'thinker' leaders. 
When you first posted your comment i had a rush to answer it immediately. I had a gut reaction that there is a response to the provocation.But try as i could i couldn't find the correct words to frame it.I'm not sure i've worked it out fully even now but i think that the answer is this."if you build it, someone will come"The most important part is to not be concerned about attracting a predefined set of people to a structure, but to accept that the people who are drawn to your initiative are 'de facto' the right people. Self- selection.I feel that this is similar to the Edgeryders platform itself. Perhaps information around how people chose to engage in a digital landscape can be extrapolated out into the way they engage with physical organisations/structures/bodies in the 'real' world?
I agree with Alberto, epsecially in terms of having low risk starting points.  Because everyone brings to a situation their own place on a kind of continuum between a willingness to risk getting burned by someone in order to increase the possibilites of fruitful new relationships, and being protective of oneself to the point that you only "let someone in" after they have demonstrated in some way their worthiness.
Great stuff, @ChristinSa ! I love the "R2R" concept. With @Alex Levene we had already appreciated the self-organising skillls demonstrated by refugees in the case of The Jungle in Calais (I highly recommend you read his beautiful posts: one and two).The Jungle behaves the way it does because it is not an official camp. It's more like a favela: the first stop in a migrant's social journey, which mostly goes upwards in the social ladder. So, refugees are more free to cooperate, R2R, then they would be in an official camp. Their ingenuity and skills come into play: they make their own lives better, and become empowered at the same time. Your own story, it seems, goes much in the same direction. 
I really enjoyed Loic's presentation. It was very practical: disable lifts so you can use the stairway to have social control while leaving the space open, out services at ground level, reuse office space as highly flexible living quarters...I think this could be a general purpose tool. A sufficiently large, flexible and central building can act like a coral reef from many life forms to use it and transform it. In 123 Rue Royale we see a community kitchen and a library, for example. @Yannick , is there a way that Loic himself could join this discussion? Would he be up for answering our comments? 
My take on this is: you create trust by collaborating, not the other way around. Collaboration comes first.The trick is to create situations where collaboration is cheap, and people can try it at no great risk to themselves. 
@Yannick , you have a point here. I would like to add my own experience. Here it is: there is a positive correlation between being good at different things, like thinking, prepping and executing in your scheme. Smart, hard working people tend to be better on all three (or n-) dimensions with respect to others. So, I very much share @Noemi 's point of view: when we meet an interesting person, we try to imagine a role for her, then try to create the conditions for us to be able to offer her that role. But, at the same time, the role is embedded in the project, not in the organisation. People can try their hand at roles, then maybe move on to different ones in the next project. This allows for some limited pairwise adjusting, too. I prefer pure research to middle management roles, and I prefer middlie management to leadership. Still, in many of my former projects I had to lead, because no one else would do it (or could do it). I led reasonably well, with some mistakes, and I would do it again if I cared enought about the project. But when I find a better leader, I gladly step down to become, I guess you would say, a doer. 
I found the part about living in diversity most interesting - and I imagine some of the founders in 123 are real community governance experts having made it possible for people to pay differentially according to their financial status. I don't understand how this case is not more referenced or visible online.. I only found a couple of youtube TV coverage videos. 
Having met you in Brussels made me really grateful, @AlkasemI wanted to say that the intergenerational support has a strong tradition in some places in Europe, and some practices are ongoing - I even wrote about how my grandma and grandgrandma before her come to live with her children at old age. What has changed I feel is that we perceive this to be a burden to some extent - and tend to see less the great potential for mutual support. The response to your question about children moving away to become independent is true, and so living with parents after a while can feel like taking a step back. Especially in cities and urban areas, we seem to have no time to engage in real conversations and see what new things we each have to say to each other or needs we have, even in a family.. 
@wishcrys Thanks for this. I suffered a loss many years ago and couldn't understand the reaction of the people around me. It was if they allowed me a month or two to "get over it" and then I was expected to move on. Some good friends couldn't bring themselves to mention the dead person's name or admit she ever existed - as if it would be too painful. Yet I wanted to talk, and talk about her. But I got the message and shut up too, to everyone's relief it seemed. I remember crying in front of my brother a few months later and he didn't know how to cope. But he hadn't been taught that expressing emotions is normal and human. I would be delighted if the coming of the digital age can have a positive impact in tis respect, enabling people to express their grief, and their concern for the grieving, more boldly and freely. 
Wow, @wishcrys . This is a beautiful, well researched post. I am definitely not young anymore, and I guess I am still moving within the paradigm of "mourn, then move on". Actually, my understanding is that you mourn exactly to make peace with your loss, so that everybody can move on. People in my circles keep memories and memento of those who passed away, but they do not want them to be too interactive.This is why the famous Black Mirror episode about digital afterlife was so disturbing. The protagonist was flailing about, unable to move on, as the AI occasionally manages to make a convincing simulation of her dead husband. Convincing, that is, to her: we, the spectators, are not fooled. We shake our heads as she holds on to the simulacrum. We see her doing almost all the cognitive work to build the illusion of an ongoing relationship. This is a well known bug in our cognition: we antropomorphize. In computer science, this was first exploited by the famous ELIZA program in 1966. psychological research around it established that "[...] even if fully aware that they are talking to a simple computer program, people will nonetheless treat it as if it were a real, thinking being that cared about their problems." – sourceI had a friend who was very active on social media – in fact one of its early users, and author of a 2003 book thereabout. When he passed, I unfollowed his accounts. The last thing I want is a digital ghost haunting my feeds.

Despite a cold and rainy evening the FES cycling event was successful.  The test riders got carried away pedalling with FES activated legs. This was an open air event showing functional and fun use of scientific results. The imperession was that the BerkelBike was useful and we should work on making more readily available.More information here:http://wehandu.it/it/eventi/  
Hi Crystal.I am sorry for your loss. This is a difficult topic to write about and not sure how to go about it. But I'll just go ahead and try. Reposting your questions here with an attempt at answering them below:Have you ever commemorated the death of a loved one in digital spaces? What did you do? How did others respond to you?Whenever you witness someone sharing their grief on social media, how do you feel? Does it motivate you to respond to the person in particular ways?How can we use social media more conscientiously so as to create spaces for mutual aftercare? What can we do for each other in digital spaces whenever a global grieving event occurs?Four years ago a favourite cousin died in a car accident. Her facebook page is still up and people use it as a memorial site. Sometimes her icon pops up unexpectedly in my feeds and it floors me everytime. I couldn't go to the funeral: it still feels surreal, like she might show up at any time, and the "active" facebook account isn't helping.I am a private person- If and when I do post about anything it is with a lot of consideration. I rarely post about someone while they are alive if it is not to share something they themselves intended for public consumption. Posting about someone else's death feels like a violation of their agency and privacy. They can no longer have agency over the narrative spun about them and it somehow adds insult to the injury for me.When I witness others sharing their grief I usually get in touch via a PM. Asking how they are and offering a shoulder to cry on if they need it. Commenting feels to exposed, like participating in a spectacle orchestrated by FB. Did you ever watch "We Live in Public"? I did many years ago and it has definitely shaped how I feel about social media.Using Social Media more conscienscously....mmm I don't know. What immediately comes to mind is that the business models of commercial social media platforms is advertising based "fast" media. I ask myself what effect this has on the dynamics of grief, which are slow and somehow not very condusive to selling anything - except for membership in cults or possibly self-help literature.In my parents cultures grief is a shared experience, there are a lot of social rituals for processing it have written about it in Life and Death at the UnMonastery. I recently came across something called Sunday Assembly. They have set up a secular equivalent to the sunday sermons at church to address the lack of spaces for social communion and other rituals which are key to cementing strong communities. Somehow I feel social media can be used to grow these kinds of movements and to connect a critical mass of people to them. So that when grief strikes, the individual is embedded in a nurturing local community that can help them heal.My two cents..I don't know if it relevant to your work
Hey @LotfiAndSelvi, this reminds me of another Belgian project called DUO for a JOB. Their tagline 'integenerational coaching' sums it up well: older people passing on their skills to young people with a migrant background. Is that something you envision as well? It might be insightful to talk to them as well.In my home town we have a related story going on. The old movie theater  in the city centre, a beautiful building with a rich history and emotional meaning for a lot of people, was bought by project developers after bankruptcy. They plan to install service flats where elderly that are still okay can live in co-housing with people who need care, like other elderly or young people with a disability. Yet the whole project has a very commercial smell hanging around it. Do you meet similar stories, is there an impact on the sector?
There are a number of interesting intergenerational care projects internationally - including: Present Perfect - USA & Fureai Kippu - Japan.The Deventer initiative is terrific. So, too, is the Hogeweyk community which involves young people living alongside people with dementia. I understand there's an initiative in the US where older people are running their own care homes - if anyone comes across a URL leading to further information, please do share it. 
So the lovely @CommonFutures has just shared this in response to my tweet asking for help: Intergenerational Housing in Deventer.It's really something: a project started in 2013 for a new elderly retirement home where students pushed back by unaffordable student housing can also live without paying rent, and in exchange volunteering 30 hrs of social activities per month.
I remember talking with Celine in Bxl about the perks and not of a flat group organising. The hardest part I'm experiencing is with growing - if you have a small team starting up people are more than willing to do everything and teach themselves what they don't usually do in order to make it work. When numbers are in, it takes a conscious effort just to establish processes, or make norms more explicit i.e. double check understanding of the task at hand; make sure there is at least someone committed to the task; reinforcing that it's OK to ask for help; to fail etc.What I found that works is treating everything as a project in and of itself and assigning roles within the project. A making of sales, an event, a funded project, anything. In another one, roles can change, but as long as you have someone acting as a PM with that skillset (probably a prepper?) that takes on the responsibility to think about roles and enable them in the project team.A final point: a flat organisation has leaders of its own, even informal - I can't imagine not having leaders, even multiple ones, giving direction to the org. Don't you have them in your large group Yannick? Falkwinge, who wrote about making great ideas happen with many people contributing, was saying that managing day to day operations require "one portion classic project management, one large portion of wisdom about conflict resolution, and one portion of methods on preserving the swarm’s goals, culture, and values as it grows." OK, his Pirate Party was a swarm-like organisation which is not the same as flat but still pretty free, but also especially at risk of becoming chaotic. So having these hard+soft skills distrbuted within the leadership may help the general organisation and support others to fall into specific roles..
Hi @LotfiAndSelvi, you say the elderly "are viable resources for the development of our society" - what do you have in mind? Twenty years of working for them must be pretty righ in insights.I only know of very sporadic activities that are intergenerational - and most happen around holidays: for example youth taking presents to care homes and spending time with their new grannies for a day or so. It seems to put a smile on people's faces, but of course its not substantial, as what you are talking about. Curious if new (co)living models such as @Simonedb's has good news about what can be achieved if generations help each other remain active under the same roof. Are you seeing that Simone or is everyone in your houses still fairly young?
Hello @Positive-Voice, and welcome! I somehow managed to miss this post. You seem quite mature for a non profit and mobilizing volunteers consistently. I was always curious, is there a way to see if you're effective in prevention and raising awareness outside the campaign outputs - for example how many people you've talked to, how many flyers were spread etc? Are you seeing your most vulnerable populations in Thessaloniki more empowered over the years or is your job getting more and more difficult (for reasons that maybe don't have anything to do with your organisation's work)?  
What a great bunch of people! One of the perks of working with Edgeryders is that we come within line of sight of all these super-interesting individuals. I have already interacted with most of them, and cannot wait to read more from all. Ad maiora. 
What you write makes sense. People already think in this way to some extent, there are some good examples in our team of 'doers' that are very aware that they don't like to do the 'thinking' etc. I often hear people talk about themselves in these (general) categories and assume this awareness is already more widespread.Yet teams often still fail. Where lies the problem? Are we not taking the insight far enough?
Yes we are thinking about that 'piste', trying to bring together existing organizations!
I thought about you because of the recent protests in Poland. The idea I'm getting is this: tracking "shadow", informal, semi-legal initiatives on care means mapping both need and capacity. It carries information on what people think is important, and on the amazing self-organising ability of communities. What we need is a true voice. I got the info from an article. It is a good article, there's a good story but no one behind it we can go back to for more. I was hoping you'd be able to track someone who is personally involved in this service (or others, connected to reproductive health and well-being) who would jump in and comment, or share some more experience. Poland, I would say, is a good place to start. 
@Alberto, with pleasure - do you want me to look specifically at the abortion by-paths? 
I am no cyclist, and have left the country five years ago.  So no, I guess I am not the right person. ☺
Yes @Alberto that's the key and why we do a FES cycling event. We also need marketing guys to promote and recruit (we have not been effective at that). Can you or others help out? 
Hi @Alberto, you are very right.. However I have been cycling around milano on tandem with a trailer (thats a long veicule) and two kids. I've learned that the trick is to know where to go and its a challenge (https://edgeryders.eu/en/can-we-hack-or-tweak-maps-to-help-where-infrastructure-fails-for-soft) we have to work on after our kick off event :http://wehandu.it/it/fesbici/  
Kickoff eventhttp://wehandu.it/it/fesbici/;-)
How can we create a better health system if we need all kind of difficult systems to create the trust that isn’t there really?Wow, @Alkasem , this is a really interesting take on things. I agree 100% with you on this. I never lived in the Middle East, so I do not have your experience. But it doesn't look like the West lacks trust. All our societies run on trust; and normally such trust is rewarded, because we are rule-abiders: we stand in queues, show up for work and at school (resaonably) on time, and do not really cheat. Cheating is quite rare.So: can you say more about the lack of trust you see? What is it that is done differently in Syria? 
... mais est-ce que avez pensé comment elle se peut réaliser? Est-ce que il y a quelque chose que nous pourrions faire pour la rendre en peu plus proche? 
the reaction give me the idea to share it with some people that i know organize game jams. It could be an interesting theme for them. Will see what comes out. It was after the discussion with Lotfi and Alkasem about the elderly that this project popped back in my mind. Not everything can be a success story, but at least can be shared to become a learning moment :)
Hi @RéseauxSolidaires, it was great to meet both of you in Brussels. Sorry for writing in English, it comes easier to me..  I am wondering whether it isn't easier to join forces with another group in town working already on this? If it doesn't do the very human approach you are arguing for, perhaps making a project with them is a first step. Remember our last session at HUIS VDH where this was an advice we shared with each other?Bonne chance!
..what else have you been involved in over the years Yannick? :-) You're carrying quite a toolbox of projects.I see cowork spaces and hubs going for gaming nights targeted at youth, but it would look even better if they opened up the participants' age to include older people - maybe less pc and console games and more board games? The latter tend to be more social quicklier. Will keep your thoughts in mind.
Hi @ParamountCaliforniaUniversity how come you joined Edgeryders? Ours is more a community of people, so if you would consider changing your username into a more personal one that would be super, it helps people connect to you/ 
Will be published today or tomorrow
This is really nice to hear. Was just talking with 2 of my Syrian friends and they said it's very important to give some self inniciative push to the newcomers, because they are just being sent from a place to a place to fill this or that form and they become somehow passive, so helping them stay active and creative is super important. Like your approach a lot.I am working on this project  and would like to see how we could collaborate. Maybe you could introduce them to online platfrom for connecting to other newcomers that are here a bit longer and are starting with their self employment or small business and need volunteers or potencial partners... or they can maybe see what are local businesses searching here, to get a better feeling of what is smart to focus on for the future and what skills will they need to learn in order to build a nice future for themselves.Please, if you have time, check a bit what we do and I would be happy if we find some common points for collaboration :)
Alex, this is so nice to hear, please stay in touch and let's push things forward... Thanks also for the link, will check them out and see how we could connect :DNoemi, cool, thanks. Sounds very interesting. Reading... 
Great work.  I salute you.
Keep up the great work! My advice is that for each post you include a call to action to the broader community where you ask for help. That also makes it easier to reach to the specialists in here, which  we do manually, sort of.
Hi Frank, thanks for introducing yourself and for joining OpenandChange project of projects so to speak, in such great capacity. Woodbine rocks :)
I have to fly back to Bxl in a month time and so would be great to reconnect! If anyone is following up with participants, do include me please :-)
"First you squad, then you talk"  - Loic's presentation was great, too bad we don't have the full story here to be able to connect more people to it.@Yannick is the story by any chance in the making?  
Working in the area of homelessness I'm only aware of DOUCHEFlux as a partner in the proposal.. but I may be wrong.Maybe @Yannick can clarify?
Ok, Alberto, probabilmente il "meccanismo" è un poco inusuale per dare mobilità alle persone, ma potrebbe essere comunque interessante partire da ciò che abbiamo a disposizione ...magari chiedendo ai ragazzi dell'ETH di Zurigo un aiutino!Per il collegamento, prova partire da http://www.gennymobility.com/it.
In fact you were involved in that conversation... see the comments, too:https://edgeryders.eu/en/step-up
Grazie, @Francesco_Maria_ZAVA . La sedia a rotelle con i cingoli che si vede nel secondo link mi ricorda certi strumenti che si usano nel trasloco dei pianoforti, e che possono trasportare carichi pesanti (e con il baricentro alto, perché i pianoforti vengono messi in verticale per risparmiare ingombro) su per le scale. Fanno perfino gli angoli sui pianerottoli! Il link a gennymobility risulta rotto.  
Hello @wave , I also was intrigued by this idea, but I don't get it. As far as I know, noise cancellation is predicated each one of us having a "personal" source of reverse-phase sound waves: my headphones, for example. They sample ambient noise (the hum of an aircraft's or train's engine), reverse the sample's phase and emit it in my ears. Your idea of emitting at the source is quite novel, at least I have never heard of it. Would love to know more! Also, as Noemi says, existing noise canc technology works best at cancelling steady white noise-type sound emissions. 
Traffic is scary, for everyone. In my home region, Emilia-Romagna, we have a strong cycling tradition – it is unusually flat for Italy, and that helps. When I moved to Milano in 2001, I found cycling much more difficult because of a deadly combination of cobblestones, tram tracks and just sheer traffic nastyness. Bicycle lanes where almost absent. As a consequence, only "extreme cycling" happened: young, fit men who wore tactical backpacks, army boots and yelled at drivers, and even kicked at their cars. I could just about cope: my (Swedish) wife refused to cycle, saying it was too dangerous. Extreme bikers did things like this:But over the years those extreme people have become sort of cool. A company called Urban Bike Messengers established a bicycle-based delivery service. They cultivated an image of green, cool and a bit scary. Rumour was that, to become a messenger, you had to pass a near-impossible test of crossing the city only in minutes. This encouraged more people to go out and bike. This, in turn, made biking a little safer for everyone, because drivers learned to be a little more attentive. So even more people got out. By the time I left the city, the Decathlon shop in Cairoli was selling 50 to 100 bicycles a day. Eventually, the city council started to take cyclists a bit more seriously; traffic was restricted in the center, some slightly better bike lanes appeared. What this story has to teach is that, perhaps, if you want to make life better for paraplegics you have to start from the urban sport enthusiasts. Which is, after all, the same old story of finding a group of early adopters that pave the way (literally, in this case) for everyone else.
Hello Naomi, I don't understand. We have worked with Yannick for the OpenandChange. Have you not seen our applicant ? 
Dear @Noemi. We are working hard on testing the Hybrid bike as a kickoff party together with WeMake (@Costantino, @Moushira) sharing with OpenCare, demonstrating feasibility of the WeHandU approach. As @Michel says, infrastructure is an issue especially in Italy. (what country are you in?). I know Belgiun like Holland is organized for soft mobility. You just have to fix some weather issues, where Milano has sun all in the plain but no consideration of planning safe infrastructure for cyclists, pedestrians etc.@WinniePoncelet, it could be very good if you could elaborate on why you don’t have handbikers around because the berkelbike is dutch so It would be easy for people around you to get?You have a good point,@WinniePoncelet,  we could imagine raising funds to have a FES bike that people could try locally.I’ve learned two things recruiting wheelchair users as testdrivers1. There is a perception that it may be physically harmful2. People are afraid of traffic. There is a perception that there are nowhere to use the a HandbikeAs for 1. it shows the importance of having clinicians who can evaluate physical aptness for this exercise weighted against the alternative (cardiovascular diseases, pressure sores etc.)As for 2. We need a method of showing where it's possible to go safely, (Google maps in italy does not support cycling).  @Francesco Maria ZAVA and others we could work on this
Hi Noemi,We are a group of students from Master of Interaction Design at Domus Academy. We are now working on Opencare project in colabration with WeMake FABLab in Milano. We have a lot of ideas we know :) This idea has some difficulties about reversing technology which is already there (sound cancellatıon). The way we wanted the prototype to work is that if we can use the existing technology of noise cancellation to design something that can be put on the baby in order to reduce their noise. We can further dıscuss how we were proposing to use the noise cancellation technology here, but for now we have kept this project on hold. Actually we kept every project on hold and we are currently working on the Alzheirmer's Wristband. It is in process now :)
Thanks for sharing this @Rune. I cannot begin to imagine how good it must feel for someone with paralyzed legs to bike independently again. We have good biking infrastructure in my city/Belgium in general, but I rarely see handbikes actually. About where to try the FES bikes: are the bikes customized to the user? Or could you imagine a network of users who are up for letting others test their bike from time to time. On top of that people meet and connect, they are more involved and it's not a huge cost for anyone.
it's really amazing, nice job @Rune, in my country there is a lot of people who suffer from weakening leg muscle and poliomelite.  Those people are usually left aside and need someone's hand to move. On the other side, infrastructure and access to office, public area are not yet developed.
 Very interesting, perhaps you can qualify that in terms of how it helps or not those experiencing it? And can it be a collective process? With OpenCare at large, and Open&Change more specifically- it would be most remarkable to understand what task is there for communities to relief some of this experiences.. Have a look at Cosain - an initiative just starting in Ireland which is based on peer to peer support for mental health recovery, in very collective ways. Highly recommended partners for some of your activites I think.. 
@MAZI I figured you might want to read this. Thom, @Bernard @Teresa_Nilan and their team are incredibly committed to this project and I see you guys comparing notes.For reference, MAZI's story also makes a compelling case for peer support groups and they run these gatherings in both Athens and Thessaloniki. It seems to me they also have had some successes with funding coming in.
Thanks @Rune, impressive how people find their way and maybe mobility doesn't have to be such an exclusionary issue after all.  I'd appreciate if you, your team and the WeMake team also share this with some of the people engaged so far in OpenCare, more minds put together will come up with super insights and helpful advice.. Let's do this.Ping @Rossana Torri to help us reach to some key networks in the city. Thanks!
Thanks @ninabreznik and co.!  I'm just back online after a few days off the platform, and say we take these days to share your post.Also ping @Tomma who is close to some people in the ICC camps and has done great work herself - right up your street dear?  Help us share this?
In fact it is an "international Idea" of various people living around the globe but are somehow connected to developemental issues, many of them  who are in contact with "Integral Theory" and "System Sciences"...There are Nuklei in formation in Germany, Spain and one possibility in Greece. This Nuklei schare common iseas about kooperative, solidary ideas about the next level of human development and are willing to act as facilitators and "pioneering projects" regarding new social and care models. So in it#s very own way CAPE is as well a synergy hub - which of course can be connected to others. Hope this will answer your question.I will check your recommendation as well.Other than the project you mentioned we are building a fuctional model with real people (CAPE) and make different kinds of "open" knowlege availabel for a broader group as well as developing alternative strategies... (humaniversity project within CAPE).
@Imagine the City hi. Thanks for being so generous with your thoughts, especially as a newcomer to this platform. If you are based in Thessaloniki (or are you in Chalkis?), you probably know the ladies at @Tópio who are working with schools on creative redos of public spaces?How do you manage to stay independent if you’re involving such different groups and people? After a while if your “recipe” for events is compelling and people self-organise to follow it, your events will have a life of their own and may be able to move off the grid. Do you coordinate in any way?
Hello @Streetnurses, welcome to Edgeryders and OpenandChange, we have already submitted the application (unless you joined with a different project and I am not recognising you), but if things go well in this first phase and we get to be semi-finalists we will of course get in touch. In it we are saying that over the next two years 150 projects will be running activities to become more solid, sustainable and even generate some source of income. “..because of our high costs of wages it is difficult to fund foundations that are willing to support us” What do you mean by that? For example the MacArthur funding would allow personnel costs, and most large grants that I know of.Oh, I almost forgot. My name is Noemi, community manager, and my own answer to the challenge “How do you give and receive care?” is here, I wrote it a few months ago should you be interested to exchange notes. Let’s stay in touch.
Hello @samadhi.0110 and welcome to Edgeryders. How did you learn about us?Are you based in Greece? I’m not sure how I can help because I don’t understand the context, the problem which the CAPE project is trying to solve: “People feel lost in the cacophony of indusrial, per profit and political chatter” – this looks broad! I would recommend you check out someone @rainbowheart and his piece about his community/ synergy hub in Mont Soleil. Where would your living space be? Or is that already ongoing?
Hey @wave, fun fact: I was reading about your idea as I was flying and thinking how my next big purchase should be a set of noise cancelling headphones.To be clear: not necessarily because of crying babies :-) Yet I don’t understand how it would work because of the very uneven cries and peak sounds which are hard to counteract. Tell us more.
Hi @wave how’s it going? I don’t think we’ve met yet, I’m Noemi one of the Edgeryders community managers. Thanks for taking so much time to read and post here on the platform, even though I’ve been traveling and couldn’t react, definitely catching interest.So what’s your story, how did you become interested in pretty cool ideas like the T shirts?
Indubbiamente, costruire basi di dati ed applicazioni mobili finalizzate alla mappatura del territorio "accessibile" e "non accessibile" pe quanti si avventurano nelle nostre città ed intendano usufruire dei loro molteplici servizi (vedi http://portale.siva.it/it-IT/databases/libraries/detail/id-455), incontra la mia più totale ammirazione e gratitudine.Tuttavia, sicuramente anche per un moto di orgoglio e per un inalienabile desiderio di libertà e di riconoscimento del mio essere cittadino, ritengo occorra adottare un approccio complementare che cerchi di risolvere le specifiche esigenze di ciascun individuo, laddove le barriere materiali sussistono e rinforzino quelle culturali, realizzando soluzioni che consentano al nostro ausilio di disimpegnarsi in sicurezza oltre che con efficienza.A questo scopo, nonostante non abbia competenze tecniche in materia, sto provando a realizzare un concetto partendo da questi esempi:1. http://www.gennymobility.com/uk/genny/design;2. http://www.newmobility.com/2015/06/stairclimbing-wheelchairs-fact-and-fiction/.L'idea di base è quella di realizzare un sistema di mobilità modulare, parzialmente cucito su misura per alcune tipologie di utenza, che possa superare le "difficoltà" del terreno e nel contempo costituire un concentratore di servizi e funzioni avanzate (comunicazione, monitorizzazione parametri, controllo ambientale di casa e postazione lavorativa, ecc.).Certo, questo è chiedere le stelle... ma potrebbe essere l'inizio costruendo quanto meno la rampa di lancio!---------------------------------------------------Undoubtedly, build databases and mobile applications aimed at mapping the territory "accessible" and "inaccessible" eg those venturing into our city and intend to take advantage of their multiple services (see http://portale.siva.it/it- He / databases / libraries / detail / id-455), meets my utter admiration and gratitude.However, certainly for a surge of pride and an inalienable desire for freedom and recognition of my being a citizen, I believe we must adopt a complementary approach that seeks to address the specific needs of each individual, where the material barriers exist and reinforce cultural ones , creating solutions that allow to our aid to disengage safely than with efficiency.To do so, despite not having technical expertise in the field, I'm trying to create a concept starting from these examples:1. http://www.gennymobility.com/uk/genny/design;2. http://www.newmobility.com/2015/06/stairclimbing-wheelchairs-fact-and-fiction/.The basic idea is to realize a modular mobility system, partially sewn tailored to some categories of users, which can overcome the "difficulty" of the soil and in the same time constitute a concentrator of services and advanced features (communication, monitoring parameters , environmental control of the home and work place, etc.).Of course, this is to ask the stars ... but it could be the start of building at least the launching pad!
Nice to meet you @Henrike, and welcome online, I'm Noemi, a colleague of Caroline's, Jahn's and the crew, and have participated in the same format event in Brussels. Thanks to the group for organising and facilitating this workshop, and for tweeting during the day! Our workshop in brussels was happening at the same time and it was lovely to join forces, albeit virtually! Speaking of, I would be curious to learn about the initiatives of those who participated, any one that you liked in particular and feel you will be able to collaborate with in the near future? Hopefully some of these days we get to learn more about Flipped job market, I read you referencing elsewhere here on Edgeryders and from the site looks very interesting, except unfortunately I don;t understand German. Let me know if I can help in any way.
Thank you for your comments.Our garden is theoretically for children, then for their families. Which means that...The outstanding feature of our experience is the fact that we are not an intellectual or "political" movement, but the ordinary people of this district: a cross-section of families of both traditional and immigrant background, who take their children to the garden (basically a playground with trees). Everybody except the very, very rich.However, we opened this garden in a situation of conflict, an object lesson for everybody on gentrification and the ruthlessness of real estate speculation: we did not put the politics into it, they did, and everybody has learned the lesson.Communities can be built on imagining the past, children help us to imagine the future together and learn to build solidarity - we love our place and its history, but anybody from Senegal or from Germany who also loves them is welcome; In this context, we do small things with major implications, for example:- markets where parents give and take children's clothes for free, which teaches one enormously important things about the wastefulness of our society;- violin lessons, chess and opera singing because we believe that "beautiful","elegant" and "difficult" things should not be the monopoly of a financial elite;- the only free football school in Florence, thanks to the unique Lebowski football team;- attempting to revive the dying crafts of Florence and discover the history of our district, with all its tremendous historical implications;- we are trying to find a way to set up a cooperative to give work to the many families who have skills, but are being driven off the job market;- we are beginning to develop more sustainable ways of consumption, in a gradual way that everybody can understand, also thanks to the fact that we have a child's birthday party nearly every day in our garden! And a child's birthday party is a much better place to deal with these issues, than a smoke-filled meeting hall...Whatever we do, we try to move together with as many other organisations as possible in our district - ranging from the parish church to the young people occupying an abandoned house, to small shopkeepers, to the very, very special Florentine institution of "Calcio Storico".We also want to provide the lowest level of basic services, which the "state" is dropping out of, and this is where the issue of health and other care interests us.The institutions first saw us as a harmless group of parents who wanted a place for their children to play,then more or less as enemies,then as a large group of voters who need to be humoured, as well as people who do for free what the state usually has to pay for.Which is alright, we neither hate nor love the dying institutions of our times.We love our people, our monuments, our trees, our bats and cats that come at night, and anybody else in the world who feels like us and realizes that this world should not belong to speculating private monsters or to cold public machines. 
Ciao @Amici del Nidiaci! An Italian myself, I know Florence a bit and understand how it must feel to you. Great that you are taking action! So, from what I understand, your action revolves around coming together to maintain a community garden.  Can you tell us more about that? Is it mostly gardening, or do you do other activities too?Here in Edgeryders, we have a few experiences which are somewhat similar. One is Prinzesinnengarten in Berlin. They sell food, run a small café and give courses in gardening. Real estate speculation is a problem for them, too. Here is the full story: @marcoclausen is one of its protagonists and could tell you more. The other one is Vake Park in Tbilisi, Georgia. In this case, a community formed specifically to protect the park from speculation. Among its leaders were @Nick Davitashvili and others: here is Nick's beautiful TEDx talk.Looking forward to hear from you! 
What if working together for the good of all was the most common business model? Discover A new Economy, starring seven initiatives including Sensorica and ours.Thanks @Positive-Voice for your comment. :)
@Noemi, the first interview was released yesterday on our channel and we will release one per week! :)@Michel we started with CF and asthma but the idea is that projects emerge in different places. As a patient said, its a doctor's thing to separate diseases... but usually, asthma, allergies, etc are mixed. And yes it will include also games about good breathing and hopefully, people not affected with diseases can also become more aware about their health and invest in prevention. ^^We are working on the outcomes to be shown, for example visualizing the evolution of lung capacity, effects of doing therapy or not, etc.
Preventive mourning was used as a concept,  and was the theme of one of the experiental workshops during our psychotherapeutic encounters at village psy. During these workshops which took place in nature,up in the mountain of the Centaurs -where Centaur Chiron the wounded therapist is said to have llived -we were exploring various aspects of trauma.Preventive mourning is the  symbolic or realistic expectaction of loss which  awakens practices of mourning which are in many ways different than mourning after the loss . There are various questions one can ask around this topic,  which essentially  focuses on what it means for an individual to envisage and feel  the losses that are about to come in ones life .The notion was thoroughly explored and many questions were asked:  how do we as individuals react to this notion on a sentimental, cognitive, behavioural, relational level?which is the most difficult part of this experience for us?what experience can we draw from our own lives or our work? how does this impacts ones relationship with ones self and self awareness? how does is impact various aspect of our lives and on who we are?The discussion concentrated around coping mechanisms that we   have drawn from our own experiences of trauma and loss.  We talked about what    helped us and  our clients  deal with what was happening at the time, and how we/they changed after the experience. Concepts such as life appreciation, meaninginfulness etc were also part   of the discussion. 
@BLOODe we would like to help you to create synergies and collaborations, so as to maximize the impact of your project. As for the costs of the logistics, for which, @Noemi did ask for, we would like to present you the volunteers' working team of several EVS groups in Europe who would lovely offer their services for good. Keep walking. 
@Frodizo Really brilliant and moving what you do in Patra. Hope as for the elder people to be reliefing and refilling for their lifes too. Continue the good work. We do support. 
@breathinggame, your story and goal really moving. Hope the expected prototype testing goes. Impressive the amount of people and partners you brought on board. 
@Matthias, I just came across this article about Washington's rivers... yet the situation not so much different from those we discuss here, and some tips how to engage in different ways with the area. 
Hi, @Federico Monaco  seems supercool.  How could you see a collaboration with thE WeHandU initiative?
During the workshop, there were interesting ideas around the topic of "preventive mourning". Maybe @Village-Psy would like to share some more aspects on this topic?
My observation is that many actors in Thessaloniki are active in more than one initiative, so there is this type of "fluid" flowing from one project to the other. Most of these people are characterising themselves as people "that care", and there is a strong sentiment of solidarity. Different groups have different approached on running their projects. For example, there are a few of them that mistrust any type of institutional suppport. This makes some people also get engaged in another project. The result is a very diverse set of attitudes towards volunteer action and the wider frame of care, something that is making it difficult to map, engage and scale. This is probably the case also in Athens, however communities in the capital have more opportunities in terms of funding, interaction spaces and publicity.
Hi Pavlos,'More power to your arm!'I found your point about the disconnect between wealthier Northern European countries and the reality of Greece particularly interesting and enlightening. What we consider to be 'alternative' approaches to the future should be our only way forward.i am reminded of the saying "when things seem to be falling apart, perhaps they are falling into place."It seems that the Greek community could benefit from something like the Scottish Community Right to Buy scheme (http://www.gov.scot/Topics/farmingrural/Rural/rural-land/right-to-buy/Community) Which would allow communities to invest money, tiem and energy into innovative community practices safe in the knowledge that the land they do this upon will not be taken from under them in the event of a systemic failure.I do not know how easy it is to create law in Greece (i imagine it's as difciult as anywhere else!) but is this something that could be advanced at a high level? Just a thoughtAlex
This sounds like a brilliant project.I really like how you saw that there was a matched experience between what you experience as young entrepreneurs and what the refugees experience arriving into the job market.More power to you. I will certainly follow your project very carefully. I wonder also if you know about Empower Hack. I think it is a UK based organisation, but it is doing similar work with women and girls (http://empowerhack.io/)
Its great to see the developement of your project... spreading out the idea and establishing it.Passioned and caring about the women: The ones you work with and the women in general for getting access to a new kind of preventive breast cancer examination that is gentle and pleasent.Thank you for your commitment :)
It was a great workshop with new and old friends. I loved the atmosphere there filled with passion and commitment. And also to see different perspectives and approaches of the other projects aiming for the same impact: to promote health. thank you for caring and sharing!
I wrote my master thesis about the paradigm shift in the working environment triggered by the transformation into complexity (VUCA-World). In my journey to find answers for leadership I´ve learned about Otto Scharmer and Theory U. I love to find a project on that plattform which is connecting to that kind of thinking and using that approach.In our project flipped job market we also take on the challenge for a new mindset in order to live the full potential with lies in every one of us.
as I read about your project I startet to think about the way children see the world and take on challenges... when we grow older, we often loose the curiosity and enthusiasm we had as we were younger. Also the way we learn in school (at least as I remember it from my own schooldays) is based on facts and memorizing them. Getting to discover the miricales of life without judgement while seeking for ways to get further and learn to cope with difficulties is one of the most important thinks we got to teach each other... to challenge children to keep on thinking free and adults to get in that mood again.I love to see how your project is developing :)
Hi @Jenny Gkiougki, you might find interesting this list of links collected by @elf Pavlik and others: https://github.com/ouisharelabs/food-dashboard.
Sorry to hear about the park. Perhaps there is inspiration to be drawn from members of the community who are facing the  same struggles. So some people who immediatey come to mind are:@jordan : https://edgeryders.eu/en/the-urban-shepherd-of-stockholm@Nick Davitashvili: https://edgeryders.eu/en/better-and-bigger-collective-actionThis work of building and caring for communities is challenging. As @marcoclausen points out @marcoclausen, @ecl and @Caroline have alot of experiences in Berlin: See their stories here. But this kind 
Not sure what the data is on what percentage of fathers take parental leave and how long. I'll as around if you want?
Hey @WinniePoncelet was really nice meetin you, makes me happy to hear you liked the workshop :)So about the dates. People put up their possible dates on post its on the imaes and stories we printed and hung uo. I'm in Washinton DC at the moment and cannot access them. But I think Cecile took photos of them. If someone can go through them and aggregate the dates then we can send out a doodle with suggestions for people pick from. @Yannick has them I think...
My sister lives in classical Cité house in Ghent. Cité houses are small, cheap houses that were built for the former poor working classes back in the day. They are mostly built in a way that allows more interaction between the inhabitants. There is a shared open space in the middle, which is free of traffic and is usually filled in with things people chose: tables, barbecues, little gardens, ...The cité where my sister lives is very lively. There are a lot of social interactions because people spend a lot of time outside, organise things together, borrow stuff, etc. Everyone knows everyone.Then again, this is a lot less the case in the cité right next to my sister's. People don't interact that much and the social ties aren't as rich. I'm not sure what causes this, because the same basic elements are there. Does it come down to the people? What do you think?Picture of cité housing:
How can we best get in touch ?  I am enthusiastic to see these topics adressed here.  These are topics I have been interested in over the last years, and would be glad to collaborate. I posted on the edgeryders huis vdh post some time back.  I am based in Brussels. Lets get in touch ! Feel free to email me : dante (dot) monson (at) gmail (dot) comOr add me on fb : https://www.facebook.com/dantegabryellWould be glad to meet in person and further talks from there on ...
Thanks to everyone who made it happen and took all the notes to write this report. It was an inspirational day and it's nice to read everything again!I can't see the Frameadate link in the text @Yannick. I'd love to be there to meet up again.
I apologise for not replying immediately to your comments. You are all giving a double feedback: a) it's an emergent issue the re-working of professions given the BIG changes in the fields of knowledge and sharing at large: b) your comments are of inspiration in developing a wider and/but keen strategy.Yes, there are some first outcomes:a) the open infrastructure was presented at EMEMITALIA,  the national congress on e-Learning that in Modena on september 6thb) next academic year will probably include 7 Master instead of 5 in a open infrastructure and tutors will be trained by a "open" approach;c) least but not last, three trainees (all nurses) are collaborating online to create emojis on healthcare, diagnosis and surgery issues. More to come... Seen your interest it might be useful to share some thoughts and network a bit on such perspective together in a videoconference perhaps..  
Thank you @breathinggames ! It was great and inspiring meeting you at OpenSym, and looking forward to having you at IWEEE, GNU Health Con 2016 this November !
Thank you, @Noemi !South is showing North the benefits of Free Software in Healthcare .  No matter the hemisphere, we have to keep re-inforcing the concepts of Community, Freedom, Independence and Dignity. Many people still have the misconception - and find attractive - about "gratis" and not about "libre".  Whenever we get a request on GNU Health, I spend quite a bit of time making sure that they get the philosophy behind the project. So, the transition is happening, but there is quite a bit of work ahead in the "developed" world, where Health is in the hand of private corporations, far from being public and universal.
We have a particular problem in the UK, which is rising asset prices and particularly land and building prices. This is partly because we are a small crowded island and could do with more houses but it is also because we have an excess of money, and it tends to accumulate in the hands of a minority.In care, the result is that individuals and even the state find it increasingly hard to acquire care homes and they attract private equity and hedge funds who treat staff as human "resources" and patients as "consumers" of health care services, squeezing the system to extract wealth.This is, arguably, an extreme way of presenting the situation (after all, even hedge funds have to employ managers, many of whom are very professional and caring). However the fact is that having "owners" who have different drivers and values from the care-givers causes a tension that too often results in quality of care taking second place to "delivery of health services", which is quite a different thing.A useful parallel is the struggle many communities have to create affordable housing. An interesting and succesful innovation has been the community land trust, where land is acquired by or on behalf of the community and held in trust over the long term. They make the land available for affordable housing. Separating out the ownership of the land from the occupation of the land allows people who couldn't otherwise afford to occupy the land to come in and use it, subject to the conditions set down by the trust. We imagine a similar type of structure.To put it another way, using financial language, owning land has a different time horizon and a different risk profile  from owning a business. A care home that separates the two can attract different sorts of capital for the two different needs, and thus more closely match the interests of the investors with the interests of the stakeholders. That's the theory anyhow.  
Really encouraging to read this, Frederico. I am involved in an emerging group (we call it Caring for Life) looking to acquire care homes in the UK and start to liberate the staff and transform the way care is given. Like you, we are inspired by an open paradigm of care giving, as well as stories of self-managing organisations such as Buurtzorg. It is early days yet but when we have got a bit further, it would be good to hear more about your work and  approach.  
Hallo Vassili,over decades we lost our acces to knowlege, public decision making (if there was ever such a thing?) and there is much need to create a base for organizational intelligence and social decision making. There are some tools available like wikipedia and e-govenance, gut to difficult to manage for the broad society and often higly manipulated by "editors". To find a way for decisionmaking, maintaining bottom up decision making by meta-rules that can be adjusted in an iterative democratic manner and making wisdom available not driven by profit intersts.I wish you good luck, because your issues have a high priority for societal development and as well for a socio-economic development.Bert
It is very important for social, psycological health to change the environment we are living in. Current living environments are a cause for all kinds of problems. So we want to encourage you to design new community and cooprative spaces for living and working.Bert
Hallo Peter!This looks very much like a care model relatet to integral aspects as in "Integral Theory". For insiders there ist not much to mention... you are on the right pass, following the right train of thougt.We do have a simolar model in Mind but not only focussing on health, rather integrating health, learning, knowlege and cohabitation into a larger scheme.So we want to encourage you to not only reserach this and create a virtual environment but work with real communities, who get supported by your ideas.Bert
Just a few thoughts on suboptimality to hopefully drive the discussion around this topic.It is the case from Alberto's comment that "fast, messy, large scale response has to be stopped. Citizens are told to stay home, stay out of the way as the professionals dust off their contingency plans"It seems that this is true in cases where: a) a contingency plan already exists (e.g. Earthquake in Nepal, Disaster Relief in Sub-Saharan Africa) The above examples are plans for disasters that occur frequently and regularly in places that share a geographic similarity or border. It would seem logical to expect that, for example, a disaster relief plan for helping people in Nepal would also be of use if a similar problem occurred in Kashmir, or Bhutan. Since similar types of disaster are likely to occur in those place it makes sense to defer to NGOs on the ground in those areas.But, in order for us to 'leave it to the professional' there have to be NGO's willing, and able to step into that role in the space.What has happened in Greece and Calais is we have seen NGOs step up initially, but then step back from the problem. Often because they cannot work with the changing political situation. I am thinking here of MSF pulling out of Lesvos after the EU-Turkey repatriation deal occurred. (http://www.msf.org.uk/article/why-is-msf-closing-its-moria-project-on-lesvos)The French government's reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Calais camp has created a vacuum. So, NGOs have struggled to work in that area. Because they cannot work under license, they cannot reduce the suffering there, except on a micro scale.Perhaps the idea of sub-optimality in the system comes back to a wider idea. One that is floating around in other areas of the site, that of 'unlicensed behavior'. Once an organisation or NGO becomes 'legitimate', it tends to deal with Governments. It starts to operate at a higher level politically. This brings with it more constraints on the way it can act (at least overtly). It becomes more constrained to do things 'the correct way' and less able to focus on doing what is required.When there isn't a precident for dealing with a disaster on the scale or in that location two options remain. Either improvise or adapt. Both options work with sub-optimality from different directions. The NGO is most likely to adapt. They will find solutions used in other areas, or to address different problems, and adapt them to the new situation. These solutions are 'tried and tested' and so they can point to evidence that shows where they have worked in the past. The NGO avoids looking bad if this approach fails, because they can show ways it has worked before. Their cultural and political capital stays strong and they can work on a new response in the long term. I expect that the lessons learned by MSF et al during this decade's refugee crisis in Europe will lead to contingency plans that will be used around the globe in the future. They struggle to deal with the problem in real time though.At the other end the improviser continually adapts what they are doing to try new solutions. They are willing to try anything. They are willing to fail because they have no social or political capital to diminish, except with the people they work with directly. This means they do not provide a consistent service, but they can evolve new solutions quickly through ongoing prototypes. They risk creating failures, but know that they will move on to another possibility the next day. This behaviour can be seen in the citizen organised projects in Calais and Greece.What is required is a way of feeding the experiences and innovation prototyped by the improvised, citizen-led organisation into the institutional learning of NGOs
Its just not the entry point, since this does not use a linear structure. Or am I misreading your intentions?
and you will generally have the problem of screen size and worse input via keyboard. On the other hand you usually have a camera on the mobile device nowadays. So the direction I would think in mobile access is the following:- image based comments (you take a picture of a sketch + a few words and upload that instead of text), this also allows participation of e.g. illiterate people and complements the predominantly text form data.- try to allow for a very simple yes/no answer function.- another common use case will be 2-3 lines of context explanation and a link (lots of data/info possible with little input)I would love to see hashtags integrated (https://www.drupal.org/project/hashtags) into the #platform at some point as that would allow to restructures conversations. As far as I understand we can use them already - they just don't work yet.
I hoped this could be an entry point gathering information relevant for people starting an open care initiative.  SighI give up
@Noemi I mention @To-Steki in my story but it was before it's participation so I must correct the name and tag it. About 6 months the people from Steki made the delivery of all of those backpacks (that I was preparing) to Eidomeni. And we have had a very good cooperation. By the way, in Thessaloniki there are many active and solidarity groups. In their own way but active and helpful! This list is in greek but maybe you can have an idea.It's a short mapping of Thessaloniki's Municipality area  http://www.thessaloniki.gr/userfiles/file/Dioikisi(NeosOEY)/AytTmEthelNeolaias/LISTA1842016.pdf
I have a blog on my website. What is easiest to do for you to spread the news? What do you need from me? Bloglinks? Newsletter subscription? I blog ca. once a week, newsletter is more like once a month. And on twitter we're already connected :))
We stand ready to diffuse your posts in the Edgeryders network, @ybe – and we would be happy to host them, if you do not have a blog of your own.
Yes, in fact there is a social clinic in Thessaloniki. You can find more info here http://www.kiathess.gr/en/. I shall mention that is a different group from us; although we work together very often. 
Thanks for your nice words!We just have a typical legal existence, as a "Union", in order to be able to sign rent contracts, public services bills etc. But in fact it has nothing to do with our real function and work. We will add a "donate" button in a renewed version of our site that we are building now; as I said, till now, we had no need for such. 
Until i know what connectivity i will have in Ethiopia i can't commit to anything this year. But your hinted suggestion is noted and i'll have a serious think about it.
More power to the arm of anyone who can and will make improvements.I would also benefit from the tool allowing me to jump back into a thread at the point i left it.I'm a strong beliver in John's 'omnivorous' approach to the website. I try to read all of it (even the parts i don't comprehend)
Welcome on board, @To-Steki, I'm curious if the clinic is another initiative or just a metaphor you use? The many informal or established groups you mention makes it seem like Thessaloniki is very busy place (@Aravella_Salonikidou's story confirms this!), it's just that I'm not sure if this is a real physical place or not.. Thanks!
I'll keep you posted :-) . I may be going to Calais as well - via Alex Levene, keep you posted on that too. 
Super-interesting, @To-Steki , thanks for sharing. Can you say more about the legal and organizational structure of the Center? You write that it is "completely self-organised place, depending exclusively on volunteers’ work". But there must be a legal entity behind it, because, as you write "When the Public Electricity Company cut the power in the hostel due to high debt, we reconnected the supply to our name". Who do you mean by "we" in this sentence? Is there a registered Migrants Social Center NGO?I am asking because we found some highly effective groups in Greece who have no legal existence at all: they are just spontaneous aggregations of citizens. I guess your local social solidarity clinic is one of them, certainly there is one in Helliniko, in the Athens area, which we visited last year. Good luck with your efforts! And just one more thing: I could not find a "Donate" link on your website (I can't read Greek, but you have Google Translate integration and a English home page). 
We all stand to learn much from @ybe 's visit to @Aravella Salonikidou . If you could find the time to blog about it, I (and, I think, many others) would be super-interested in reading and commenting. 
Given the scarce resources available to create and improve this site, I think it works pretty well, though it definitely requires you to develop some new habits that are peculiar to this site, as a workaround to some of its inefficiencies.  This applies to the mobile and the desktop interfaces.  I don't use my phone for it, but a lot of people do and the challenges of creating great and sophisticated interfaces on very small screen real estate  are substantial.  As to the "obsolete" comments, there is no reason to get rid of any of the site's history and a lot of reason to keep it.  But to make it so this site is very smart about remembering where you are in any given conversation and taking you directly to it, that is something a smart and dedicated Drupal programmer could create and implement.  Absent the money to insure its creation, we offer encouragement to anyone who wants to take it on.
@ybe hope to see you soon!
In 1977 the South Bronx in New York had the worst healthcare in the country with one doctor per 100,000 people.  It was a time of "white flight" with scores of lareg apartment buildings abandoned by the tenants and then often bured by the owners (or someone) to collect insurance money.  It was the closest the USA has come to an urban environment that resembled many cities in Europe after WWII.At the time I was living at The Farm down south in Tennessee, then the largest colledctive in the country.  It was famous for a lot of reasons, not the least of which was a concentration of hippies and dropouts who looked like typical countercultural stereotypes but were in fact a concentration of highly educated and motivated people.  We used to sometimes say, "don't take over the government.  Take over the government's function."In that spirit, we created a nonprofit organization, Plenty, to do good work in the world. (Plenty still exists and thrives today: plenty.org).  Because we had to provide emergency health care to ourselves (the Farm had more than 1000 people at the time) and because some of those educated people wanted to apply themselves toward meaningful work that was also interesting, we had an unusually large group of EMTs, paramedics, nurses and other health care workers.Seeing how bad things were up in the south Bronx, we decided to go up there and see for ourselves if we could lend a hand.Fast forward to early 1978.  A group of us located a suitable building and squatted in it, fixing it into a livable place. I was part of that early group.(That included converting the coal-buring furnace to a giant woodstove that we fueled by finding leftover wood products in nearby abandoned factories.  I went on may of those firewood runs.  Unforgettable!) My daughter was born in that building, home delivered by one of our Farm midwives.Later that year, Plenty began a free ambulance service to the nearby residents. Soon enough some grant money was procured, equipment bought and the ambulance service kicked into high gear, saving many lives.  The service lasted for six years, until crack and automatic weapons made the place much more dangerous than it already was.  But the good news was that the service had by then embarrassed the city so much by doing what the government was not doing, that the city improved its service to that community.Relevant to this topic: nobody asked for permission to do this.  No permits were applied for or obtained until much later when a lot of publicity was generated, and the city couldn't exactly turn it down.I personally was a small player in this particular saga, and there is much more to the story - it was an incredible experience.  But I remain in awe today at the vision, the guts and the perseverance of the main people driving the project.   It was the spirit of OpenCare at its finest.
Can't disagree with what you write @Village-Psy and the solution found in Calais seems to be training for self care and making your mind catch up with the program somehow. Because I'm sure anyone rational can agree self care is important, but managing emotions and urges is something for another side of your brain..
This sounds very sensible. I am curious about the separation of assets from care activities. Could you say more about why you think that's necessary?
Welcome, @Big Bang Schools . This sounds really promising. I tried to look up your links to find out more about your initiative. Unfortunately I can't read Greek, so I don't know more now than I did before. If you were to point out the main difference between Bog Bang Schools and ordinary schools, what would it be? 
@Jenny Gkiougki , have you already met @Matthias and the Epelia crowd? I think you have much in common, and may even find ways to work together. They want to be an online market place for products like the one you are already interested in. Let us know if you want an introduction. 
So, what we have here is:A peer-to-peer support group of mental health patients and caregivers.Which formed with the idea to give out recommendations for improving HSE (state-provided) services.But which ended up having to take on the role of innovators and start prototyping stuff, as institutional response was slow.And reconfigured itself in the context of the process through which Galway has re-invented itself to bid (successfully) for European Capital of Culture 2020.With its main ally so far being not a hospital or a clinic, but an Arts Museum. It is paradoxical and completely logical at once! I guess, in its own way, this is fairly typical of the idiosyncratic paths taken by communities of care. You work with the tools you find lying around, and they might be highly specific of your place and time. ECOC processes have one thing going for them: they do encourage everyone in the bidding city to think as a local community, like a piece of a local system. Maybe it made it more natural for a group interested in mental health issues and an arts museum to form an alliance. 
Hi there, I will try to answer you briefly and to the point as I just got back from hospital and I need my rest. For the situation with CSAs in Greece please read my report here http://urgenci.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Overview-of-Community-Supported-Agriculture-in-Europe-F.pdf As for AFDS in Thessaloniki, as we said our project is still underway and nowhere near its end, but I can say that there is a vast array of different projects ranging from 100% legitimised cooperatives to completely informal groups tending a small garden feeding the poor and refugees. And new initiatives are springing up all the time. It is a truly exciting endeavour mapping them all.  I hope this covers your questions :)
@ Noemii agree that self care has become a luxury for volunteers (no time, too many tasks to tackle , unprecedented situations) especially under circumstances such as the one Alex @Levene desribes in Calais, but let us not forget of the burnt out effect. And when we reach that stage we are of  no help to anyone.... Self care should not be a luxury.  As volunteers, we are  human beings who need the basics to get by, we need water,  food, shelter , sleep , safety and human contact but  in order to carry on we also need to know where to draw our limits. We are not superhuman, we cannot do everything, we cannot do everything by ourselves.In Lesvos and many other of the Greek islands flooding with refugees this past year, numerous young idealistic volunteers arrived from all over Europe wanting to make a difference in the lives of others. Some of these individuals under the circumstances, after a few weeks, not being able to bear the situation, which was physically but above all mentally exhausting ended up, being burnt out and rather than provide help  required themselves psychological  assistance. This was ultimately very distracting for the rescue teams and those providing PFA who needed to focus on the refugees instead.   I guess what i am saying is selfcare in whatever form it takes,  is a prerequisite in order to be able to carry on the difficult task of volunteering in such harsh conditions otherwise you may be burnt out . 
A network of the people who participated in village psy, encounters in psychotherapy ,has been established after the first encounter this summer, who continue  to communicate with each other through social media, so contact is ensured, along with an  ongoing exchange of ideas.Some, we hear, who live in the same cities,   have had  the chance to meet up since August. However since, participants are spread all over Greece and some live abroad,  getting everyone together  before the next venture is difficult. There is an idea, based on demand,of a smaller scale  experiental workshop encounter in 'the village' , a sort of follow up, in a few months time for those who can attend.The idea of community  and belonging  can somehow be maintened through social networking for some time , but ultimately the natural environment and the physical encounter are crucial for a longterm positive outcome , as they are  an essential part of the therapeutic process .
@Village-Psy maybe you can help us understand why self care is so expensive for one to offer it to herself. Have you read about the 24/7 caregivers who simply can't switch off? If you have something to offer to that discussion and would be willing to head over there it would be very well received.
I may have missed the point.. I get they are older comments, but why obsolete?@Alberto: I assigned the wiki to both the Research group and Op3n Community group, would that work? Or do you need it to be specifically a Challenge Response content type? I thought we're also coding *parts* of the content in Research - i.e. case studies we shared frugally, or conceptualizations of opencare etc..@Alex Levene: great comment above, sharing your personal experience while really relating to other's. Spoken like a true peer and community manager (hint hint :-)  @johncoate would approve I think, wouldn't you John? 
hi @Alex Levene , nice to meet you, I dont understand if your long post is a rant defending defects but I think this motivations overrules personal opinionshttps://edgeryders.eu/en/edgeryders-dev/task-6800 
We're in time to make it better, and run with similar stuff in the future!  
Hey @Frodizo team, welcome to Edgeryders and many thanks to @Pavlos for inviting you.You seem to place a lot of focus on partnering or complying with government regulations, why is that needed if you are providing services at home? is it only to gain the trust of the people needing the services?I think your 6 month cycle activities are brilliant for getting structured and stopping to evaluate. I've seen a similar initiative in COSAIN, an Irish initiative which is also community led and where authors are skillfully building a support base among formal care providers, communities in need and an unexpected large share of therapeutic art caregivers, which is very interesting - for the proof of concept they are using a museum's space once a week. I strongly encourage you to go in and say hello!
i see the seeds of complexity langiage transformed in a real approach.this is a music which i never heard before  this is a lot of academic gold transofmerd not into bla bla but in a real opportunity.i am not saying it is perfect, i am nto sayd it will be working ;-)but it is the best attempt i know 
Hi @Village-Psy, What followup do you provide/offer to ensure longterm positive outcomes?  
Hi @ybe, Have you considered providing trauma healing for cops? They are the ones who inflict much of the trauma in my area and they could use a big dose of emotional processing!
Ok, @ybe , it might be the wrong question. People do what they do. The question is: is this impulse towards care reliable enough that we can factor it into project design? Are we looking at a sort of "If we build it, they will come" of community care initiatives?
Hi @Jenny Gkiougki and welcome! It seems to me from reading you and @Pavlos that there are very active groups at the network level trying to promote new agendas for food production and consumption. And more so, for more cooperative frameworks like @ChristineSa . What have you discovered in your mapping, which are the initiatives running food alternative systems?Also, how are existing CSA schemes in Greece working? I'm guessing even at informal levels there are some, and I'm a fan of the model although I've seen in practice how hard it is to sustain itself in terms of long term trust and ability of consumers to deal with less good crops.   
Thanks for sharing the links, from the ministry's communication I picked up on something new: "The question of women's employment is thus closely linked to the question of the social organization of care work" So the risk is that the more care work you do around the house, the more you risk being paid less because of inability to take up fulltime work and provide for yourself at an old age..?On the other side, unpaid care work it's somehting many of us do in our lives - out of love, pleasure, even a sense of duty as Alex pointed out in his story of refugee volunteering. For a lot of people care - and I've seen older generation women in my family, care is indeed something they "can't switch off" from because it is where they find meaning in their lives. After retiring, they, and not their husbands were the ones who were able to take on paid care roles (eg caring for small children) as those skills remain valued at an old age. Indeed underpaid, and yet the only surplus income in the family. Do other policies like paternal leave work in Germany? In Romania it's currently at only 10% of fathers taking it :-(  
@OrangeHouse welcome to Edgeryders, we are honored!Your story is providing interesting answers to questions we were posing a few months with @Luisa @Natalia_Skoczylas and others - how to convince people in our close circles, let alone the broader community, to drop the fear of the unknown which is often at the very core of racist or xenophobic reactions. It seems you figured out a good way - by showing things. Then no arguments or fights needed..
Thanks for letting me know @Alex Levene. I have corrected the link could you please retry?(I think I was to quick saying nice things about google docs, I keeps giving error messages  tonight)
Personally I find this site/wiki is born messy and I propose turning to a google document solutionhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=125lKsi-Wm4Gq0AWkIEHD2SAOGaiiV9C8VykS1bf-JzcPlease join in. I have already started inserting headlines and comments from @Noemi, @Woodbinehealth, @steelweaver 
Hi Rune, we haven't engaged in any dicussion before, so i realised i should 'officially' say hello and welcome.It's really great that you're keen to help develop and improve the way the ER site works for users. Definitely a positive place to be. My ignorance in all areas 'code' is a large stumbling block. My skills are more in the soft/event arena.
Hi Rune,I understand your frustration with the site, when i first came to Edgeryders i found that it was rather labyrinthine and not structured towards easy comprehension. The site has undergone a number of iterations to get to where it is now and i think that we have a site that is much smoother and more aesthetically pleasing than when i joined the community a year ago.I agree that the mobile access is a problem, and it seems there are people working in the background to solve that. My view is that when i log in on my mobile i just want to read a comment or post. I'm probably not going to sit and write a response on my phone because i prefer to think deeply about my responses and respond in depth. My view is that i don't need to site to act as a social media platform. I want depth of field, not speed here.I quite like that the 'obsolete comments' remain in the system. Every few weeks i spend a day digging through the old projects, conversations etc on the site. It helps me see how things have developed and where the issues have been. I gain a much greater understanding of the path, the battles and the 'big picture' when i get lost down the old blind alleys and dead ends. I think if we moved to a position where we only showed the finished product and not the working out we are giving a false impression, plus i imagine it would have negative impacts on both the 'openness' and the ability to analyse and extract quality data from the platform. But i wouldn't know anything about that specifically as i'm not a computer network scientist. I'm a poet and creative producer.I too am a big fan of the Google Docs set up. We use it to set up some of the Culture Team documents, and i think Alberto has had some successes using it for the OpenandChange application. It seems to work best for input from between 4-5 active collaborators though. I do think that it does decrease the number of people who engage with the document and there are some on ER that are disincentivised to use Google products. Where input is wanted from as many people as possible i think the messy solution on the site is still best for collecting that information from everyone.Those are my initial thoughts on your points. The Google docs link doesn't connect to a file so i can't participate in the process much further right now.
@Alberto, I understand the point perfectly. Sorry. The issue is that I have evaluated how much time (40-80 hours) I have spent in edgeryderspace, and as I see it the site needs rethinking.1. Its impossible to view and edit on mobile (and  It has severe accessibility problems, but thats another issue)2. I really get lost in conversations because obsolete comments remains. 3. I've just started working with living documents and I have already esperiences of extreme effectiveness in collaborating online with google docs (hate to say they really got it right where M$ got it wrong)The plan is to upload the content of the doc here if possible. Until then I went for a practical solution to get things done now.What do you think? 
Idea for discussion: OpenCare.CC could provide a ‘hub’ for triage of people seeking OpenCare solutions and who to contact@ybecasteleyn@skynet.be @alberto.cottica@gmail.com 
 Yes the Bagmati does have its issues but it's cultural importance is intriguing. The residents of Kathmandu have been cleaning up the banks of the river for the past 150 Saturdays and they have not missed a single Saturday yet even during the earthquake which is  it is remarkable. Yes I think that the arts has a way of bringing together a lot of different groups and using aesthetics is a way to introduce complicated issues  in a accessible manner. 
@Natalia Skoczylas haha yes, Bagmati is unforgettable … I have a lively memory of this (stench on the) bridge above Bagmati on our usual cycle ride to Sanepa :DAnd @albertorey , about your initiative: the arts may indeed prove to be a key to get collective organizing going for river protection and cleanup. Example in question: I'm following a community in Mumbai doing regular cleanups on a local beach. They pulled some 3000 metric tons of plastic garbage from the ocean, but obviously the city always provides more. So back in July, a friend from Mumbai was looking for ways to catch the garbage while it's carried in the river and before it reaches the shore, and together we found this barrier boom technology, produced locally in India by a company from Bangalore. So the tech part is solved in principle (and the barrrier can even be installed in a way that lets boats pass.) But we are at a loss how to organize people to get this thing purchased (or DIY made) installed. After reading about your approach, it seems to me that an arts and documentary project could be the missing social catalyst in a case like this. Showing people the progress they have made already, and how a river barrier is the logical next step for a lasting solution. Well, or that people stop littering, but let's be realistic for the near term :)
@Aravella Salonikidou I plan to visit Greece in december 2016 / January 2017 - I can stay a month or so   
"grief is a form of disability..."I think this is a very interesting suggestion Patrick, that may benefit from great insight.I also read a very interesting acticle about how it is often harnessed by communities to help deliver change as well:http://www.slate.com/articles/life/cover_story/2016/09/pulse_and_the_power_of_lgbtq_grief.htmlWell worth a read
I think there's a lot to be said about suboptimality when it come to care and response. I will have a think and put some words together for you.
It did already happen! For the first time in 2016, but only online and in german. Nevertheless we got great responses and media coverage, support by lots of people, who posted their positions on this subject and a supporting statement from the german Ministry for Family Affairs. So 'Equal Care Day, 29.2.' seems to be an established day in certain circles, but of course we'd like more people to know about it, to discuss it, to raise awareness to the lack of appreciation of care work - so now we're looking forward to 29.2.2020, and hope to find fellows who spread the idea to other countries and sponsors to organize a live event on this special day.
Hi, Totally agree with this. The situation in Calais has the added edge that most of the aid agencies operating there are UK based charities, but they are working in France. There is a need to try to work alongside local authorities (or be seen to) because we are 'outsiders/foreigners' and 'interfering'Keeping the refugees in the community as a central part of the planning and decision making is a core part of the management though. Many of us wish there could be a better, more permanent way of dealing with this situation. But right now getting either the French or UK governments to actually accept that these people are not just going to disappear into the air, well, that's almost impossible.
This. Over and over again. I'm an avid supporter of Cosain and look forward to returning to Galway soon! 
@BLOODe welcome on board, it's lovely to meet you!What you do is different than volunteering, you do entrepreneurship which I know - from working with Edgeryders - takes all of one  because it involves coordination, management, comms all at once and by limited number of people. Do you manage to cover the costs of the logistics of your work? What about paying yourselves for the hard work? 
@Noemi , transforming the node away from challenge response makes it disappear from the ethnography. In theory it can be brought back in by assigning it to the Op3nCare Community, but when I do that I lose comments. Ideas?
I hope that you find a way to help us understand all these contradictory evolutions. 
Hi, similar approach and initiatives have been taken in Greece, by many solidarity groups, which try to avoid any connection and dependence from state and formal NGOs, trying to distinct between solidarity and charity, A very crucial factor on this issue is the participation of the refugees (or other groups supported). 
Dear @steelweaver, I do appreciate your references, but cochrane reviews are better in supporting the statements. Personally I have proposed some studies but apparently 'scientific approach' is disturbing the 'chi'. However we surrender to a universal law 'effectiveness is the measure of truth'  and we have a moral obligation to strive for the most effective treatment (leave the measure of effectiveness open for now) regardless of our personal beliefs, hopes and dreams. What I'm getting at here is that OpenCare should also consider establish a serious approach with double scope: avoiding infiltration of quackery and protect us from accusations of quackery.  What I'm asking the community for is to contribute with ideas of how to implement EBM in our approach, as in your clinic?What I think we can offer each other within OpenCare is the solution to "can't afford to hire a medical research team", surely we have the skills in this comunity. So lets help each other. I've started a cook book over here 
Hi, in Greece, many solidarity groups the last years have been cooking on the street for homeless or refugees. Especially the previous year, when thousands of refugees have crossed greece to move on other european countries, solidarity groups in islands, Eidomeni (on the borders with Makedonia) and city centers have cooked for them, or helped them cooking by themeselves. Nowadays, after borders close-down, the refugees remained in camps try also to enrich their poor meals by cooking with self-designed apparatus. 
Thank you @Rune! The article on the polio is quite an interesting read.
@ybe I'd like to know when will you visit Greece. I think it will be helpfull for the team. 
Dear @ybe, can I propose that we do the discussion in a shared document, i'll send you the link. Then it could evolve into some structured persitent document serving others sharing our thoughs?Others wanting to join, please send me a message. 
Nice post @Vassilis Giannakopoulos - SciFY Id like to know more about how you do it (the report seems to be missing) thats why we propose the WeHandU initiative, Maybe we could collaborate?How do you 'recruit' your 'clients'?
Hello @DavidFromAntwerpthanks to share your concern about this topic. On saturday we are organizing a workshop between people who want to better the system around care by sharing their vision and focus. Your imput would be wonderfull. If you can participate send me a message. All info can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/events/280924708934187/ 
I found this an interesting read. I remember meeting someone recently, an ex-soldier, who lost her leg in Iraq. Initially I felt awkward about acknowledging the (obvious) fact of her disability - but once I started talking to her, it felt natural to ask her whether she was still able to go running (something she had said she used to enjoy). Actually she said that her false limb was so good that she could still enjoy running. It felt very good to talk ina natural way about her disability.In speaking to her, I was encouraged by a memory of my experience many years ago, when someone close to me died. Afterwards, many close friends found it really difficult to talk about it with me - yet I was more than happy to talk about it, indeed it felt very unnatural not to. I suppose, in some ways, grief is a form of disability...Anyway, thank for posting.
@sucreblue it is lovely to read you, welcome to the community, and to OPENandChange bid - I saw you are formally onboard.From the description of the service being peer-led I understand that the people doing the screenings, the caregivers are trained citizens? Or do they have medical background? I'm asking because the first makes for a model we keep seeing and others are advocating for similar ones - where building alternatives to systems means training ourselves into becoming carers. Because the systems are understaffed or too rigid to provide low cost access to treatments with low overhead.You should definitely go in and meet the people at @concrn training community dispatchers for the homeless, or at @MAZI fighiting depression together. Or closer to home - how building cheap eco-coolers from plastic bottles helps people cope with heat. They are all community led solutions.
Hi @careday-team, welcome. Did this happen already or is it an idea?I can see the argument working in some communities more than as a general campaign - for example where this care gap is degenerative in that it correlates with lack of self confidence in women, or housework burnout, or even domestic violence in the worst cases..  I haven't done awareness raising campaigns, but it could be that for the impact you're looking for a deep value based argument would be more easily turned around by anyone with a difft agenda.   If you can insert links to the stats or numbers you're referencing it would be great!
Hi @DavidFromAntwerp my name is Noemi, and my story has more problems than solutions.Is there anything that you are working on at the moment where Edgeryders can be of help? Right now many conversations here revolve around the question of how can groups of people and communities take better care of each other, with members sharing bits of their work or projects and hoping to find answers and advice. Have a look at the collection and see if there's something which interests you?
GNU Health is a sister initiative which we discovered at the Open Source Initiative and some time later at the Internation Symposium on Open Collaboration.GNU Health concept is simple as free software: all people should collaborate to build a common of knowledge instead of building competitive, exclusive systems that hinder access to healthcare services of quality. GNU Health ensures that the different therapists and doctors who follow our children have the best available information about them, so that they can provide the best advices for the best health outcomes.Thanks for all efforts put in developing this project!
Sensorica has had a major impact on our initiative, not only by having engineers and passionate jack-of-all-trade help us create an open source breathing device, but also by showcasing a sustainable and transparent model for redistributing raised fund, which we adopted. We are looking forward to this adventure.
Wow, @Michel , that seems to be a difficult problem. Infrastructure as basic as what you describe for Madagascar is out of my experience (I lived in Europe my whole life). All I can say is that the whole opencare thing is really not relying on government. The stories you read here are all stories of self-sufficiency somehow. Education, peer to peer, in a developing country: this sounds like a project @Matthias is developing in Nepal. He calls it "pocket university". Matt, do we have a link to the idea yet?
@Matthias Look, don't you miss the smell of Bagmati ?:)
You are probably not asking me, @Luisa (what do I know about the Parks and Open Spaces Department in Berlin, apart from the fact that its nam is probably one really long German word?). But if you can pull it off, an informal, safe discussion between the authorities and the people is very valuable. If you have a courageous politician or senior public officer at hand, you could ask her to come along as facilitator; the Parks people would feel authorized to attend because she is there, and they could have a chat off the record. But you need the right person. 
@Louisa good luck with your idea!  I've had something like this in mind but I didn't find enough funs for this Urban Cooking. You can have a formal green light if the municipality (or whatever) agrees and then you can organise the routine part like informal just for the atmosphere. In Greece we have strict rules (only in papers) about public spaces but every municipality has special Regulatory Decisions. The municipality services inform about the legality and in cooperation with the councilors or/and the citizens apply the final idea. Did you ask the topical authorities about that? 
> every one of those terms has an ideology behind itAbsolutely correct.Over the past eight years, in addtion to other duties as a manager of an organization, I administered the health care benefit for my employees.  This all took place during the whole Obamacare/socialized medicine debate.As you know, in politics, one gets ahead by identifying and demonising a bad guy.  In that debate the bad guys were the health insurance companies.  Plenty of blame to go around with that group, no question.But in shopping for the best plans, I noticed something interesting.  If we opted for a plan where the pharmaceudicals were all generic, the premiums for each employee was reduced by half.  By half!  No other cost reduction option even came remotely close to that.  So, if half the expense is going to the drug companies for their proprietary drugs, then shouldnt they have figured a little more heavily in the national debate?  (Actually it did with one candidate - Bernie Sanders.)  One would think, but in my view, that would have complicated things too much for the huge numbers of people who need everything in the public sphere dumbed down so they can grasp it.  (I hate to say such things because it sounds so elitist, but after decades of involvement with the public dialogue I can't avoid that conclusion.)
in certain ways.  Millions of not very bright people who derive their understanding of the world through a mix of TV and their own predjudices and assumptions view the healthcare status quo as being one where they have more individual choice.  (Obanacare = socialism and "death panels.") Over here that is like a core religious belief, so if you can convince people they will have fewer choices then it isn't that hard to get them to oppose it, even though it is not in their economic interest to do so.  Indeed the fact that Ronald Reagan got elected largely with the support of such people is a perennial case in point.
I can't speak to places like Germany and Sweden, but the numbers of refugees in most EU countries are very low compared to the overall population - and the ones who managed to get there tend to be younger and more able, so not placing huge demands on health care per se.That's an interesting point about the apoliticality of Open Care - in the party political sense, of course it should not be aligned with a particular side. But if politics just means 'how we organise things in our society', then it is very much political - and if it does bring about significant change, it's bound to be seen as such by some people.A current example - kind of the opposite to Obamacare - are the moves in the UK by the current government to privatise aspects of the NHS. They will say that it is not about political ideology, it's just about being more 'efficient' and using 'the invisible hand' of market forces to drive costs down, and that we can't afford not to in a time of 'austerity' - but every one of those terms has an ideology behind it; assumptions and values about what healthcare is, what a society is, what government is for, etc.
It is true that space and care intertwine. At least, this seems to be the experience in Edgeryders. The kitchen was a fundamental infrastructure in the unMonastery; and @Luisa and @Cindy P. , while wondering how to support refugees, both have found that cooking is fundamental to care (one, two) Even in my own home, at the second iteration we acquired two fully functional kitchens, but we decided to only ever to use one of them, because this leads more naturally to us mingling, chatting, spending time together. I even put music equipment and computers on the work surfaces and the stove of the unused kitchen, to make sure no one is tempted to use it! :-)
maybe this is part of an answer:It is for me ... making a difference for someone makes me feel profoundly human, part of humanity ... I think connecting, helping, supporting, caring restores humanity in us, in the other and in the world
placing increased demands on health care - and the budgets that support it - it it not becoming more politicised in the EU?Also, Open Care is a distinctly apolitical effort, but after it gains some traction both specifically and as a meme that propagates, I see a danger in attempts at co-opting or using it by political forces wanting to channel the narrative - and the money - to a particular agenda.  Of course this is from someone in the US where everything is political on some level.
Thanks, @Alberto, you are right, I was mostly thinking of the UK example, and the way in which healthcare at the point of delivery is seen as a neutral, technocratic institution. The recent junior doctors' strike shows the same pattern: doctors being criticised for 'politicising' healthcare, as if everything about it is not already political.But I would venture [not living there, but observing from afar] that there is a similar issue in the US - people think of the status quo as 'normal' and don't see that it already has a political dimension, so attempts to disrupt the massively wasteful insurance/medical cartel [as Obamacare made some small steps to do] come up against lots of resistance even from people who might benefit from change.
I may be way off the mark here (I am not British), but I think @steelweaver is thinking of the way the Leave campaign in the recent Brexit referendum used NHS funding as am electoral promise to sell their product: "Support us, and there will be more money for health care!". They can do this because everybody agrees that funding public health care is a good thing. In this sense, even though it's still entangled with politics in complex ways, public health care as a principle is bipartisan in the UK. Italy is the same: it's part of our identity. Attacks do not come from groups trying to defund it, but from groups trying to parasitize it, for example supplying it with (super-expensive, proprietary) equipment. We (Italians, possibly the British too) do not think of health care as political because it's not divisive as a basic choice. I appreciate ours is not a sophisticated position.
This is not just informative, it's literary. And I sometimes wonder if you don't need the beauty for the information to hit home.As I read about the volunteers life in The Jungle, I am brought back to an impression I have had all through this opencare project. The impression is this: "the economy", "society", the world we know is only paper thin. Behind the surface of carbonated drinks and targeted advertising and employment figures and pre-election rallies, I glimpse self-organisation reaching out for ways to cater to our needs. It seems like it percolates through the crack of society, colonizing immediately any area that "the economy" retreats from. This could be why there are so many great stories from Greece coming through; Helliniko and @OrangeHouse , @Aravella Salonikidou and her strange "not some social space", @MAZI , @Tree of Life , @To-Steki , @Jenny Gkiougki , @Noesi ... Greece has suffered more than most countries, and yet there is so much resilience.Mayble another world is not just possible, it's inevitable. Maybe these communities are humanity's default configuration, and we are only held in place in large hierarchical system by massive dissipation, and even then just about. Volunteers in The Jungle are sad, broken, exhausted. Why don't they go home? "We feel responsible", says Alex. Not good enough. Why do you feel responsible? Humans seem to be naturally building mutual help communities. Why? What are we missing? 
"Obamacare" is arguably the number one political debate along with immigration and national security.Another aspect is student loans.  For years students have taken out loans to attend universities.  For years the government set low interest rates and wasn't aggressive in going after delinquent accounts.  That changed some years ago and those loans are now both very expensive and likely to scar your entire working life if you don't pay them on time.  I submit that is has a chilling effect on people seeking careers in medicine and health care at the higher levels.  And it is certainly a huge reason why there is such a shortage of general practitioners compared to specialists.  A GP has to take many more years to pay off their student debt.I could go on and on.  But the point is that it is impossible to separate health care from the political debate in the US, and probaly everywhere else.
What a wonderful job you're doing. Having experience in the health system we know how frustating can be to see how people can suffer and die from deseases that could be trated. What can be done in order to make these communities sustein themselves?!
What an inspiring story, @MAZI.Thank you so much to share it. Knowing many people soffering from depression and knowing how they can be judged in the wrong way, it's very refereshing to see there is hope out there. How can people get in touch with you?
Hello and welcome, @Tree_of_Life. This seems really intriguing. It looks like your group is not zeroing in one one purpose ("we repair old computers that were being thrown away and donate them to local schools", but rather try to help each other live fulfilling lives. From collecting shoes to theatre, excursions to workshops you seem to be doing a lot of things, focusing on the people in the group rather than on any one activity.Additionally, it seems you are listing yourselves (the parents) among the beneficiaries. This also very intriguing, and close to the vision we are pursuing with opencare: people self-organize in communities to take care of each other. These are impressions based on this post. Did I get it more or less right? I checked out your links, but as I cannot read Greek I could not get any extra information. :-)
What an interesting project. I really don't know much about these kind of experinces but what I would really like to know is how people get in touch with you and how do they decide to become part of a community? Do they stay for a long time? Are there any children that grew up and then moved away? Do you get any financial help from the government? Thank you!
"Healthcare is largely seen as a 'value-neutral', apolitical issue, and it's so important to put it back in its political context"Couldn't agree more with you here. Certainly, given what is happen in the UK at the moment it is really important that both the wider community and the medical professionals themselves understand that they stand in a highly politicised space. I think it's time we stopped demanding our doctors and medical practitoners pretend they somehow exist outside of the politcal world around them
Hey everyone, thanx for your comments!Our group is based in Thessaloniki but it is connected with a global network of tools and projects with the vision to expand an alternative and fair economy through cooperation, or let’s say to create sustainable economic solutions through cooperativism. In Greece there is already many cooperatives, especially created as a result of the economic crisis, either under a legal form or remaining informal, and we want to support their networking as well as to expand the network through creating new cooperative initiatives.One of the tools to connect those and at the same time to untie ourselves from the banking system is alternative currency networks and FairCoin is already doing this on a global level. However the currency is just a tool, what is most important is the vision and the values that incorporate the efforts. In Thessaloniki, we started quite recently but there is already some places that joined and we hope to see more of them joining very soon. In Greece there is more places in Athens and the island of Crete, where FairCoin is further connected to the local currency of Herakleion. @Noemi you can find a global directory with all the places using FairCoin here.@WinniePoncelet this is certainly not an easy task, especially when the effort is being made on a global scale and you are trying to create change in a global scale. But we hope that cooperation can help with all the progress. The biggest challenge I see is trust and empowerment, people to trust each other and believe that collectively they can change things. So trust to each other and trust to collective power, rather than being disconnected and antagonistic. From so many sides we are being trained to not trust each other and our collective power, but I believe that culture is gradually changing and people are becoming more inclined to create communities and cooperate. Technology and to a certain extent the economic crisis have supported that.@Simonedb I agree with you that it is extremely important to remain open to other ideas and projects, and this is why we were so happy to participate at the Edgeryders workshop in Thessaloniki where we met this amazing community of people! At the same time, it is also important to have clear values and objectives, so that people trust you. So openness, cooperation and values can go a long way and can bring very creative results, especially on a large or global scale.I invite people interested in our efforts to visit FairCoop’s website and if you wish to be more actively involved or have ideas to share, please leave a message or join our telegram groups which we use for networking and communication, by sending an e-mail to: coop@fair.coop!PS: @Noemi, I don’t think we have met before, do you mean the Festival of Solidarity and Cooperative Economy in Athens? I have been there, but since I live in Thessaloniki I am not part of the organizing team. However our group here is connected with the people in Athens and also people organizing the festival. There is another Christina among them so perhaps this is who you mean? :)
So inspiring to read you @MAZI. I especially liked that group facilitators are trained group members and that someone can step into different roles, even skill up in a process that difficult. There are no expert lectures and no self-pity parties. -well said. @kate g, another edgeryder, said something similar about  how conversation in which neither party is an expert can be lifechanging.I'm curious about the group which seems more or less open - can anyone who reports feeling down or unable to cope join you? Considering how difficult it is to make that step due to the fear and stigma attached, are you making any prior efforts to invite people in or signal somehow that this is a different approach?
Hi @Aravella,  Alternative school is never been taken before.  The Malagasy government was hiring some substitutionals teachers five-year ago to give some help others teachers, it was efficient,but fact is they're still unpaid since 7 mouths, about solidarity teachers is quite far if they don't get hired or paid again.  Some parts of Madagascar doesn't get electricity yet, Internet access is limited and expensive sometime.  Communal Library is rare, there are old books since 70's to 90's sometime  no book but lot of dust and ruins. 
"It is really like a house, not like a social service type of place. "Welcome, @OrangeHouse . You capture beautifully the spirit of opencare. And yes, you need salsa teachers and roof gardeners to deal with the, ahem, refugee crisis. And acupuncturists, like @steelweaver , and trauma therapists like @ybe , and actors and poets like @Alex Levene . I think @Thom Stewart and the Galway crowd would also enjoy the story... There seems to be something going on in the background: you are not being stopped, even though you are definitely in some kind of semi-legal grey area. The story of the Helliniko Metropolitan Community Clinic is similar: no legal entity, but the authorities look the other way (in fact they cooperate, unofficially). There are definitely some humane and brave bureaucrats at work in the Greek public sector! 
Thessaloniki has the right size for mapping and get results quickly. The people who care know each other. Due to refugee wave they gained more experience and identified common problems.@Pavlos I've lost your workshop but we 'll help this mapping anyway. Thank you!
I'm happy for this Orange House! I thing here in Thessaloniki we don't have something like this. A "copy paste" is not possible when we talk about people but your advices could be very helpful. How can we follow and share your project?
Hi @Mishel! What about alternative schools? Solidarity teachers and maybe school from distance. Through radio or internet if it's possible. And not only typical lessons but also music, dance, poetry e.t.c. What about libraries in Magadascar?
I haven't come across that exact technique - a quick google suggests it is a modified version of EFT suitable for people with more acute trauma.What I have heard from colleagues [and here] is that these tapping techniques work, but mostly because the tapping helps to distract/reorient the system to allow the trauma to be released, rather than because it is a specifically effective sequence of acupuncture points.That said, acupuncture points are areas that initiate particularly high physiological responses, so if you are going to be tapping yourself, arguably you might as well do it on acupuncture points to get an even better effect. And doing a sequence of points in all the areas of the body will ensure that no forgotten area retains the tension of the trauma.In short - it's probably worth giving it a try!
This really spoke to me. Healthcare is largely seen as a 'value-neutral', apolitical issue, and it's so important to put it back in its political context, and to see that our attitudes towards it are framed by the wider values of our society. It looks like Woodbine are doing some great work on this.Attitudes towards alternative medicine are a case in point - not only is there resistance from the medical institutions [often ignoring solid evidence supporting the practice], but ordinary people pick up on that and are averse to being involved with something that doesn't have the approval of the medical 'authorities'.I wonder if the Woodbine folk have encountered any resistance to 'woo' things like TCM and Feldenkrais, and if so, how they have overcome this?I should also put in a shout for the Chinese tradition of Yang Sheng - non-industrialised health practices that aren't just about physical fitness, and that can be suitable for those recuperating or without full physical mobility.If you have a community library, Peter Deadman's latest might make a great addition - not only does it cover a whole range of areas [general health, pregnancy, ageing, etc] but it cites lots of western science to back up the older eastern practices. 
@steelweaver, as an acupuncturist, do you know this tapping technique: http://peacefulheart.se/trauma-tapping-technique and do you think it is effective?
Thx @steelweaver for your comment. As for the somatic apporach, I totally agree. I often use somatic experiencing, especially for chock trauma. Before going to Calais, I need to look up soms good group exercices for the volunteers. Suggestions welcome.
Hi @Alberto, and thanks for a great and inspiring post, @ybe!A couple of examples of previous models spring to mind:- People used Somatic Experiencing techniques with survivors of the Boxing Day tsunami, and with social service workers after Hurricane Katrina, with some success. Here's a nice TV spot on it being used in a group setting post-Japan earthquake.- Somatherapy was developed during the military junta in Brasil as a combination of psychotherapy, capoeira and anarchist theory. It favours use of enjoyable, play-based physical activities and emphasises placing individual mental health within the larger political context.Predictably enough, given my day job, my bias is towards body-based practices, or at least forms of psychotherapy that incorporate some aspect of physical engagement - I don't know if @ybe already incorporates these ideas in her practice, and in any case other forms of psychotherapeutic intervention are also very effective.But the advantages of this kind of approach, as I see it, are:- They engage with the somatic anchoring of trauma, bringing quick results.- The physical nature of the practices can help overcome language difficulties, which might be useful in a scenario like Calais.- They can be applied efficiently in a group setting - rather than waiting their turn to speak, everyone engages in the practices at once.- Because individuals can continue to use the exercises outside the therapy session, fewer sessions are necessary, meaning lower costs and/or more people can be seen.- Somatherapy in particular also emphasises the importance of group work as part of building a community of solidarity and support in the face of potentially oppressive political situations; moving beyond reliance on external care to develop personal and political assertiveness.Of course, acupuncture is also used extensively in relation to trauma, either alone or as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Organisations like World Medicine run multibed acupuncture projects in places affected by natural disasters, war and poverty. I know of at least one British acupuncturist treating people in the Calais camp, but perhaps @Alex Levene would know more about that. 
one big asnwer. i - we dont wanna say we are the best, we are the benchmakr. we failed a lot of times. becasue mainly co-living takes time and it is not a professional activity. this is not a community like organization that lives as a whole, it is the sum of families which tried to improve a better way of living in a light way. so no huge ambition was inside it, so i feel that everything that happen is like a miracle, even with all the troubles and limitation increased also by the economic crises that hit so many of us here.the very very starting point was a private real estate project that used co-hpusing as amktg attractor, but then the community create and organised itself, even because the company disappered afterselling - here my comments abot hard to relie on biz people fo these kind, we should develop out own independent way to create this places, everybody bought home, no rent was possibile, but..why not.microwelfare. we sill live in a "normal way"...but we share time, infromation, products,  skills, decision maing on shared purchases...anycase it is a light version of what you think.we acted on single issues like local areas transformation together with other gourps, we hosted meeting people, activties of other assocaition and took aprt in them.infromal relatioship with neightbour people/family also nice. we had a purchase group for quite a whilelocal government is burocratic-politics and slow, almost no budget...also here we have many lesson learned also about mistakes. other groups came here to get inspiration, infromation and advise about to form themself. few manged to do it. politecno of milan use us a good case to show what can be done as a minimum.we had never had greater ambitions becasue it would need a lot of time..but with open and care some of us feel that we can finally give a stronger contribuition 
ability to go beyoind it , sense making, strnght, strong eliefe these are the words that i felt more powerful adn fitting to the video and the project description.i feel the strength of a group with a shared mission and vision, soemthing that is strongly missing the modern individualistic society, and by the way it is based on a shared concrete experience of care.this is many many are looking for as a way to sense making postmodernity values, for sure attarct intersted to more concretely understand how it works, how could develop, how could go beyoing queens and the founding group.how much it is posisbile that co-living communities become a point of reference to each neightboorhood social growth...and then a nertwork of them become soemthing more impactful...single energies are often burn out or depressed by being alone or istitutionalised or politiced....here i see a cognitive breakthru...
ok sounds like a good plan alreadyI just send you an email. My mailadress is ybe@traumatour.eu and skype is chez_filly19 
@Alex Levene and @Aravella Salonikidou (and whoever is interested), let's all make a note to go deeper into the notion of suboptimality. I think it could be important. Normal policy is that fast, messy, large scale response has to be stopped. Citizens are told to stay home, stay out of the way as the professionals dust off their contingency plans. If we can make a case for this to be the wrong thing to do in some case, it is goping to be an important policy contribution. 
So your work/office space is a prison, members of your team are inmates, and it's not a one off because you are setting up a proper organisation to turn this into something sustainable, do I get it right?So many fiction-like cultural references come to mind :-) Really inspiring, and from reallife examples it reminds of the Brazilian Wasteland and how wasted human potential can be turned into art.If you are able to spin this into a social economy / professional re-insertion kind of venture where you make a case about skill training, you might be able to access resources easier than under artistic education or creative industry.. especially if Greece has some subsidies/ funding left for that field. Also, is there anywhere online where the museum works can be seen?
Nice to meet you @meanmicio, I'm nowhere near as knowledgeable about health systems as you, but some people here in the community are and should definitely read this (they may  have already heard about GNU Health): @Ivan Ezeigbo @wachsmuth @markomanka who can maybe help share this with networks.Are you finding that people and established institutions are transitioning to this easily (ideologically speaking) or what do you see is an average learning curve? I'm guessing it's not a coincidence that it's becoming adopted more so in less developed areas than the big West, which are already set on their ways. 
Hey, I wonder if we have met before here and there..? Were you at some point organising the Fest of Solidarity, circa two years ago? anyway..Is your group or another in Greece already using Faircoin, and where? Is anybody estimating how much use is needed in order to see communities or projects up and running and producing results thanks to it?For detailed measurements feel free to point me to resources, I'm sure the story is longer..PS @Simonedb @woodbinehealth make sure you ping @ChristinSa or any edgeryders if you want to be sure they see your comment, notifications can get lost in the long stream.
hello, maybe I can be of help for the chapter 'how to cope with emotional/mental suffering' in your handbook. In fact, I plan coming to greece with my Trauma Tour Bus - providing trauma information and therapy, and also 'help for the helpers' - we need to take care of our own energy and ressources too... Take a look at my website and contact me if you think we can work together.
"So, large mobilization doing suboptimal work is still better than the alternative of not helping or having enough help"this is definitely the case at the Calais camp
@Alberto do you think we can contact someone to learn from the other side, from a facilitator/ community manager involved in a social policy like this, but hear a personal experience nonetheless..? I think it would add nicely to Simone's story.(I'm asking you because I see Simone has a lot of questions addressed below, so no need to load more.. :) 
I think i initially went out to help because i had a sense of purpose. I fesire to use my skills to help people most at need of them.As my time went along though i certainly developed the sense of duty. I definitely saw this in the other long term volunteers i worked alongside.The self care training was mostly around sharing best practice. Asking groups to share ideas around how they unwind, stress reduction, how they notice stress in themselves and others.  
@Rune I think you're right: psychological aspects should be taken into account. Medical diagnosis and treatment are often very 'traumatic' = overwhelmingly disturbing. I don't know if I am the right person to advise Wehandyou - there must be traumaspecialists more familiar with the people affected by these kinds of  trauma and the technology involved. Nevertheless, I am open to collaboration. Lets have a bit of a longer conversation on skype? What do you think?
I suggest a Skype call early next week. Perhaps Tuesday. you can email me alexalevene[at]gmail[.]comI'm no longer at the camp but i can definitely put you in contact with the best people to organise with. I know they would be really greatful if you could go along for a few days. The best use would probably be to spend a day talking to the management team and helping them develop an ongoing practice. Then a couple of days running large group training the daytime and one-to-one sessions in the evening.There are a lot of people there who have a lot of different personal mental health issues. Its probably a better use of your time to focus on this 'secondary' trauma, rather than working with people who have experienced it.Alex
@Alex LeveneI would be happy to be of help for the Calais volunteers. How could we organise it? What do they need? Information about trauma and about helping traumatized people? 'Help with 'secondary' traumatisation (being traumatized by the suffering of others)? An in which way would it be doable - a workshop or a bring-your-questions informal  conversation? Should we provide time for individual help too?How many people are involved?I could come over for a day or two, or tree in october of november, before touring to the south. I am fluent in EN, DE, FR and NL. Would it be a good idea to skype and talk things through? 
.. and well worth the wait. Thank you!Interesting how being a caregiver comes not just from sense of purpose or attachment, but a sense of duty.About the training for self care: what was it like? I imagine that has something to do with how people find it hard to take days off, "switch off" as you say..?  
Thanks so much for sharing your story! Apologies in advance, this is pretty much all questions, I think we can learn a lot from your experience creating this form of housing and the way its changed over the years. I especially relate to and heed your advice about the too many meetings thing ;) . I’m curious to know more about the impetus for starting such a project, if as you say didn’t know each other and had no common identity or belonging, how did you find each other and make the decision together?  Also curious to know how it was initially funded, did you rent or buy a building and grow from there or did you build something new (the image with your post is a co-housing experiment I’m somewhat familiar with, is it related somehow?).In regards “micro-welfare” and mutual support, have you communized your money or is there a separate fund that members pay into for these kinds of things? This is something we’ve been discussing for our group and haven’t figured out quite how to do it with the constraints of an economy like NYC. Have these things created a situation where people are able to work less or not at all? In regards the “gated community” comment and talking about how you interact with the greater neighborhood, I'm curious to know how you’ve navigated this and what your outwardly facing presence is like both in terms of your activity and the neighborhoods perception of your community.  If you work with local government/neighborhood councils, is this something you do out of necessity, as something that sees it as a tool but not a goal or does that participation have value to you in and of itself? I ask because we've gotten involved with local government at times, but we see it as purely strategic, we won't do anything with them that would require some kind of compromise because ultimately we are interested in autonomy from all forms of governance. We think of our outward facing projects as building a territory. In a place like nyc where creating one large place where many people can live together and actually spatially put their lives in common is not really possible, we have formed a network that is concentrated in a neighborhood but spreads across the whole city and connects with like minded hubs in the rest of the country. An important question we ask ourselves is how do we keep this open to all forms of life that would grow our power and we theirs. I would pose the same to your group, how do keep it from becoming an isolated, if enviable situation, which is not merely its own ends?  Would love to know if your model has the intention to put itself forth as a form that could be replicable, maybe it alreay does? If you have ways that you formally share your experiences with other groups so they might learn and begin to try these things for themselves in their particular regions? Would love to know more about any or all of these things. 
my friend, your peoject edvelop in really hard area and time. thanks you are doing it!your peoject has a strong identity. it shows values. You agree with me that not everybody agrees on thos values and practises. it will come a point when (if the project arrive to a relevant size and numbers) you will be in signirficant touch with interests, groups, organizations...that let's say, have a more traditional view.one side is big conflict othe side seam to be the death.third way, try to include what you do with what others do, with the time things and realtionship changes and if it good and betetr, your stile will modify their ones...without conflincts...
i would like to give you a reference of soemthing big which lasted for many decades and had a solid scientific background and support. it is much differnet from your project but in some way it was aimed at showing and trating mind problematic people (sorry for my english) to a different open normal way:a big area (ex psichiatric hospital) transformed into a living community with srvices and cultural events partially manged by people which woudl ahve been reclused.http://www.olinda.org/cittaolinda/paolo-pini google should help in putting into english
my two cents to a great thinker...by profession I deal both with institutions and corporations and, as a citizen, with society and all the issues. each of this world have needs and questions but also resources but, despite rhetoric or good will, they just negotiate on few elements (budgets, regulations..) as counterparts. 2 by 2. if we mange to make the "system" work differently we would easily gain - low costs - a much better impact and effect ..helping the social brain to work in a more complex way, which is not harder.with this open care project we try to do something like that, making several forces co-operate and… if I  can sponsor a bit my part...having housing at the center (also with a good platform) can aggregate actions towards families networks as the center of policies, buildings, peer to peer care, local micro welfare we can enhance a social innovation  
What you say makes complete sense: at the end of the day you have a major crisis and not enough professionals anyway to deal with it. So, large mobilization doing suboptimal work is still better than the alternative of not helping or having enough help.@Franca Locati mentioned something I couldn't forget: she says you can sometimes help someone too much. She was refering to the way organisations work in providing services for newcomers. You two should definitely connect, Franca worked for quite some time in the Italian system of refugee reception, for the City of Milano, and managed to set up a platform for connecting a lot of language teaching organisations around to make a more coherent service to the people needing it.
In my experience (and sociological studies) i reach out to similar conclusions as yours adding some more1. digital helps a lot but not enough as the famous book of sherry turkle descibes (we are together and alone) we need alsoa) training and learning how to take the good out of digitalb) phisical proximity and real realtionshipc) digital can be intersting to share learnings and expereine and communicate with somebody far away, to discover new words...similar and intersting to you (this is not facebook, this is something that includes people willing to share interesting relationship adn prctises)2. so shared spaces in addition to private ones (co-living) can be a solution to some of these issues3. but you also underline that housing is not a standard, that needs are different so "offer" should be personalised by family/groups by size, lifestile and so on. but you cant expect that normal real estate will ever produce anything like that if not stimulated properly...it sounds less profitable... 
... and great video (Nadia showed it to me). I am impressed, and looking forward to get to know you better. (Adding this post to the opencare community group)
Wow, @Aravella Salonikidou , what a story. My favourite part, however, is this:At the moment I'm focus to create a solidarity net that can be prepared for crises. In this network everybody could have a role that can "play" in case of emergency. Also a survival handbook with forgotten or unknown tips and tricks that can solve problems in such crises.In the language we use here in Edgeryders, you are working on a community and documentation for it to operate on common knowledge. There are also opencare's main elements. This is the community equivalent of what venture capitalists call "scaling". You extend your reach, but without large money investment and unwieldy hierarchies. Maybe someone's already asked, but... there is a chance we might help you get funding for your initiative (if that's what you need). We are working on a sort of collective proposal, where the proponent is not just us, but a whole "smart swarm" of grassroots initiatives like yours. More information is here. 
thjey are rebranding, re shaping strategy and muc more things..i deal with them for work purposes...but the chance here is get support of expereinces (good and bad) from families who knows what can mean to live like this without a religous/political/frienship previous shared background.companies or big institutions can probaly leverage on stronge assessts for the real estate side but usually those managers have no idea of what living together can be in this way. external supervisor or facilitators can be one option but sure also they like of direct experience, rural communities or scout or this kind of experience has less chances to be useful to enhance a spread out co-living (and maybe also co-working projects)   
cassa depositi e prestiti operate usually on big projects 8its the finacial side of the government) together with fondazione cariplo. we are a group of family living together...not suc support...
Hi @ybe. It's a long post now so excuseme if I've skimmed too much. As @Alexander Shumsky posted the WeHandU we were talking about the importance of psycological aspects of assistive technology. My experience is that people having sustained a stroke, spinal cord injury or living with MS have a need to talk about it. I's not what you intend by trauma, but I think it could be interesting include your expertice in a 360* service.What do you think?
@Village-Psy it's a good idea but suitable for non stop groups and for those who have the luxury -I should say- to spend time for themselves. Here in Greece we have too much pressure anyway because of economical crisis. Most of the people who helped in my project they used to respond when I was calling for something (help, car, food, clothes etc) and then they were disappearing back to their lives and jobs. Anyway, now we are going to prepare a special place for meetings, so I thing we'll have the chance to care about us better and having fun as you suggest.Thank you!
I'll be back soon!
Hello and welcome @ybe. Thanks for sharing your story.I know for certain that your experience and skills would be really useful to the volunteer organisations working down at the Calais refugee camp.Many volunteers have been working out there for the last year and there is a real need for access to professional mental health care. It will be required even more when the French Authorities start their planned clearance of the camp. At the moment we do not know when this will happen. But the volunteers current support nearly 10000 refugees on the camp and will probably put their lives on the line to help protect the refugees and their things during the eviction. It will certainly be highly emotional and very fraught.
I have known about this project for years (I have even visited!), and really like the way you guys seem to have adjusted and improved your ways of living together. My own co-living experiment is much smaller, and much younger than yours... there is a lot to learn here. I just re-read The Book of Community by @lasindias (also a long-lasting co-living), and found it very rich in insights. Available for free in Spanish and English (can't find the link to the English version at the moment, but I have it). Cassa depositi e prestiti has a very large social-co-housing scheme on the road. We discussed getting involved with them, but they are being quite slow in making a decision. :-)
Hi Orangehouse,This sounds like a fantastic project. Congratualtions on your initiative and making it all work out so well. It's great to hear a positive story where people are learning to integrate and create a new life out of a difficult situation.There are certainly lessons that could be learnt from your experiences. I hope that i can share some of them with the volunteer teams that work in Calais. A project like yours in Calais would be a real start to help allieviate the problems between the local residents and the refugees on the Camp.I'd love to learn more about your process and they way you initially reached out to the refugees. How did you get them to trust you and your service? Have you had any scary moments? Alex
Wow @Simonedb it's been too long! I remember this experiment from back in the days when you shared on the first Edgeryders platform.Alberto was telling me some time ago about a social housing project in Italy (maybe Milano?) where a complex of buildings is rented to poor families, and one of the units in each building is rented to the "community manager" tasked with working on social ties between people. Not sure about details, but it seems it's financed by Casa Depositi e Prestiti. Does your project have anything to do with it or better yet: do you see your project coming to influence social policies in Italy? It seems it's 8 years along the line and you guys seem to have great results to show as to what the future looks like.
Nice work @breathinggame, It's really a good revolution therapy treatment for lungs and chest weakness . I'm sure that is not only those who have chest disease but also those who are in good condition. It's really needs to tell that it's a personal device. Is not necessary to tell that kids are curious and they can bring trouble sometime.Is there any level for  any step of lungs illness?  And is that need any assistance to check the evolution of the patient? 
@Noemi The situation is not so simple as it seems. In Thessaloniki for example there were more than 50 different solidarity groups and thousands of individual people that activated to help the refugees in a way. But it was too much. Thousands of naked and hungry people. No time for planning. It was impossible to organise something that could work seriously. Only the goverment could  make a general call and most of the NGO's worked separately. We 've tried workshops through libraries, marathon brainstorming for mobile apps, mapping groups and needs etc but nothing in a professional way or with cooperation with expertise. At the moment I'm focus to create a solidarity net that can be prepared for crises. In this network everybody could have a role that can "play" in case of emergency. Also a survival handbook with forgotten or unknown tips and tricks that can solve problems in such crises. Especially for clothing, I 'm trying to solve the problem with an idea called "smart boxes" (difficult to explain at the moment). I don' t know if there's something out there that can help. This is why I'm here...

@ybe thank you for your interest! I' d like to know more about your work but there something wrong with the link. Could you repeat it? 
 It sounds like you have been tremendously active  in  the refugee crisis over the past year  and  it is good to hear that although the summer interval has meant that many of the volunteers have disappeared, you are not being discouraged, but rather you are thinking of new ways to keep the venture going.The idea of an inventory of human assets  where everyone can contribute reminds us  of how small communities function best.It sounds like this   year you  found a pool of  competent people with various skills to tackle quick and practical solutions for the vulnerable population you were handling. Now that the refugee crisis is no longer so much in the forefront  fewer people are helping out voluntarily and as you say there is a crisis in the refugee care area. Maybe one thing to consider is that volunteers also need to feel at some point  'taken care of ' ,so providing  the helpers with some sort of 'help' of a different kind than the one they are offering, can be very beneficial in using them longterm. From our experience from village-psy this summer the dynamic that is created in a small community is huge when all  the parties involved feel that they are taken care of. There are many ways to help the helpers. One  that could work could be finding other volunteers to do some art/music or dramatherapy workshops so that  people offering their practical  skills in the venture can get something in return that is challenging, stimulating and in a different way  supportive  to them.  This is just a suggestion, i am sure there will be many more...Good luck with your next steps! 
One reads about NGOs becoming institutions and not in a good way. This is very hard to digest in the real world, since your mission is supposedly to fix a problem. Sorry to hear about that unfortunate experience, we will be on the lookout for other options.
Thx @Andra.B for your suggestion. I am indeed planning to do that in the next few weeks. I'll keep you posted :-)Ps Where are you living, maybe I can come along and meet you?
Hi @KANNABIO, welcome on board! I know hemp production is back and on the rise in Romania too, after prohibitive regulations following the fall of communism. As far as I know it is somewhat subsidized too.Have you attended the OPENandChange workshop in Thessaloniki? With Edgeryders we are trying to gather tens of projects working on community care, broadly understood, to apply for funding. If you're interested to be part of this, we are building partnerships until Sept 20th: http://openandchange.careIf there's anything else we can do to help your initiative, let us know! 
Topio sounds like a very interesting project with a lot of potential. Cities in Greece need to be 'creatively' taken care of' and become more humaine and grassroots activities such as yours targeted to raise awareness in the new generation can pass on crucial messages about what it means to care about the space we live in.We at village psy are also interested in the use of space ,landscape and natural surroundings  and how they can can influence and improve physical, mental and psychological health . Our aim though is the exact opposite in a way, in other words to draw adult urban dwellers , out of city centers and bring them for a few days back to their 'natural surroundings , a village maybe somewhat similar to the one their ancestors came from '.The idea is taking psychotherapy outdoors In locations outside therapists offices and conference rooms where they can benefit from the small community( similar to a city neighborhood) and the natural environment itself.Therapeutic perspectives offered in village psy  ,  such as music therapy, Dramatherapy and Playtherapy  point to the youthfulness that is so crucial in your own work , which, as adults , we tend to loose.Reading about  how you got started ,  the good spirit of synergy in your collaboration  based on trust and respect reminds us a lot of our own philosophy....this we strongly believe is the way forward. Keep up the good work.
thank you for the useful info you gave us about a similar project in Ireland.Concerning our own village psy project, it took place in a small village in central Greece where professionals from the field of psychotherapy,students and people interested in their self development joined together for ten days.During this time -some people joined for  five days, others for the whole period,- in the picturesque village of pinakates,  in its courtyards ,the old primary school, open spaces in nature, participants attended experiential workshops in the mornings and informal lectures in  the evenings.The spaces worked even better than we had envisioned , as they provided true havens for working with such a serious topic as trauma. The combination of the art therapies ,such as music and drama, with more talking, person centered ,existential cures-psychotherapies worked really well as they ended up serving complimentarily.One day , the one dedicated to therapeutic horse riding, participants had the opportunity to actually ride  horses and get in touch with the very special relationship on which this type of therapy is based.Overall, during the ten days ,participants came and went ,yet still managed through the great dynamic that developed and spread , to  form a small but very powerful community which worked in depth, made strong bonds and parted enthusiastic and full of experiences.
Dear @ybe - it's great to hear of your initiative! Following up on Noemi's suggestion - I agree that local organizations/groups/individuals on your trail could also be insightful in identifying groups in need of your services, offer insights on any cultural differences, or support you in a number of other ways (including in overcoming language barriers if existant). I was wondering if you have considered mapping your desired/planned route to facilitate connecting with local groups/individuals before you arrive - maybe a very basic online map? I think it could facilitate reaching out to people on the route and could have potential as a planning tool. 
@noemie, thx for thinking along with me.In my experience (I work in a refugee center in Belgium) there are cultural differences, of course. But aside these differences, we all share humanity and the fact that, in some way or another, we all are familiar with pain, with trauma. Not sharing the same language can be difficult too, but I've helped many people talking in a language that is neither their not my mother language. Also, communication is larger than words: expression, visual support, eye contact and even touch can be means of understanding and helping too. When their is no common language, I work with a translator sometimes too.As for Medecins sans frontières, I applied for a position in the field - but was not accepted. Like many 'traditional' NGO's they have quite rigid and out-of-date conditions of admission - like requiring a master degree in psychology. I have a master in philosophy, 4 years of study in psychotherapy and a specialisation in psychotraumatalogy plus 10 years of experience. Nevertheless I do not meet the 'official' requirements. The recognition of psychotherapy as a valid profession is a complex issue and one that is colonized in Belgium by the medical professions, which is the mean reason why people like me, highly skilled psychotherapists,  are not recognized as such. It is a pity that organisations like MsF follow mainstream politics regarding this issue.
@Omri Kaufmann @Pauline @wishcrys @Andra_Pop and come to think of it even @Andra.B :p might be into this.Say hello to this wandering therapist who is doing traumatherapy on wheels and going on a tour in Europe just now!
After all, choosing to make an investment in a grant application is different from making a sale, and requires different resource allocation and a strech anyhow - so of course choices at each time matter whether or not you are looking to position yourself or not.
Hey Noemi! Thanks for your reply. We don't feel the need to position ourselves so clearly. To the contrary: we would like to cooperate with as many diverse actors as possible. Being anti anything is what we try to avoid. We'd rather build something better together than criticize the old.However, I've noticed that in our field, making choices of who you work with and what you do, positions yourself clearly on a polarized spectrum no matter what. It's not always the case surely, but something that is there nevertheless.Thanks for sharing your experience. You're right; if what we do is in allignment with the values then the results will speak for themselves. This dilemma of choosing may well just be fear of shutting certain doors. Other doors will open and as long as our moral compass works, we'll get to where we want to be :)
Hi there!Thank you for your message.Your work and the Trauma Tour bus concept sound very interesting  indeed.Unfortunately to answer your questions  village psy runs in the summer and specifically in the month of August so that won't be till next year. Also our  invited speakers all join in on a voluntary basis .We wish you the best  of luck with your voluntary work with refugees in Greece and when you do come to our country , do get in touch info@village-psy.gr. It will be nice to meet you in person and exchange experiences .
@ybe I'm happy to meet you, my name is Noemi and while I haven't dealt with the issue at all, maybe this is silly to ask: but I'm wondering if people in different places have own preferences to express themselves, or if language can be an obstacle?Have you tried getting in touch with Médecins Sans Frontières for a collaboration? I was reading about them offering psychological first aid, but apparently there are not nearly enough people on the ground.
@Aravella Salonikidou very interesting to read you, over the past year indeed we in other parts of the world are reading a lot of Greek groups' efforts to respond to the refugee crisis.. all very vocal. I wonder: with so many diverse community efforts, haven't there been any events where active people can do the kind of mapping which you mention, where they can say what is needed from their side and try to collaborate more?I realise it's a lot to expect though, I imagine coping with an unpredictable situation already takes a lot of effort. I remember @Alex Levene writing about the camp in Calais and the fact that coordination happens through medium to long term volunteers. Could they be the kind of primary asset that can help do inventoring, mapping, research for this stage you're at?
Hello Pavlos, thx. Yes I already read their story and and also the one of Aravella Salonikidou, I left a message for both of them and am waiting for their response. Looks like in Greece a lot of people are doing good work :-)    
And look forward to the videos. It seems to me that gamejams and all the events where you are present are most useful for getting support. With anything involving technology the easiest is just to show how it works, so even inviting authorities/ potential funders to gamejams might do the trick. 
Hi @ybe, have you read the story of @Village-Psy and the work they do with education on healing trauma on Mt. Pelion, in Greece?https://edgeryders.eu/en/village-psy-encounters-in-psychotherapy
I can also do 3 and 4 later in the week once more tweets are gathered.The chop and clicktotweet tools are great, you don't know how much I've looked to add Tweet this buttons for past events and didn't find a tool or quick code!The problem with the chat room is that it doesn't seem to collect all tweets, update fast enough and show RTs. Let a few of us use it these days to test it.

The Eur Cultural Foundation has a yearly programme for grassroots initiatives and a call for next year closing on Sep 20. The topic is "Moving Communities". @Tomma I thought you guys might be interested:http://www.culturalfoundation.eu/idea-camp-2017
Yes, I am submitting :-)Fingers crossed !
hello @Village-PsyI am a traumaspecialist (an integrative one, relying on the works of Peter Levine, Bessel van der Kolk, Pat Ogden, e.o). I provide workshops on trauma, supervision and individual traumatherapy in my Trauma Tour Bus. In the winter I want to help in the refugee camps in Greece - since that will be a volunteer job, I am looking for paid work in the region too ... Are there opportunities at your village? Thx for replying @ybe
I think a basic income for everyone would be a good start to an alternative economy. It would tackle the fear of not having enough. Thus, everyone of us could contribute freely to society providing things and services we're good at. For me (traumatherapist on wheels) it would be a perfect solution : be able to work / to give to the world without having to think about 'will I earn enough mony doing so?'In Finland, a basic income experiment is on its way - I am very curious what the outcome will be, and, eventually, how this wil change economy and society! 
I really like the idea of a mixed model. We are now in the middle of a crazy operation to find support for about 150 care-related initatives. Maybe you could be one of them? Info: https://edgeryders.eu/en/openandchange-coordination/your-openandchange-application-process
I got excited reading your piece @Federico Monaco! Your approach to learning and willingness to experiment is exactly what the educational system needs right now. This sums it up quite well for me: "By encouraging sharing of data, more interdisciplinary collaboration, creativity and networking educational institutions could create a new breed of health professionals.". @trythis has some interesting points of inspiration as well...Are there any particular sources of inspiration you use to come up with new ways of teaching? Have your experiments ever backfired?
I'm very intrigued by this idea: "Considering the increasingly ubiquitous 3D technology, many of the medical tools can be soon printed cheaply by anyone. Small ethical pharmaceuticals will be able to produce their own medicine.". It would leave out the parties who suck the most money of out of the local communities. But more interestingly, it would allow for personalized medicine. People with rare diseases or allergies, who are often neglected by corporations based on economical incentives. Empowering these people with the tools to provide for themselves or have a close one provide for them seems like a revolutionary way forward. Then again, safety and legal hurdles quickly come to mind. I hope there's at least room for experimenting with it.1000 people is already a lot... Congratulations! What do you feel is the biggest challenge in order to connect these existing, fragmented initiatives and replace competition in favor of cooperation?
http://tweetchat.com/room/openandchangeIt solves the issue that it's difficult to follow a hashtag while also actively participating in the conversation. With the usual twitter interface you need to have two tabs up and switch between them all the time.Tweetchat is a better interface for doing it:

Really curious to know more about what conclusions you come to doing these experiments. We have a space where we cook weekly dinners for up to 40 people, but we have a relatively full functioning kitchen. We've talked about how we could take our skills of cooking for large groups into situations, such as occupations, blockade/encampments  or the street and do the same with limited equipment most efficently. Have you thought about creating something like a sort of toolkit with your findings about how to best cook in the street, recipes that you have discovered work well with these limitations, etc? Would be really great. Look forward to seeing where this goes.
With this effort of reaching out and connecting groups doing outstanding work at the edge of health/ social care we are doing workshops in several cities in Europe, and one is in Paris on the 25th of September with more open science and tech projects. Will you be joining?@Nadia may know best who else in the community is going to be there. I'm in Brussels the day before and probably won't come, but still very interested.Oh, thanks for the reply. "regulation by design".. this is new to me and I hardly get what it means, so when you have some time do tell.
Hello Alberto,Thank you for your comment.Group therapy is a quite common part of  a therapy programm in clinical setting (psychiatric hospitals). What I like to do though is help individuals and communities to enhance their knowledge about trauma and foster their resilience in the face of trauma. I am convinced that being 'trauma-informed' can help us all cope better with traumatic events in our lives and in the world. We need to talk about trauma and pain more openly. We need to adress trauma and pain more directly, not only in the setting of a psychotherapeutical process.As for the financial aspects of my touring, I would like to be able to work also with people with little or no ressources. So, I plan to combine normal charging with pay-what-you-can fees. I also plan touring and helping in the refugeecamps of the mediterranean area - that part of my tour needs funding. I did not find extra financial support yet ... but I hope I will soon! 
Hello and welcome, @ybe ! This is a suggestive image: a therapist driving her bus into the sunset, looking for traumatized people to help out.I am curious as any previous attempts of dealing with trauma in groups. I know nothing about psychotherapy, but I do recall that this problem was met by army psychologists in wartimes. Too many traumatized soldiers, not enough therapists. Therapy had to be done in groups (and here is where Wilfred Bion's intellectual journey starts) . Has this stabilized into standard practice?As for supporting your activity as a wandering psychotherapist, I guess you are down to two possibilities: charge for your services, and hunt for grants. The first one is by far the better one, for you. Do you foresee any problem in charging patients? Have you run the numbers to figure out how much revenue do you need to generate? 
@Noemi, thank you for your comment. Safety and regulation are very important for us and as a community and a non-for-profit, we plan on setting up partnerships to deal with these issues. I mean regulation will be more the concern of manufacturers and distributors. Luckily we have within the community 3 people expert in regulation issues in medical devices development and we work accodring to the principle of "regulation by design" as well as "safety by design" ;) we first considered regulation and safety and build our development according to the main guidelines. Then i haven't heard about the group about exploring open alternatives in (e)health and healthcare support. Could tell me more ?Finally, thank you for both links, they are very interesting. 
Hey @WinniePoncelet! The fact that you could set up an education program in addition to your biohack space says a lot with respect to how open you keep your initiative. With questioning sources of funding, why do you guys feel the need to position yourselves so clearly? Do you have to choose how much anti something like government you are? Have you had opportunities to work with big biotech and passed? I'm curious because it looks like hacker values are there from ReaGent inception - openness, freedom, passion.. so even if the model changes or mixes government funds with revenues through lab membership or classes you will still be operating under those things. With Edgeryders we had always had some controversy: when we were under the Council of Europe shell it took more work to be credible to activists; when we became independent and taking on also private clients someone would come in and question that; when we go into a room and be too radical someone on the other side will cringe. It's somewhat natural, as long as the work is aligned with our mission and speaks for itself.Or: Is bioengineering these days  so controversial that you need to be firm about what you are willing / not willing to do and who you're doing it for? I would recommend you read a short piece about selling as a moral act by @lasindias and invite @Juanjo Pina who is experienced in activist market production to give a piece of advice. In the past they were asking if the market is the "ultimate alternative to the enclosure of fresh ideas into the dependence of public money or a way for converting activist into established business people"?
Grazie Rune per il complimento ...e per l'incoraggiamento (a non esagerare!)...Entrando nel merito del Tuo post, ritengo anch'io occorra una "localizzazione" più spinta di questa piattaforma dato che purtroppo - almeno in Italia - la lingua inglese costituisce ancora un ostacolo importante e di fatto "disarma" qualunque buona intenzione.Non me ne vogliano i gestori ed i moderatori di questo strumento, ma credo che sia inoltre necessario ripensare in modo più "usabile" questo spazio di comunicazione e di condivisione.Relativamente alla questione del target "utile" per le varie iniziative, come da Te sottolineato, penso occorra pensare a strategie (ancora) locali di informazione, di sensibilizzazione e di coinvolgimento delle innumerevoli entità rappresentative dell'arcipelago delle disabilità che, purtroppo per ragioni storiche, sono realmente poco inclini a collaborare fattivamente con quanti (a torto, naturalmente!) ritenuti concorrenti se non avversari nel complicato sistema della visibilità e del riconoscimento istituzionale che si traduce sistematicamente  in sovvenzioni piuttosto che in vere e proprie convenzioni quasi sempre prive di oggettive valutazioni in tema di costi-benefici e di efficacia-efficienza in un contesto di progettazione e di pianificazione degli interventi e dei servizi.Personalmente, come scritto altrove, ho trovato poca predisposizione da parte di queste a me note organizzazioni a creare sinergie ed a mettersi in gioco in progetti che non si traducano in un immediato "ritorno" istituzionale. Tuttavia permango nell'idea (folle?) che questo approccio possa cambiare in favore di un atteggiamento più lungimirante e pragmatico, in funzione di una maggiore diffusione delle competenze, a vantaggio di una crescente reale rappresentatività  che possa prescindere dalle dinamiche (sfittiche quanto ricattatorie) che attualmente  imbrigliano prevalentemente i portatori dei bisogni con i vari livelli dell'amministrazione della cosa pubblica e del settore economico finanziario.Questo, più di ogni altra cosa, è uno dei "must" fondamentali di OpenCare!
@Noemi thanks for highlighting the project echOPEN. :)  
Hi @concrn @maymay and I will be at the OPENandChange workshop we're organising at the @Woodbinehealth space in Queens on october 2: https://www.facebook.com/events/208119996269998 . Ahead of that the 1 hr crowdconference on twitter later this month is a good opportunity to meet everyone, ask questions, draw in more people. So by the time we are in the room, we're already made some progress etc: https://edgeryders.eu/en/agora/crowdconference-to-tweet-and-share-openandchange-20-sep-at-1700There's already people showing up with UI/UX skills. From a pm: "I was looking over that buoy app ux test video. Have y'all been using it? I'd like to talk to y'all more about visual design for it. I mostly do digital/visual design in the fashion space, but I think my ui/ux could be helpful for this. Have you seen signal? That's friends of ours who developed and designed it; I think they did a really good job of user-accessibility though for a somewhat foreign concept of encryption, and have also been able to make a platform that can scale. Eitherway, we can talk more when you're in town. Hyped to hear more about edgeryders."Also a friend of mine working with infosec will be joining us.
@Maria I thought what these guys are doing might interest you over at SCIMPulse and your planned prototyping events this fall :-)
@Olivier hi, welcome on board. Are you part of the group coming together later this month to explore open alternatives in (e)health and healthcare support?I'm adding here two recent opensource projects that we know of for medical treatment, and which you might enjoy connecting with.Open source game apps as solutions to respiratory diseases!Efforts to open up software eg pacemakers for heart conditions to enable increased security by the logic of: more access -> more resilience and better quality. It would be very appreciated if you could jump in and tell us how you cover the regulatory issues so that your product can actually be used. For example, what part of your code will you certify and does the fact that it's opensource make it more reliable or not for its future uses?
So Happier, an evaluation study on physical actitivity effects on elderly wellbeing, reports significant outcomes in terms of numbers of falls (one less with every 18 months). What would be even more interesting is to see if there are community led projects similar to these which are truly open : they cater to anyone who wants to, providing full open access to all stakeholders delivering or benefitting from the service: I see both Gymsana and Happier cater to a controlled target and study population - in this case people in nursing homes. Ezio Manzini who is a service designer and community member, has written about open networks of care here. I'm linking to it because you wrote that you're interested in new ecosystems and intersections, which is exactly the topic we are exploring too!
Hi @Kipos3, welcome to Edgeryders. I'm a colleague of Natalia and Pavlos whom you probably know already, based in Romania. Thanks for sharing your project, I'm a fan of community gardening ever since I've been to Tbilisi in Georgia and we met a group called Guerilla Gardening (meet @Nick Davitashvili one of their leaders here), who were camped in a public park but also did a lot of school activities to teach kids how to plant. See this video starting from 50':But their relationship with the local authorities is nowhere near as good as yours. You can get some of the hints from their name :) they are trying to get the pedestrian areas secure from cars by setting up planting flowers and trees in second hand tires on the sidewalks. They get fined because officially it's considered littering and throwing garbage around. I understand this is not them acting offensively, but solving problems that authorities won't deal with.Curious: how did Kipos3 turn administration into an ally?
@Kostis Samaras thanks for telling the story. Are you yourself volunteering in this community? I'm curious how does the group mix food provision with spiritual support, and if it is the same people who receive these two different kinds of service. Alternatively, I can imagine people who have accessed new levels of mental wellbeing are in turn more inclined to pay it forward and do humanitarian actions, like in Maria's personal history.Also, have you participated in the OPENandChange workshop? I'm working with Natalia, Pavlos and others here and have been watching what is happening in Thessaloniki from afar, it's been great to see people very active on the ground!
Ok, but what becomes the "being strangers to each other" when it combines with a "feeling unequal to the other"? Being alien to each other? To what extend are the strategies you develop or suggest effective in that case? Did some have (good or bad) experiences for that case? But if one develops specific strategies for that case, one takes the risk to confirm the unequality one wants to overcome or sublimate! The question I raise is relevant, I think, for any type for "feeling unequal". Any hint?Laurent dUrsel
I feel like we could work well together on software dev. We are both open source but perhaps our team and your team could collaborate. We have also developed a compassionate responder training curriculum that may work well for friends who want to be more prepared to respond to eachother in crisis. 
Hi @Noemi and @Alberto. Thanks for your feedbacks. :DIn 2014, we started with the positive expiratory pressure therapy for CF children. It was in fact not the best move as the exercice takes about 30 minutes daily, which would require a lot of resources to have interesting games, plus the fact that the exercice is quite strict, so challenging to make it interesting. We then thought about other, more free gameplays, which we have to develop. We are now working on mini-games for asthma, that are about triggers and how to take the medicine. We want to reuse the work done for CF to build short games for aerosoltherapy.Regarding tests, we did a prestudy with ten children in a hospital, to see their interest, and that was positive. We are preparing two studies with focus groups to test the games that have been improved.Many learnings were also about setting the collaboratife framework, platform, etc. We are writing a few articles about that, that should be released in the next month. The initiative mostly advances during events as our community is always small, but we start to have funding and are going to redistribute them, with the aim to mobilize contributors on the long run. One big challenge is also that our non-exclusive model is not easily understood by authorities, so it takes a lot of time to explain it, and many fundings are not available as most competitions support profit-driven organizations. So we are thinking about creating a specific structure to be able to access these resources. Another thing is to move from proprietary to free softwares, for example from Google docs to a wiki, or from Unity game engine to another one. So they are lots of interesing challenges at different levels. :)We invite you to subscribe to our YouTube, where we are going to release 15 interviews of what participants learned during the last gamejam. In the next months, we intend to do gamejams in Montreal, Geneva, and possibly Paris and Lima if you d'like to join there or remotely!
Would you be up for articulating the question and posting it in a status update on the event page? This would help get the ball rolling. Maybe like to this thread? I'm looking into the accomodation solutions btw. At this end we are actiely working towards settingup a phycial edgeryders space, some kind of coliving and working that would allow us to host people for extended periods of time as they work on their initiatives . i.e. time free from the tyranny of having to pay rent to just get on with the work that needs doing. It's something I would like to bring up at the workshop too- models for doing that sustainable and with very little money.
Congrats @breathinggames ! I also would like to know about the testing. opencare is about honest sharing of knowledge, including things that don't quite work as expected. In fact, failures (especially non-lethal) tend to be more interesting datapoints than successes, because we can learn more from them. :-)
Agree with most everything @Natalia Skoczylas and @Noemi are saying. The only difference is that I do appreciate that Uber/Airbnb create some value for local communities, by giving some extra freedom to people on the ground. For example, say you notice that there is a long queue for taxis at your local airport on Friday nights. You can then in principle step in as an Uber driver and make yourself availabe for that time slot, if you need the money more than the time. It is a market clearing mechanism, but a clearing market is, in itself, a good thing. What's bad is a market underpinned by asymmetric power relationships. But we have that anyway: taxi drivers telling people "you can't work here, this is our turf" is an act of violence. It is no coincidence that most Uber drivers in Brussels are Arabs: plenty of unemployed/underemployed young Arabs in town, and Uber lowers the threshold for them to enter the business. Without it, driving for money is off limits for them. But you have all heard this before, many times. 
Hi @breathinggames, whoa you rock. How did the prototype testing go, I imagine this is the kind of practical solution that literally everyone loves? PS Congrats for the large numbers of partners you managed to bring on board (I counted 18 on your website!)
@Alberto, we should keep your line in mind and mull over it: not scaling as a solution to survivability!@Natalia Skoczylas my position is similar to yours: I cant argue in favor of "vulnerable" big companies as long as they do not give back to the community when they can afford to. Ok, they started by differentiation in their business model in that they are not a taxi company, they are a car sharing service. But de facto they operate in the same market except not playing by the same rules as everyone, and taking a route in which they dont make a claim on new and better rules. Or maybe I'm missing that claim. To me, the difference between future clinics such as @steelweaver 's or Helliniko-turned-big and services like UBER is that the former reshape markets to make it better for an overwhealming majority, while the latter just want to stay outside markets for a bigger margin. Yes, they made a contribution in their disruption - I see how bigger the service quality is on the local taxi market where I live and where UBER just arrived, but that's not enough when they can potentially take more from the community than what they give.
@Rune, I took the liberty of converting this challenge response into a wiki as I keep coming back to this whenever I (re)read other stories. Making a quick note for now:There are many points already being made in OpenCare about circumventing existing system regulations. Aside those you link to there is: Stepping outside the commercial model in a donation based informal acupuncture clinic, by @steelweaver.Helliniko clinic without legal or taxable status - which is one of the reasons why they are not accepting donations in money. 
@Nadia at one point was proposing to look into a community-run certification scheme for the code in medical devices, vaguely inspired from http://www.peertopatent.org/ . It could be one of the projects in OpenAndChange! 
Probably the easiest is to find a human carrier, you never know with medicine across borders.
First off, let me apologise for the long delay. I have been truly buried in work, and my life got heavily disrupted by personal matters for a couple months.@RuneI think we have some miscommunication here. I'm not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has 'similar' issues to the issues of open source.On your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by  P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don't believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper "Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.There are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA's limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFMBy making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request. I'm not here to inflate the claims, and honestly I prefer to let Marie do the talking about these subject because her patient viewpoint is balanced and essential. However, I'm happy to provide more reading and evidence, when time permits.
That's an interesting development! Thanks for sharing.I'm actually trying to send some medicines to a friend in Serbia at the moment, because he got the meds prescribed for Lyme but cannot buy them over there. It really doesn't make any sense at all.
Thanks for sharing @Michel and @Costantino!To follow @Alberto and @Noemi, I'd like to invite you to discover our initiative, which builds a common on respiratory health including free/libre and open-source games and flowmeter. Also on Edgeryders. :D
Hi @focseattle, welcome to Edgeryders! How did you hear about us, I wonder? I think you're the first community initiative I've heard about in that area of the US..  so lovely to meet you. I'm not a mother (yet) but I can imagine the comfort in a period which can be very depressing for women for reasons that are not simple to grasp by mothers themselves, let alone by the community without a support structure.I see the cafe was crowdfunded. Is it working now after two years? I wonder if you've managed to grow your support base to not just families of color, but to others who are keen on hanging out in a more culturally aware environment.. And also: is your 
@Rune sorry for the delay in responding. Not taken negatively at all. It would be natural to analyse the risk factors involved.From what I read it cost the students €70 to build from “their” resources. The students developed the wheelchair design for users in developing countries using whatever materials are most readily available in each region.  The idea is that people close to the end user should be able to build, assemble and disassemble it themselves. DIY Wheelchair can be built with the most affordable materials in each country: PVC pipes, bamboo etc. This is a solution that is always be tried and tested, back in 1993 and many others. They’re aim was to develop an affordable solution to improve the lives of people. aims to promote inclusion and improve the mobility of disabled people with limited resources from developing countries, where only a minority of those in need of wheelchairs has access to them.The DIY Wheelchair isn’t a product, but a toolkit with assembly instructions that can be downloaded and a video demonstration which lends the user to use their own resources in the region to  assemble the chair. It’s a start.However, there are challenges of an affordable design. This type of open design has some drawbacks, since it lets users alone. Without a support network including designers, for the ergonomics to be satisfied and, users could use badly the instructions or not use them at all. More work to done in this respect. 
Hi Noemi,We lead by example as well as train the community members to become responders. Feel free to call with more questions! I'd love to chat 415-881-8278 Jacob
Hello Laurent, of course you are welcome, you can always bring somebody else from your team with you, i just need to know how much people will come so i prepare the accomodation as good as possible. 
Sei un grande poeta @francesco Maria ZAVA e i tui posts meritano un traduzione multilingua.As I have been virtually living in OpenCare spaces for some time I find myself absorbed and transformed into a social network junkie, searching for something, being inspired, learning, trying to add value. Many things to say….so i’ll just get to the point...and to do so I need some labels (‘etichetta’).  I am in the group of ‘suppliers’ who are supposedly helping ‘consumers’ My impression is that this network tissue is made of 99% ‘suppliers’ leaving the ‘Fuffa’ sterile. Although ‘fuffa’ tends mysteriously to grow by it self I believe we seriously need to involve some fertilizers and seeds. Worth saying: where are the ‘consumers’ ? How can we involve the users (handicapped, diabetics, etc)? And I intend direct, firsthand involvement here like this https://edgeryders.eu/ka/node/6503. My idea is a pledge for everybody to try to invite the ‘consumers’ to comment.We need a better landing page than opencare.cc (but I have no idea). In local languages. A way of triage connecting people with common issues as I have already pointed out elsewhere.  As OpenCare is pretty scattered we need some labels (like it or not) What do you guys @op3ncare, @Costantino,@Nadia, @Alberto, @Federico Monaco think? I am on my box againg because I have been sharing the link opencare.cc and https://edgeryders.eu/en/op3ncare/home. Either people finds it too intimidating (like i did) or they don’t care. I’d like to know Note: Fuffa is the unesthetic little wad of wool that forms on wool clothes or hot air 
Hi @Pavlos, thanks for reporting.Did you think people could connect their stories with dimensions of care? For example, in the Improve and Complement sections, were there projects in the room already contributing to some of those areas? I'm thinking of the many "civic led project leveraging volunteering".I can imagine, for example that "Schools supporting cooperativism" is mapped well by @Tópio activities. So some areas could be better covered than others. Should we rely on the stories posted here to make those kind of connections? 
Hi @Laurent dUrsel nice to meet you, I'm one of Yannick's and Nadia's colleagues, coming to Brussels for the workshop.Indeed, the dates have changed so this workshop is the only one, and I'm sure you are welcome to join anyway. Looking forward to meet you!
I see people in today's fairly young generations building professional paths along these lines. One of the latest political party in Romania running for national elections is a formerly local political party founded by civic activists. Now they're going national, after the founder has seen 25% support in the local elections. However it looks like titanic work, their lack of experience shows many times, and funding missing. The road is uncertain, but attests to the idea above. Also, my story of a grassroots innovation in the medical system which a few years later contributed to the founder being appointed Minister of Health also makes the case. 
Moshimoshi folks,I think the work you are doing is great. I am an anthropologist who studies young people's practices on the internet, and one of the projects I am working on wants to understand how users on Tumblr use the space for solidarity and resistance, to share resources both good (i.e. recovery) and bad (i.e. relapse, hiding evidence of self-harm).It strikes me that the language of "shit happens" is not only gendered and culturally-specific, but also speaks to a segment of young people who are able to articulate their hardship and agony through humour - unforunately, this may not be a language accessible or comfortable for all.It would be great to see how your team will approach different internet/social media platforms and uncover the different cultural norms each one has with regards to expressing thoughts about mental health (i.e. nice images but cyptic captions on Instagram? secret groups on Facebook but not public status updates? anonymous Tumblrs with all-out honest confessions?) Looking forward to reading more on this. Good luck!
Dear allI spoke about this project also with other collegues that work in Fondazione Don Gnocchi (english presentation). Maybe someone can contribute to this project.
@Noemi, My two cents about your questions. The ethical suffering can occur in any organization where it is required to do things that are too far from what actual work should look like in the eyes of the concerned people who are passionated about what they do.I've observed such situations in not for profit AND in for profit organizations even though the purpose and the values behind the organization were sensefull for people. It is about the meaning of the work to be done and the way it is asked.Indeed distributed decision making processes (cf the integrative decision making process), spaces where people can share practices in order to improve them (which supposes that they have an influence on them), the autonomy of each team and individual in his/her area of competence and responsibility (where each person is sometimes leader and sometimes follower) combined with a results-oriented work process (instead of an effort-oriented culture giving more credit on hours spent then on results) are cornerstones to move forward in the right direction.What is meant by heath at work ? Do we speak about fitness, yoga and mindfulness ? If so, it is just an approach to relieve people and allow them to go on in an unsatisfactory environment. If it comes on top of the characteristics I mentioned hereabove, it will be the ice on the cake.Last but not least, working for a purpose-led organization that strives for a better world will surely help at the condition that the way this organization works is consistent with its aspiration.
@Philippe Drouillon welcome back! This ethical suffering idea of yours reads really interesting, I can see your point and will try to add something to it.By new ways of giving back the floor to doers, do you mean new decision making models? Or more tolerance for the doers in an organisation run in traditional way, a way of compromising? Our community conversations so far mention burnout in entirely new kinds of organisations growing from bottom up movements. You'd say these new orgs could be better candidates for diminishing that tension and ethical conflict. I myself am an exhibit of that. But you also see people like @marcoclausen reporting cases of community activists lost in simply too many requirements which they hadn't signed up for.  They come with the "job description" so to speak, especially in a non-sustainable environment where you have to compensate for roles you can't afford to pay for. So you have cases of burnout because of simple overwork, even with passsion and alignment between what is required and what you want to do.Curious, from your experience of working with both co-ops and more traditional businesses: is sustainability of an organisation correlated with healthiness of work? Here I mean the quality of what it produces, its impact. Maybe if there were some roadmaps or a system of sustainability rewards that come with keeping healthy at work, at the expense of some other things, we'd get better at moving our work forward.
Hey, this village reads like a novel approach to mental wellbeing and its openness in the sense of free choice - "in 8 days can experience nine different approaches in order to arrive at what is the most compatible with their own interests". I  am wondering what exactly people do during the session - is dramatherapy happening or other sorts of activities? I'm reading on your English language website that you also did music therapy, playtherapy, therapeutic horseriding..? Did those work out the way you envisioned?Ping @Alex Levene for his interest in healthcare + arts, and @Thom Stewart because he runs a similar pilot experiment in Ireland - opening up practices in psychoterapy to new elements, mostly community based.
@Alberto Are you ok to give the 1:2h talk presenting the project challenge and expected impact, and activites going on?@CostantinoDo you still plan to participate?Challenges: have a look on the Hacking Health Bordeaux website.Does WeMake still plans to submit a challenge? UBx will submit one around designing UI to navigate discussion forums, find the most relevant people w.r.t. to some topics, etc. @Alberto: would you like to join this challenge? We will probably provide (anonymized) data extracted from the opencare platform.
Nice to meet you Vivian at @Tópio, and thanks for showing these beautiful pictures! I suggest we show them when giving your project a shout in the network.You mention various educational tools for “placemaking”. Do all your activities in the project involve public art of some sorts? Or do the kids learn other ways of engaging with the landscape?  
This looks like one of those really simple things that improves the world.  Astonishing little things.Like this one: "ERADICATING POLIO FROM THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH". I'll donate now, everybody please do the same now.After UNICEF has ended polio, could they be using your project?
Hi Alberto!The two main reasons are the following:- many (not to say most of the) players join consortia to submit proposals for EU funding, looking just for either cash, or for a way to complete "deliverables" with the minimum effort required. This attitude does not deliver actual usable results- Most researchers are not "market-savvy". Most of the times they think that, since a technology exists, the problem is solved. But nothing is farther than the truth! Turning a technology into a product that solves a problem,and creating a supporting community is an exciting but difficult venture!   That's the gap we found...
So this is a cheap herbal remedy. It grows really well in these tropical regions, and quite fast too. So it does not take up a lot of cost in production, except for its processing which could cost quite a bit. But this advantage allows us to produce en masse and a cost efficient rate, so we are able to give it out to the public at incredibly cheap prices - cheap enough to have daily supplies affordable by just anyone. Since these are teas in tea bags, it makes it even better.
Hopefully! :) It's an interesting area to look into.
Hello,I also joined the discussion. Will try to describe how we started and what we are doing a bit more in details and will send it to you as soon as possible. Like the community here. Will check and read about the projects and share them with the world :)
Nice input from Ginette and valid points.Last week I had several conversations with philosophy friends of mine who noted the same in their research or otherwise. They made some interesting points. I tried to reconstruct them, but there might be some holes in it.Most 'activism' today is done by do-ers. Bottom-up initiatives that took it upon themselves to solve problems that governments should take care of. They noted that this shift to just getting your hands dirty and not wait for government action is actually quite a neo-liberal way of solving problems.The ideal of May '68 has become ingrained in the way the mainstream thinks. The loss of faith in government and institutions has become part of a normal way of thinking. Management and corporations have adopted it in a way: they want to get rid of the old and slow processes, they want radical disruption asap and would like as few interventions by government as possible. Government is mainly seen as an obstacle at this point.Bottom-up initiatives follow the same reasoning to a large extent. Government is one of the obstacles to be overcome, because they're perceived as ingerently part of the problem, almost an external factor that is unchangeable. But they have to do it with less means, less people and less power (leading to the burnout problem). Additionally, the whole neo-liberal side will see these projects and initiators as 'one of them', because of the shared 'entrepreneurial activism'. For an outsider, the difference between both fades.One of their conclusions was that there is a need for political activism by these bottom-up activists right now, rather than only acting boots on the ground. Otherwise real systemic change may not follow, as politics today is mainly politics for the sake of politics, heavily influenced by big economy.What do you think about this?
Hello Ivan, what a great research project you have going on! If you can push the research further and pour it into some kind of organisation for distribution, I bet it would have a large impact.How do you think you could make the tea reach the people who need it most but can't afford it, and avoid it only reaching the happy few (like the often prosperous superfood buyers as Noemi mentioned) who don't really need it but can afford it?
I mean Nadia El-Immam, of course. And I think, dear Alberto, that a kind of SHWASHLOCK-DoucheFLUX partenership would be welcome... in the future. Because right now we are mainly running to get the 400.000 € missing to finsih the renovation of the future DoucheFLUX building. But, yes, the words of Donald Paschal you quoted are very inspiring. Thanks ! Laurent
dear Yannick, sorry for this late answer : you were my very first message on this plateform... Thank you for the invitation, it would be a pleasure for me, of course, to join, but a nephew has the terrible idea to get married this 24th of September, so I'm afraid I'll have to leave around 1 PM. Is it still possible ? And does this mean that the 24th of September replaces the 10-11 September worshop, Nadia spoke me about ? Yours Laurent
Thanks for the vote of confidence, @Vassilis Giannakopoulos - SciFY  . And thanks also for this great experience.I was trained as an economist, and I find it easiest to think about what you do in terms of fixing a market failure. In a perfectly functioning market, the stuff that is only a few months away from being productive would be immediately picked up by somebody who spots an opportunity for gain. What do you think causes the market failure? Why is it that you can look at a paper and see the opportunity, while others cannot? 
Hi @concrn, welcome! I'm Noemi, and my own cases of irrelevant (at best) or aggravating (at worst) situations appearing in connection to system brutality are listed here.I like your solution - training communities to compassionately respond to their own crises before police get involved.  How do you do it? Is it through your own example or do you have activities to teach citizens that?In Bucharest there is a long time organisation working with drug addicts and sex workers on the streets, and they are so hung up in the very basic aid of providing IDs for these people or getting them into the social security state service provision, that they can't really do anything else, that's how hands on and exhausting that task is. And while they could need help, it's very time consuming to train others how to deal with people on this dramatic edge - because of the emotional investment and very specific set of skills needed.They do, however find new ways of helping those in need, but incipient - car wash social businesses, or a social restaurant providing some jobs. Anyway, titanic work!
We (+Costantino, +Alexander Shumsky) are working very hard on parallel activities.A. We are about to establish the first prototype session (prototyping the flow of encounters in WeHandU). A1. We are contacting candidate participants (people with tetraplegia/multiple sclerosis or stroke).B. Grant applications (we already got swedish, local and other funding + materials) - preparing 100k request ;-)C. Finishing instructables for solution for the hand. D Launching the  WeHandU.IT siteAny participation would be great fun (as in functional) for all. Especially on public relations (A1) management (B) and networking (D)  
Tanks +Francesco Maria ZAVA. What happened when you ' had tried to involve the LEDHA'? I had a look on the site.  I't really would be a great help I you, or someone (+Costantino, +Alexander Shumsky) could inquire.
I learned something new today, and it didn't take many clicks on the Internet to see that moringa is being called a superfood. Hopefully you'll break new ground with herbal remedies as affordable treatment, and not just in Africa!
They all seem to speak english.Sometimes we have beginners, but we have other refugees around who help out....at least when it comes to teaching and IT skills.Sadly, in germany many people do not speak english well and feel very uncomfortable when speaking it, so they rather dont speak it andsend everyone who doesnt speak good german home.We hope teaching digital skills will help them find remote jobs or real jobs abroad.
HiSome time ago, just before the OpenCare Project's start, I had tried to involve the LEDHA (http://www.ledha.it/) that, as reference body for the associations of disabled people, could then and could today contribute to the construction of competent connections as parties concerned for the development of "WeHandU". I believe that the proposal to Rune can actively engage these people.Of course I agree on the role of WeMake as a reference point and work space! : D
I am hoping one of you can help connect Rune and his team to practitioners and patients interested to volunteer to explore how assistive technology can move forward and into use? @Rossana_Torri, @Franca, @Francesco Maria ZAVA, @Alberto Simonetti ?

Maybe can this interesting too?http://www.ipp.eu/en/topics/health-and-well-being/siel-bleu-project-fonds-danone-pour-lecosysteme/http://www.ipp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/n16-notesIPP-january2015.pdf
In my opinion te cases against Uber and Airbnb are valid even if I love the ideas behind them. Uber is getting sued for not providing their drivers with essential support: health care, insurance, repair costs while being free to bring down the prices. And as Google is joining the race, prices will go down. Another problem with Uber is its hunger for monopolizing the markets around - which hopefully will be stopped as well, although this will happen most likely thanks to other giants. About Airbnb, you are entitled to rent a spare room where you live - the case is against fake sharing, de facto homes and apartments that were emptied so the owners would make money on short term rentals. This changes the landscape of the city and has huge, negative effects. probably the difference between scaling and monopolizing markets is one of the criteria here. These startups lost the reasonable idea of scale and infringed territories. Hotels and taxi corporation will protect their share and lobby against these companies, which doesn't need to be good in results. But these battles amplified processes in the urban spaces which could have been happening more quietly before, and that's good. And made people think about sharing and new ways of the economy. Built trust. I think the key here is not to let one giant to emerge, but to allow organic replicas to provide similar offers in their environments, without overarching the whole globe with a great huge fix. If the efforts remain decentralized, scattered, but also adapted to local needs and problems, I can't see a way in which this model would be bad (of course. pharmaceutical companies and other parties interested in ridiculing anything's that out of the system will try to fight it and there will be a need of great success stories that can be told to the people in order to change their attitudes towards alternative approaches to care. Maybe it's not even too late, herbal medicine didn't completely disappear...) or harmful. I believe there should be manuals and ways to ensure people providing help are capable of doing it, however, what kind of manuals and to what extent, I have yet no idea. 
Yes, you're right. Although some of my dermatologists I've seen plenty of times over years - they just kept on trying things on me, instead of looking for some other reasons why their treatment didn't work (probably they didn't address the issue at its core). Anyhow, then I have learned an interesting thing about prescribing people tests. It turns out in Poland each doctor is given a number of tests he can prescribe to people: blood, sugar, more sophisticated ones. BUT, if the doesn't spend them all, he gets PAID for each test he didn't give out. Anyway, it's just one of the pathologies of the system I've discovered - as my family is full of doctors, every time I open the discussion I am more and more stunned by how badly it was designed. I am not enough of a sample I am afraid - I could only bring a couple of stories:)
Hi Noemi,Maybe is this publication after the Get Physical programm part of the answer to your question: http://ec.europa.eu/sport/policy/preparatory-actions/documents/045-0565-siel_en.pdfIt was the last programm I followed during my periode at Gymsana. We were preparing a new programm at the end. Innoviris has launched a call to action and we introduced a project that names Meet Move. I can ask more info to my old colleges
I would be interested to see if some interventions can trigger more emphatetic treatments and how that affects patient wellbeing. Things like "Hello my name is..." campaign for practitioners to be more humane, or the other day I was reading about inserting empathy in the medical studies - "What Medical Residents Learn from Art Museums".  These things don't feel too sophisticated things to do for apparently very high returns. We all seem to agree that "more empathetic" is better for patients wellbeing, not just satisfaction which is more obvious. 
Nice to meet you @serapath, and what a good match with Franca. She was saying elsewhere, in her own words, that language is key to connect newcomers to the new setting, but also arguing for activities like the ones you propose. Do you manage to break throguh the language barrier, or have people helping with that? Either way, well done, it seems there's a lot you have going on and quite some activity (checked your live chat, great one hehe).
... and great discussion. Something to think about for the second year of OpenCare. A collaborative map of waiting vs. being given health care and empathy? Nice artifact.The idea of "rules instead of Hippocratic oath => bad" is intuitively very appealing. I think @teirdes has some structured thoughs and experience. 
@Natalia Skoczylas, as of the hypothesis of 30% errors in my comment, I understand (and know) the 'try it out' stuff. I'ts ok I think. The problem is that as it is extremely valuable information gets lost. Consider two cases:A: It worked            B: It did'nt work.Was it due to chance or attributed to treatment?If everybody reported the result systematically it would be easy to identify best treatment. Unfortunately this info gets lost and nobody learns. This leaves it to the bias of where money gets invested for clinical trials. Another reason for a  review system.   
Hmm, @Natalia Skoczylas, I'm impressed about your international experience. It could be extremely interesting analyzing those 8 countries, comparing them with other peoples experiences (I've only lived in DK,UK,NL & IT). With the free movement of labour and free choice of public health provider (HCP) it could be interesting to have a sort of 'google maps' scoring system of satisfaction. People could score the on a couple of dimensions ....is that networking stuff @Alberto?
Thanks, @Alberto. You coined it perfectly ' This is about patients being researchers, and viceversa'. Actually we try to avoid terms like patients (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/patient) but prefer participants, mentors and facilitators differentiating the role of engagement.
Thanks @Natalia, re 'volunteer their time to work on their research'  I'd like to point out that we do not consider it research, rather a quest. The research has been done, it's about applying the results and create value for the comunity.
@Noemi, Thank you for clarifying that! I would appreciate that list, so I could reach out directly. 
@Rune, I've lived in 8 countries in the past few years, mostly in Europe. I've been to doctors in all of them. And there were no computers to assist the doctors, mostly they had a person to do the written documentation. Which didn't change the fact that even if they had theoretically more time to spend on approaching me as a patient, they would mostly limit their help to examination and writing a prescription. Rarely they bother talking to me and try to figure out the reasons for the problem. It happened a lot with dermatologists, who basically just give you a prescription for some external treatment, very expensive, and ask you to try it out. None of their recommendations ever helped me. Last times were absurd to an extent that the doctor wouldn't even tell me what he thinks is wrong until I asked - and then the questions about medication followed, with an ironic response: oh, so you're interested in drugs? I don't know what these doctors are actually frustrated with. I guess an inhumane amount of patients to see every day might be one of the reasons. Still, I would suggest there is a huge lack of empathy training during their studies and work, and maybe this is why they're incapable of approaching their patients in a more personal, compassionate manner. 
thx.We currently have around a half a dozen refugees involved in our e-learning program that actually learn and some more in the community, but we are pre-launch.The refugeeswork.com platform has already ~400 refugees signed up and regular activity.Refugees dont need any skills to start. we start with "whats a browser" and "how to create an email account" and progress to how to build your own web app over the course of ~120 videos for now. More will follow soon to diversify what can be learned.The main results are refugees who started to build their portfolio pages and now know some programming and design. Other results include refugees who managed to get in contact with locals for paid gigs and/or voluntary activities to get to know locals.
@Noemi, @Alberto - I had a short conversation with @Rune and @Alexander Shumsky yesterday. Besides discussing OPENandchange, I was also asked to try and help to find physiotherapists and patients who'd like to volunteer their time to work on their research. Do you know of anyone in the community who could be of help here? Or a good way to connect? They really want to have people from Milano and around, in order to be able to work hands on and regularly with them. Let me know if you have a good idea;)
Kudos @Woodbinehealth and @maymay .
Hey @Rune sorry for the slow response, somehow I had managed to miss this. So Amir mentioned two things which may be helpful.  You reminded me I have to post the notes from the conversation withwith him. Doing it now!! will post a link to it here later today.
@Maria yes! The challenge itself is around mental wellbeing, and people (like Pauline above) write about connections they find interesting or helpful projects.
Thanks for the answer, @Woodbinehealth . :) Your answer helped me understand the position of Woodbine within its context. I think building relationships with existing institutions can be a double-edged sword. It can be valuable, but it can also be a trap (a sinkhole of money, time, energy, etc.). I hope there is still room for discussing how to meet basic needs "outside" of the system, or at least—as there seems to be—a willingness to explore how to support doing that from the perspective of additional care-giving such as you're already doing. Anyway, thanks for clarifying.
@maymay, you bring up a great point.  One aspect of what we're trying to do is balance the desire for a new world with the recognition of the reality of the world we live in.  That we can strive for prevention, but we must address the material reality of how people live.  The battle to live paycheck to paycheck is very real here in the city, especially for us as a collective.  But many of us are sheltered from things like homelessness and hunger in a more acute way because of our social privilege, education, social status, etc.  Not to say that members haven't experienced that, but on the whole, we are somewhat privileged.  We struggle with the more care driven models of soup kitchens, shelters, NGO-type aid groups because 1) we don't have the infrastructure to develop such aid and 2) we don't want to create another area of dependency, where the NGO model fills a hole in a society.  So likely, we will have to create relationships with such institutions who can and are doing that good work, but that we will continue to straddle the line of revolution.  For example, I work at one of the public hospitals in the city and regularly help people navigate that system.  But at the end of the day, we don't believe these systems have the answer we are looking for, similar to what @Alberto was talking about in regards to the Amish.  Thanks again for the great discussion.  And @markomanko, agree that we have to study the idea of both being within the system and out.  Here in the US, the professionalization of many specialities places it in a realm outside of normal access, ie through insurance companies, inhumane public institutions, high priced private centers.  An on-going struggle fer sure!
@Nadia @maymay, Thanks for all the pings and sorry for the delay.  This seems like an amazing tool.  I think it could be helpful for us to create a larger community of resources.  I'll message you all privately to learn more about how we could apply it to the situation here.  And also to plan a potential visit/event!  
Hi, @trythis, I did some research when my children were small. There are a number of patents (probably run out now) having excellent solutions. I think the solution is probably a two piece combination: 1 controlling unit2 disposable/washable sensorAt the time I considered a simple humidity sensor (measuring the impedance in the diaper, but its only effective for urine. What is the current state of gas detectors? A small one that could detect some compound in feces? 
The issue was another: Waste of resources due to untimely change and lack of timely changeNone have to do with the type of Diaper ;-) 
I'm very interested in what you're describing. I know a couple of people in the med field, but have a different background (materials) myself. Usually I can also bring something to the table though.Off the cuff a couple of pointers that you might find interesting:- Medical experience / learning in war and peace are somewhat different (perhaps you can borrow approaches as is convenient)- Over time (and hierarchy levels) there is also quite a shift in approach to matters (look up e.g. Florence Nightingale or Ignaz Semmelweis)- I think there is a lot in the medical field which is extremely bad to codify in(to) written language but can be learned face to face. I would think a "social network of people who went through your problems" would be useful particularly in regard to doctor-patient info responsibilities (the doctor is pressed for time and may not be able to relate to a patients situation as well as a "veteran" from the network).
I can't really answer your question "Is there some documentation that opensource software is more reliable compared to proprietary code with a relevant approvals?" as I am not aware of applicable metrics that do this with little/no room for interpretation. It would be interesting what @Eireann Leverett can provide in those terms.As for " Honestly, would you dare to hack a pacemaker or implant one that was running opensouce version 42-beta last edited by someone with an obfuscated name ?": Well who decides that Windows Millenium or Windows 8 is not beta anymore, and what are the programmer's names? Not sure, but couldn't you beta-test in a dummy, an animal, or even a human (in a less sensitive location) before you declare it a finished product?Of course I agree that such probing questions need to be asked, and you can't expect to automagically transport some (but not other) features of one field into another field with a very different history etc. and expect to be able to predict the outcome.However, regulations have a tendency of accumulating and not always for the right reasons, so critical questions from outsiders are in place, particularly in the medical field I would say. Also there is the issue of possibly not being able to support the current complexity of the domain in the longer term.Lastly, I think work in the techno-medical-regulatory domain may help overcome indifference towards the consequences of technological choices, as illustrated in Alberto's comment.
Hi @Tomma I wrote you a PM. If there still is something I can perhaps help with give me a ping. Regarding tools there are certain methods that use almost 0 tools but can still get a lot done. https://cocreate.localmotors.com/nowbreakit/epoxy-minimal-mess-small-footprint-approach/Epoxy is not cheap (unless it is a day over shelf life - ask around at boat builders or wind power manufacturers, perhaps in Rostock) but it can get a lot of stuff done. If you put some glass fiber (ask the same people for scraps) on the cardboard honeycomb it becomes very strong (but only moderately so in compression).You should not work where people live, and have good ventilation (wear glasses, gloves, read the fine print), but composites experience is very marketable, especially if you can work clean and precise.Is there magnetic stuff around (bed frames, parts of walls)? If yes you can buy a big batch of magnets (the strong ones are neodym) and use them to fix wall paper, fabric or similar. They can be pretty small and cheap and still get a lot done, also for improvised electronics.Do people use batteries a lot? Perhaps you can switch to rechargeable - with some help from Panasonic? You can build powerpacks for mobile electronics. A very basic kit will let you do a Repair Cafe and bring in more tools and parts (talk to Ifixit.com). A small amount of epoxy will also come in very handy there.
One main finding made by field researchers about burn out is that one of the main factors that leads people to burn out is "ethical suffering" (litteral translation of the original expression in French "souffrance éthique") and this before workload.What does that mean ? Stress often comes from a conflict of values between prescribed work and "real" work, "real" in the sense of what really has to be done in a correct way.A large amount of professionals who get burnt out couldn't live anymore with the contradiction between what is asked and what should really be done. And I don't speak about ethics from ideological point of view. Just the tension between what is asked and what true professionals believe should be done (eg : social workers in big institutions, engineers in industrial companies, nurses in hospitals,...). The fact that there is no place anymore for true dialogue, exchanges and co-construction around their own practices worsened the situation.So bringing "real' work in the center of the operations by giving back the floor to those who act is a way that is currently implemented in a few organizations to significantly reduce the risk of burn out. By organizations, I mean not-for-profit, for-profit or public organizations. None of them is immune to this illness...especially the not-for-profit ones like NGOs.And this is without mentioning the ethical conflicts that workers can have between their own values and those shown withing the organizations they work for. And this is another (big) story.
This reminds me of one of my favourite networked computing stories: back in 1990, the City of Santa Monica (California) launched a service called SHWASHLOCK (SHowers, WASHing machines and LOCKers). The idea for this service had come from a bunch of residents, some of whom were homeless, hanging out on the city's Public Electronic Network (PEN). At the time, of course, there was no Internet: PEN was a civic network accessible locally. SHWASHLOCK is the first public service designed on a computer network that I know of.Santa Monica's libraries had terminals connected to the PEN, and some homeless residents were using the libraries. This is how homeless and homed residents were able to come to share a common hangout, and design together a simple, but very useful service. It turns out that online spaces are quite good at removing some of the social markers that make interaction across social groups so awkward (and more power to you, @Laurent_d'Ursel , for overcoming that awkardness!). In the words of Donald Paschal, one of the homeless residents: “PEN is a great equalizer. No one on PEN knew that I was homeless until I told them. After I told them, I was still treated like a human being… the most remarkable thing about the PEN community is that a City Council member and a pauper can coexist, albeit not always in perfect harmony, but on an equal basis.”More info on SHWASHLOCK and its implications for public participation online: http://www.cottica.net/2012/08/29/the-computers-of-the-excluded/
I also have ideas regarding more efficient or senior friendly showering (hygiene) methods, mostly foam based.Recently I brainstormed for a self driving car mod (https://cocreate.localmotors.com/RaMansell/healthy-movement/) that could work in rehab as well, so some ideas are still warm. I had actually proposed to make it incontinence friendly as well. :)
and I know some profs that work in an appropriate sensor field (e.g. Petra Pötschke in Dresden).Hit me if you'd like to sit down to brainstorm a little.
If you are interested, there is now University program called "Migration and Diversity" in this University: https://www.studium.uni-kiel.de/de/studienangebot/studienfaecher/migration-und-diversitaet-maI found that out when discussing things with the people who help out at a refugee center close to there. There ought to be some mutual interest in some of the activities... apparently it is a new thing - so there is probably a lot of learning for everyone involved.
You could host a RC and perhaps keep some of the pieces for parts and training. Of course you can also encourage people to donate some semi-working things or decent enough tools (no one should work with shit tools!)
I've made a draft outline for a German centered effort to do this with the help of the refugees:(download and rename to .pdf - I could not upload easily otherwise)Hmm... didn't work :(PM me if you are interested.
If you want to personalize with few resources - try making your own paint. I recommend you use non-toxic pigment (and still use masks - just to spread awareness), and there are a bunch of non-toxic to fairly harmless liquids to mix stuff into (e.g linseed oil*). You can get a lot done with mortar and pestle for personalization scale.Other things that help are fabrics with nice haptic properties (you can sew together patch-work style). Needle skills are nice to have anyway if you want/have to live low budget. Just make sure you get good thread. Fabric will also improve overall acoustics.Pull broken head-phones out of the trash and fix them (9/10 are broken at the jack, you can fix them with almost nothing, if you are good you can re-use the solder that is already on them. Then you only need a lighter/candle and e.g. some liquid adhesive and string to fix things permanently. A quiet atmosphere and my (home) sounds around me help my mood a lot.LEDs are another option for color personalization instead of paint. If you DIY, just make sure you understand what resistor you need. You will need one unless you do plug in LED-bands which are relatively expensive (but still not bad, you could also cannibalize them). If treated right LEDs will last forever though.*Not sure how well that works on particle board though. Epoxy is the solution that will always work (and can also be used to fix a lot of other stuff) but is potentially somewhat toxic, moderately expensive (if you buy a big just past shelf life bucket), and needs some know-how and tools to avoid a utter uncleanable mess. Hit me if you want more details.
Get some fairly decent CAD skills without the cost. And share some of what you make with the rest of us. Onshape.com allows CAD straight from the browser (of a decent computer or notebook). Check out who is behind it, those are some of the CAD Urgestein folks, and everything is fully legit.Yes, it is a free/commercial program, but currently the deal is extremely fair.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5asam5vmlr0Here is the nuts % bolts video, it is not exactly easy to learn from 0 with 0 help though:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ4ZNLANFWg
@Shajara, the way to go is either let them know in public by posting another story - they receive notifications on email, or go to their profiles and message them via the Contact tab. I can send you a full list of their profiles. I think this last option is the fastest.
hello @serapath!Thanks for sharing!what you're doing it's really interesting! I would like to know something more... how many refugees are already involved? Which are the main results? Refugees need to have particular skills to start?  
True to that. I suspect from how you approach this that the ecofriendly solutions are just smokescreen?I'm a bit swamped now, but if anyone is interested to go through numerous existing sensor apps and see if there is something there.
I'm grateful to Ginette for her opinions and super curious to see if she has experienced victories too in her work, even small ones. In a conversation I had the other day with a friend well versed in NGO work and having quit, she mentioned something suprising to me: that for her it is the proper third sector having a chance of changing things, not the bottom up grassroots. So you see, all sorts of distinctions are being made, but I recognize the bottom line - the need for structured processes, paths to access resources, influence etc.My opinion is not worth much, in fact we can be right and agreeing and still not go anywhere :-| From the years I've been working in this field, what I've seen is doors opening and an ability from policy makers to listen. With unMonastery called in by a city, Futurespotters by UNDP, new doors opening thanks to them and other consultancy work, and so on. It feels to me hard to think about large scale change, but seeing a progression makes me more hopeful than at time zero, if that means much. If Edgeryders is anything of a counter culture movement, than it is also true that from the beginning the position was to open channels for collaboration between very diverse people. And guess what: over the years people in policy making have joined too, and were honest about their own limitations as institution representatives - for example, this is someone who at the time of engaging was in the Amsterdam City Council and here asking about basic income and how it would work. So to me, if OpenCare with the workshops and future activities manages to open a real channel, that is already a win. Then to move forward, I can see the need for someone to pick their battles and perseverate in that.. and who knows how long that takes.   
well not all the time but we get the most sun in swiss..thats why we have the first solar park in europe here...  right..about the project. essentially we are a synergy hub for people who see that we need to strengthen the parallel reality..the " normal" - we work together to make these dreams come true... why do we protest? why do get angry at things? - ...and what good is that going to do when you know how the world is governed... that most of all we see is preplanned and we are just going along for the ride?// well... thats changing... people are waking up to the matrix... and yes... we are making a differnece..and yes we are turning back the tide... our quiet revolution is gaining momentum... and the establishment suddenly realise they wont have everything their own way anymore... we have a long - a very long way to go to raise the consiciousness....but we are doing it here...and with YOUR help... we can make this the EPI centre of that change...
Lovely idea Maria, if someone was about to give some guidace to one who was about to become blind. How would this project put itself among many other possible technologies: Second sight artifical eye implant, a system telling what you see in front (cant remember the link) etc?Is there an objectiv comparitive review somewhere?
Thanks for sharing @Maria, This is not meant to be a negative or pedantic comment because I appreciate the good work.Byt, I feel that we have an ethical obligation to have a critical look at things. We must avoid encouaging engagement in risky business. Too often we create false hopes for those already challenged. I fear that we often superficially oversimplifying things to promote ourselves without realizing/measuring/acknowledge the possible positive or negative impact it may have.I've never been to Senegal so I have to use imagination to analyze the story. I put myself in the situation of a Senegalese who read the story and try to copy the concept, watching the video made by some 'rich' guys saying this cost only €70.I need a workshop: power Drill, bits, saw.... Ok it's initial investment may be covered if I intend producing lots as a business. I need to buy the materials: Pipe, glue etc. (Are hardware stores plenty and well stocked  in the target country? what prices do they practice?).However, I’m sitting comfortably in europe. Have several hardware nearby. There you spend a lot for small quantities. Just to get an estimate I used RS online to get an idea. Pipes:40€, 10 Elbows, etc, a whopping 7€ each, locktite glue 25 €.. Bicycle wheels??? Shopping cart wheels??? (we are not stealing are we?)Your shopping cart will cost me more than 200€.  (See note)Where do I want to go? I would like to see the description of the actual prototype session where someone in Senegal, actually goes through this maker process and constructs a solid wheelchair for another person, listing difficulties, actual costs (tools,time and transport included) Why? Because we have an ethical obligation not to lead people into false beliefs. Not to encourage them into a project that may cost them much more money and resources than they think. Not to encourage taking uncalculated risks and facing a (maybe fatal?) failure. Note I don't know if I looked up the right things, but if they arent I would have wasted further money and failed building the weelchair
Hello Laurent, thanks for sharing your story, really interesting to read about the inside of a collective that i hear a lot about in the last couple of years. I also read your article on Bruzz about the financing and i really wish you luck. I wanted to contact you if you would like to share this story at the workshop event we are holding on the 24th in Brussels? It would really be great to have you also participate in a moment where local organizations can interconnect and talk about care and how they organize. More info: https://www.facebook.com/events/280924708934187/Kindly regards, Yannick 
@Nadia Thank you for shairing this with me! I had heard about it breifly before, but didn't really have a sense of what it was. Seeing the video and reading your description has definitly helped that! I think this is a cool project and would love to see some collaboration with my university and the students behind this. Also, it's a happy coincidence that my cohort's next semester is in Berlin, so half of our students will be there till mid December. I will reach out ASAP and see how we might bring this to Minerva!Also, I am still a bit new to EDGERYDERS. Is there a way to contact all of the students together directly, like a group messaging feature?
Hello, @Alberto ! I think I may have not been clear in that while my school takes classes through the online platform we do live together during the school year. Though you do raise an interesting point of how to facilitate a similar sense of community through online communities. Have been a memeber of a few I think a big mistake a lot of groups try and do is replicate in person activites, like a bunch of people just hanging out through webcam. And to me that will always fall short of the live in person dynamic. I think one answer is to organizng physical met ups based off of promitiy of people, which works to an extent.But for me the best online communities I've been in have used the fact the memebers are so spread out to there advantage. I think a good example of this is Under 30 Changemakers, which hosts discussions and training through google hangouts. Instead of having broad web-chats they pre-choose discussion topics based off of community interests or world events and invite their memebers to bring in their perspective. That way people come in already invested in the topic and feel more connected to the community by interacting with members who share their passions.  Also, another activity that seems to go well it when people sign up to be matched with another random member for a skype session. The excitment of not knowing who you'll met but that you have this one community incommon is pretty enaging. Hope this helps!
True, I agree. :) Thanks, @Alberto
Hello (again)! You've been so generous with describing your path that I can't but introduce myself too - here is my story as a fellow social change worker.I find interesting what you write about the need for different social change outfits that make the actual mission interesting to other sectors, and I recognize in this newer projects which have a sexier appeal to some audiences - to me, the best example is the invention of corporate social responsibility as a shortcut of the private sector spilling into the third sector. With all its limitations, I can see why it is appealing for companies.I'm curious: what do you think was a reason why Gymsana achieved validation and impact? You mentioned that it brought new standards of care for the elderly, do you mean in measurements ? (I browsed the website in French, but couldn't find anything about its impact).
Even better, @Ivan Ezeigbo ! Well, if human diabetics draw benefits from drinking moringa tea, this is more powerful evidence than rats benefiting from being injected moringa juice. When you present your case, I would recommend saying this up front. 
I messaged them on their website contact form, let's see.
Thank you @Alberto, for commenting and reading. No, the rats did not take the tea. We injected the bioactive agents (the contents) of the leaves into the rats. Then we observed them with a glucometer. And yes, I think sipping the moringa tea would provide blood regulatory function. Because during digestion, this enters from the gut into the bloodstream, and that's where it serves this function. I have already conducted experiments on this with diabetic humans too (who take the tea), and indeed the moringa tea has very powerful blood regulatory effect.
Thanks @Alberto.I have just added the link to http://puntozero.github.io/ and the number of students involved (about 150 this year).While seems easier to involve patients, patrons and makers in open discussion about innovation and shared practices, the world of education and professionals themselves should undergo a rethinking towards wide collaboration and practicing in communities in the fast changing, seamless and heterogenous world we all live in.
Very interesting, @Federico Monaco . I guess communities of care start in (medical) school! If people – especially care professionals – are trained to think in that way, they can have more of a positive influence in getting a community going. When I say "a community", I think of responsibility: a community of care happens when people take at least some responsibility for caring for each other.You forgot to include a link to Puntozero in your post.It would be nice to know who else is involved, how many students you have taught etc. 
This project was developed during Hacking Utopia - a three month course on product design for social and demographic change. The course format was developed by Prof. Susanne Stauch (@Susa)  and Nadia EL-Imam (me) in a partnership between UDK (Berlin University of the Arts) and Edgeryders:The Shit Show is an interactive pop-up exhibition designed to make the sensitive, 'taboo' issue of mental health more present and approachable to the public. Psychological struggles are still stigmatized, making it hard to reach out for help. We want to offer an alternative way for people to engage with the topic and develop mechanisms for support and resilience.Mental illnesses are one of the most widespread disabilities worldwide. In Germany alone, 4 million people are affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Yet, it’s a secret we all share. Seeking help for psychological struggles is still strongly associated with shame. Even being sad or stressed or unproductive is seen as personal weakness. As a result, many people find it difficult to talk about emotional problems – be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder.It’s easier to open up to someone who has similar problems and can empathize. But how to identify the people that can offer support when everyone tries to hide their struggles? Most people that are in emotional distress don’t decide to seek help until they have been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Only about 35% of people suffering from depression are receiving treatment. On average, 11 months have passed before even these few seek out professional help. The Shit Show is one approach towards addressing this pressing situation.The students : Omri Kaufmann, Pauline Schlautmann, Luisa Weyrich and Nele Groeger are in here so you can contact them directly) (@Omri_Kaufmann , @Pauline , @LuisaWey and @NeleG )... I know they're very passionate about the topic, and would love to bring this initiative to other Schools and Universities. They're even running a crowdfunding campaign to finance the costs involved. Perhaps there is room for collaboration :) 
@Noemi Thank you for sharing student mental health nurse twitter chat. It's a bit confusing to naviagate, but I will spend some time exploring it! 
Wow, @Ivan95 . At 20 years of age, you are already a researcher and an entrepreneur. Well done. Question: how did you treat the rats? I suppose you did not give them tea... do you think sipping moringa tea will provide glucose regulation to the organism of the tea-drinker? 
Great to meet you, @rainbowheart . You speak of Mont Soleil as if we understood it... but we know nothing about it. Can you tell us more about it? 
Welcome, @Shajara ! This school of yours sounds really advanced. One thing I don't understand is how you make these support initiatives square with its online dimension. Supper clubs and similar cannot be used to string together onoine communities. We struggle with this ourselves at Edgeryders. What are your thoughts?
Welcome, @Oana Geambasu ! Great initiative. I am curious about your community: is the community actually delivering part of the therapy? Or is it the therapists delivering the therapy, withthe community playing the role of informing the families seeking therapy? 
Welcome @Alexander Shumsky . This is exactly the core idea of opencare: communities endowed with both care problems and care solutions, equipped with collective smarts and open knowledge. Note that this is not the same thing as "patients working with researchers". Pharma has this already. But it maintains a hard distinctions between patients and researchers, problem-bearers and solution-makers, consumers and producers. This is about patients being researchers, and viceversa. 
This is great work, @dfko . Congratulations, really. I remember hearing from @LucasG that the Canary Islands, where he lives, are home to 7,000 diabetes patients. The islands have no capacity for insulin production: these patients fly insulin in from Germany. This is relevant to Lucas because he is the man standing watch in case of pandemics: if pandemic flu hits, flights are cancelled and, once local stocks of insulin are exhausted, diabetes patients start to die. Lucas even considered talking to local crystal meth manufacturers: shady types, but the only people on the islands with any organic chemistry manufacturing capacity (he decided against it, turns out their skill is insufficient to make insulin after all). A system of insulin production that is lighter on logistics and more reliant on local production is more robust to external shocks – an additional advantage to your idea.
... that I resonate with the community approach. Care is about relationships, not artifacts. Well done @Rozina .
@Natalia Skoczylas and @Eireann Leverett I guess we need your opinion here. In this comment above Rune raises some real points on IEC 60601 and issues of trust with technology. 
Anna Young is MIT D-Lab. I tried to find a page for the organisation pushing Solarclave, but it's kind of elusive. Officially it's Mujeres Solares de Totogalpa, in Nicaragua (now a cooperative) but their website does not mention Solarclave at all. Should we try to find these people? 
Hi @Noemi @Pauline, is this challenge ongoing? 
I would love to see this collective bid help you figure out manufacturing at scale. For the MacArthur foundation call  on which I'm hoping we'll work together, if we can spin the story to evidence the less experimental part of your work and a solid plan for reshaping markets it would be great. They're looking for durable solutions more than innovation, or so the briefing says. Either way, you win already just by being so daring. Also, not sure if this is valid in your case, but it's possible that fame comes earlier than success - so getting attention by being in the right places and company can help your mission.Hang in there :-)
Thank you for sharing this interesting background info! I've been following the project from a distance for a while.I was wondering: which steps have you taken to involve people abroad or to build a network of contributors for working on this project in different locations? I'm sure there are lots of interested parties globally. The biohackerspace in Ghent, Belgium where I'm involved surely would be.
Thanks @maymay, I just spent a 2 minutes in vain trying to figure out what it does. Need more time.Bug:@Everyone: There is a bug when people make @Someone in the comment. Then the link in the 'Edgeryders.you have been mentioned' mail contains the link to the @Someone and not to the comment. 
Also, @Rune , if you don't know about it, you might find GNU Health an interesting and useful tool for supporting clinic workers.
Your mention of overcoming anachronism and the post-Occupy times we're living makes me think you should definitely meet the guys at BUOY, although they're based in the US - they are building technical platforms for coordinating group actions as their own response to the need for new culture. 
Welcome, @Shajara!I was doing a little research the other day into this group called WeCommunities  for health professionals - they organise dedicated regular twitter chats and  a recent one was "What is it like being a student mental health nurse?" They have it all archived should you want to have a look. I myself need to learn more about how it works, but it seems like there is a need for coping and sharing lessons as a professional too. 
Looks promising @Moriel and the @Noemi triggers me. Have you implemented this on the playgrond yet? I have seen many 'seating' swings and ask myself how yours compete with existing solutions.It could be of interrest for a participant in WeHandU, what do you think?
@Moushira,I'm sorry to hear that it's a 'stellar' solution. We try to be very practical, applied and earth bound. ;-)stage =  version 2.x forked from experience 1999. Hardware 11 & 2.0. (Sorry, It's an iterative process.) We are prototyping the concept within the next weeks.Let's have a chat/brainstorm. I'm very interested. 
@Rune, thanks for sharing, I wasn't aware of WeHandYou, and it is already a "stellar" solution, in my opinion,  thanks for sharing :).  I couln't tell from the link, but do you know at which stage is the project now?
Sounds interesting @Noemi,  we don't know anyone in particular from Night Scout, but, indeed, it would be good to let them know about OpenCare.  Thanks!
Congrats, @Oana Geambasu  !I would like to know more about it. How do the families learn about your NGO? Does the medical stuff tell them or else? How many children benefit from cochlear implants in Romania, is it something the state offers or do the parents search for private solutions?  
We did have a fairly successful crowdfunding campaign, but it was not nearly enough to compensate anyone in the project for their time. The funds raised so far (about $15k) are just providing a small financial floor under us to cover the reagents we need to reach our first milestone and we will need to seek more funding after that to continue the work.It will be a matter of a few years before we might expect to have demonstrated enough success in the work to get the attention of generics manufacturers, and in addition to the science/engineering work on the protocol we will need to get financials together concerning the economics of manufacture at scale, and perhaps results of tests relevant to regulatory compliance. Orders of magnitude more money and resources will be involved. We are only taking the first steps toward bootstrapping to that level right now. But in doing so we have gotten the attention of larger organizations with more resources who might be able to help us in taking these next steps.
LOL, talking about inclusiveness this fits right in and well, a bit over the board - I'm thinking of the need for hyper control over battery life and avoid being trapped somewhere..
Having seen Constantino resurfacing I get the connection now and have a much better sense of what you are up to, clearly on the side of OpenCare prototyping and testing the idea in practice.
I see, well can't say I'm surprised it's difficult to measure, especially if people are transiting.You may know of this already, it seems different services for refugees would start offering spontaneous language classes like this Baobab centre in Rome, which I've come across in another article. Basically you'd have German volunteers teaching people transiting via Roma some basic language in order to be better prepared by the time they reach Germany: she was saying that "teaching them German (or anything else, really) gives meaning to the time they spend here." I found it ingenious and practical. The original reference is here.
@Noemi!Sorry for my late reply!The question if it could be better to be self-organized it’s a well-known question for us. It could be easier for some extents, but at the end we understood that it’s really important to have a “neutral” coordinator, that it’s not a service provider of Italian courses.  The coordinator is the Immigration Office of the City of Milan and so a service that tries to help migrants in general, in many ways (jobs, social benefits, reception centers..). So this view is interesting because permits to have an holistic view of the person. But the question remains open...There is a kind of self-organized network of schools, “Scuole senza Permesso” (“Schools without documents”), but it represents only a particular kind of schools.And yes, a lot of teachers testify that it’s really useful for their job to be in contact with other schools, teachers and approaches, but it’s not so easy to register the results of an improvement in the quality of teaching. This is because you need to have data about the situation before and after, in order to register the gap and there are a lot of other factors that can influence your way of teaching.For all these reasons what I could say it’s that there are refugees and asylum seekers happy to have had an Italian class also in August (because of Italianostranieri Community), but it’s not so simple to measure the improvement in the quality of teaching and I think also that it’s a long-term effect…but for sure it could be great to work on it…
Lucia @lpigini thanks for sharing :)This is really really cool.
So, the conversation with @Rune is going on since some time now. As WeMake I'm pretty conviced to back this project in the opencare realm. We're in the process of understanding the possible implementations but we're totally in.@marcomanca I think that many of the issues discussed above should be digged more during the workshop @cern :)  
@ChristineOehme being the only therapist I could find in OpenCare id like to get your opinion about what would be the best way to access and invite people with certain physical disabilities to partecipate in active selfrehabilitation like WeHandU?And also how we could get a local physio onboard?
Though wheelchairs not my speciality I have seen several solutions presented by scholars. For example:; Stairclimbing see:http://portale.siva.it/en-GB/databases/products/isoSearch?classification=122315 (so the NHS offers zero)In theory its simple: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik286spRM1wwhy dont you just buy one of these? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZLoUYXDSs or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7otewMk9pc( I actually saw one on the street the other day) Who dares hack a segway? And who dares using it?  
@Moushira, with 'Would it be possible to think of a mechanical system that can be attached to all “standard” wheelchairs,  that can revolutionize their functionality of the wheelchair, making it possible to access every place and surface easily with it, while keeping the expenses to do so, within limits? 'you ask for the stars, but if we realize the WeHandU, i'ts about what you ask. You join in with an idea for a solution/someone has a proposal, together we realize. You test the solution and you are happy , U reiterate improvements or abandon. Most important: We and U document opensource the result of the work for others to build on.It's not the stars but wouldn't it be getting you to the moon be good enough ?
Are you aware of the huge international work on ICF?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Classification_of_Functioning,_Disability_and_Health
https://edgeryders.eu/en/doctor-could-you-hack-me-a-neuroprosthesis-please
And here is the latest attempt to bridge the gaphttps://edgeryders.eu/en/wehandu-maker-space-for-developing-solutions-for-cases-of-motor 
Great idea @Moushira my Roomba has cost me 400€, worked 1 year, makes noise and now battery replacement (+100€). I'm not so sure about cost/effectivenes you claim.I'd like to hear what a blind owner of a dog says? Usually people are quite fond of their dogs (and they climb stairs, go outside) Roomba dosn,t pass even small obstacles. Or is this the typically technocrats way to care (my recurrent question to myself)? What does th blinds community say? 
Exellent posts @Moriel, @Alberto, @Noemi. I just want to mind you of the ongoing work of international classification of function, a framework where all these things are being redefined. My personal opinion is that it's both good and bad. The bad part is that it devides people so we speak different languages. The good part is that it tries to teach us all to speak a common language. Within OpenCare it woudl be good to have some consensus about that. @Moriel what do you think about https://edgeryders.eu/en/wehandu-maker-space-for-developing-solutions-for-cases-of-motor ? Would you be interested?
Thanks @Noemi for asking "a series of activities to happen in one or more existing spaces? And where?"What:We have the technical knowledge  (of FES-Functional Electrical Stimulation) to 1 Create a wearable device that improves the hand function2 Hack (or just buy) a device for drop foot (@tamarafuma about that)then we know about a number of other solutions for other physical functions. When you work with people you find solutions.  Where: We need to start locally of logistic issues. Telematics are good but physical contact is better. As said, WeMake is close so if they agree, this is where we start. We need a hub to share ideas, thats where I hope OpenCare & Edgeryders come in. Who: We will be dedicating our spare time to this. For some it overlaps our profession. We need to cover many diciplines (also just as contact persons). We will work to include. Participants will become experts (mentors and facilitators)Future: It MUST spread as makerspaces have spread. Hopefully with shared MISSION and VALUES, concepts of WHAT may differ as local resources differ. Why: Because it will fill a need that the healthsector is not meeting. Personalized, responsible selfcare and building a DIRECT bridge between healthcare professionals/researchers and users.  
@Noemi, you have a good one in "what it would be like for patients to work side by side with researchers". That was how it used to be, and that was the most productive time in scientific history. Now, if you, say, make a survey of what colour of wheelchar is preferred, you need permissions from ethic comittee, legal paperwork etc, = >2k€ and >2-3 months delayThis initiative is not intended as research, not intended as competing with hospital regulations. It's aim is to join experts (=people dedicating time to making mistakes) with newbees (people spending time adapting/improving to new/chronic physical conditions.
Yes @Noemi, I have the great pleasure that @Alexander Shumsky is working with me at the hospital. We have proposed @Costantino to join with WeMake on this one. Anyone are strongly encouraged to contact us, we really need some clinical people or just some epathic persons. Often what people really need is just to talk.
@Alexander Shumsky welcome to Edgeryders, and thanks to Rune for inviting you!I read this and also the full project description, and I see it ties nicely to Rune's question from before: what it would be like for patients to work side by side with researchers and makers. But to be sure: are you working on a makerspace or on a series of activities to happen in one or more existing spaces? And where?
Hi @Rune,True, acupuncture is largely regarded as 'alternative' - at least in the West; it is integrated into mainstream healthcare in China and other East Asian countries, and increasingly in places like Israel and Australia. I would put it a bit differently - it has not been 'becoming' evidence-based in the sense of people changing how they practice. It is more a case of practitioners, who have ample experience of the effectiveness of the treatments in their own practices, looking to find ways to produce acceptable evidence to back this up so it will be more widely accepted by the mainstream.As with all physical interventions, this is not easy! You can't really run a double-blind control study on a physical therapy where the patient can feel whether it's being done or not, and a lot of the resistance to accepting acupuncture involves either rejecting all the 'lesser' forms of evidence for its effectiveness, or designing 'sham' studies that don't really take into account how acupuncture works.All that said, there is still a lot of evidence for its effectiveness for a variety of conditions. The Acupuncture Now Foundation have an accessible summary here: https://acupuncturenowfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANFwhitepaper2016.pdfOr you can look at their research page - https://acupuncturenowfoundation.org/doctors/studies/ - or at the factsheets on the BAcC website: http://www.acupuncture.org.uk/category/a-to-z-of-conditions/a-to-z-of-conditions.htmlI have Chinese colleagues who like to point out that this is just the tip of the iceberg - there are literally thousands of positive studies from China [and Japan, and Taiwan, and South Korea, if you're worried about the quality of communist science] that have never been translated into English...I don't have any evidence of the effectiveness of my own treatments specifically, though! I can't afford to hire a medical research team, so I'm reliant on the already-existing body of evidence and theory. :)
link: Can we afford to neglect this issue?
We have some expert input here: https://edgeryders.eu/en/comment/23839#comment-23839 so if @marcomanca could synthesize his experiences it would be greatOther posts are also having some brilliant points that could be moved to the document.*So some regulatory framework is needed..
To clarify, Buoy is not software for health clinics. It is software for coordinating group action in the field. It does things like displays people's positions on a map, sends group SMS/txt messages, and offers a safer place to store recorded multimedia files than one's phone. It does not schedule appointments or automate clinic paperwork.I do think there could be places where some of what Buoy does could integrate well with those needs, particularly around dispersing knowledge of who can do what (has what skills), as discussed above. But these needs are tangential to the main issues Buoy was written to address.I do rather enjoy automating busywork, so I'm generally very happy to work on systems to "shift admin tasks" away from secretaries/interns/paper-pushers and onto computers. I do a lot of that for friends with bullshit jobs, actually. But that's not really what Buoy is for.You might want to take a moment to read or skim through the Buoy User's Guide and take a look at some of the screenshots on the various pages there to get a better feel for what Buoy is intended to do.I'm not sure what the current "state of the art" for such scheduling software is, but I know pretty much any mature calendaring application tends to have the capabilities one needs to automate such a process. Outlook is probably the most well-known application for this, though it is of course proprietary and expensive.
Forgive me for skimming and missing info already there but I have a questionFor providing good opencare  (check the post No Humane ghost in the machine) focus should be on shifting administrative tasks from healthcare professionals (called facilitators/mentors in our case), so maybe an App (Buoy?) could let the participant (the patient) check in, filling e.g. private data (address etc), restricted data (pathology, symptoms etc) and public data (satisfaction data, achievements etc.) as well as allocating time slots. What's the state of the art of software for that (@Eireann Leverett, @Alberto,@maymay,@Nadia ) ?
@Nadia, your post is excellent and useful. I'll have to check out and understand how to implement "Common Problems you can solve yourself section". As you already know we look for a way to get in contact with local (Milano) people to demonstrate feasibility and then later "have a distributed presence as a compliment to the physical space itself". Also because participants (living with disabilities) will have limited mobility and time. Any ideas of best 'crack'?
Congrats for your work! The money quote for me is:what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions.So looking at your crowdfunding, people not only support, but actually fund scientific research in a crowdfunding campaign. And more so, research that is traditionally funded big time by big companies. I hope your time is also funded, as I've seen on the Counter Culture Labs site that it is volunteer led?How long do you expect it to take from producing the proinsulin to getting at serious talks with manufacturers? Do you need more certifications or proofs of validity of sorts..or would they deal with this once they want to play ball?
Good story @Woodbinehealth. I was searching for the part where starting up is described. How did you gather the people needed to startup? How do you recruit 'clients'?
@steelweaver, this is really interesting. Acupuncture has loong been considered alternative medicine. Lately it has become evidence based. Do you have objective evaluation of the effectiveness of your treatments?
Hello @steelweaver and @Alberto, the reflection about ‘good doctors’ and ‘systems’ triggered me to exemplification.We often simplistic talks about good doctors. They have suffered the longest & toughest study and taken the Hippocratic oath. Only good people invest their intelligence and life so ‘insanely’, instead of pursuing personal wealth. Lately I’ve been several times patient(ly) at (4) hospitals. 95 % of the time you wait, pay tickets, try to get the right documents and wait for someone to (re)-type (using only the indexfinger) your anagraphical details (already electronically registered).5 % of the time a healthcare professional is actually seeing you. That time is again divided into20% waiting for the doctor to read your documentation and check that you paid the ticket etc.10% the actual examination/intervention60% waiting for the DOCTOR to TYPE (with maybe 2 index fingers) your diagnosis/report in the secret language: docterish 10% where (s)he explain/discuss with you. 0.5% (10%*5%) of the time you feel some human treatment!!!99.5% (100%-0.5%) you are just frustrated waiting for your final hour.  I wonder: Before computers the doctors had a secretary doing paperwork and the doctor used his expertice 100% to speak and treat the patient. Who remembers if this is true? claim: doctors are equally frustrated because they are not typists or bureaucrats and wants to do what they are trained to do. Cure I accuse: Technocrats that have made healthcare more ‘efficient’ by buggy information technology. Legislators by substituting common sense and the hippocratic oath with rules, disclaimers, useless consent forms, lawsuits and barriers between professionals. US ALL for electing the people continuing this process of alienation of the patient and healthcare providers.    I support: incubating open care initiatives 
@marcomanca, I do agree to some extent. However we need data. Do you have ideas of the costs & times that you can provide?cost and times should be including applicants cost and timeeg.CE marking a medical device (>100k€, 1 year)Approval  from the ministry of health for a medical device (15k€ >2 years)Patent (50k€, 4 years)and there is more   
Maybe I'm wrong but I though the OpenCare proposal was to shortcut.Shortcut waitlinglistsShortcut ineffective bureaucrazyShortcut documents that separates people and not connecting themI thought that we were supposed to be innovative and find a solution. I got to find out if I'm in the wrong place here. ???
Having a platform where a lot of people talk to each other and share experiences that sometimes contradict each other is a lot like a forum, and making it difficult to arrive at sound advice. What would make it into real collective intelligence is research and analysis on nutrition. This would weigh a lot more than advice from a small groups of food experts (as Rune observes below). If you ever want to go that way and structure information online into a research dataset, or wish to include this in your support raising efforts, consider Edgeryders for partnering up. Alberto just wrote about how you can use network analysis and ethnography to analise texts and reach new knowledge that as a platform manager or user you can't readily see, especially if you have contributions in the orders of thousands.
Dear Rune,  Thank you for your comment. You are right by saying that there are many ideas on healthy food and it's very difficult to find evidence for recommended daily intake of various vitamines. Your suggestion to an OpenCare challenge to gather all data on diets etc is indeed also interesting. At this moment for us this scope would be too wide. We want to focus on the group of cancer patients, while we know that besides the battle of their illness they also struggle to gain the right information. As we mentioned in our reply to Noemi's response, we realise the challenge that it's extremely important to ensure a reliable and relevant source of information for this particular group. Denise and Carry
What @markomanca says about safety and legal issues is important and needs some opencare attention. I've started this section in the invitation letter (it's not the right place but my best shot)https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NKc2bM1FnpQ9zCEveieFr7bIGA9JkI8U_adsBpyma1A/edit#heading=h.5obrk7n45hk3Maybe you could elaborate? 
Thanks @Noemi for helping me out on responding @markomanka.I'll try to go through the points * The transformation of cronic patients into makers is scientifically documented. Something like 50% of patients have been creating an innovative solution for their health problem (SocialMediaWeek Milan 2016) but, either I don’t understand what you mean by ‚stimulus to personal studies’ or I strongly disagree. Production of the device should simply be a joyful and possibly a beneficial process. Avoiding personal defeat is ethical top priority.* Lets make it clear: Quality is one thing, safety is another. Quality depends on the maker = participant. Safety is ensured by facilitator and mentors. Safety is a relative issue. Walking is risky – you may fall, therefore the neurologist may advice stop walking and use a wheelchair instead (a real casestory). As when we do clinical trials, the participant must be guided through a ‚risk assessment’* What you say about ‚bypassing’ is actually the reason for hacking - for opencare. Once you certify your product is ‚frozen’. Yes it’s about bypassing >100k euro of CE marking expenses of a product which the user has to pay (https://edgeryders.eu/en/fes-for-foot-drop). You can't meet individual requirements because youll lose certification.However you have a point. Help us to find a way to ennsure that this is legal and how participants can be ensured in case of accidents. Please?* don't get your point about IP!???? We are in open context, free,* Responsibility and lawsuits. I can see you are a lawyer mind so please help out on this point? (Yes the idea is that the paricipant is fully responsible) How does the makerspaces go about this issue (@Costantino)?* ‚Disabled ones’ are in this case people, the participants, looking for a alleviation for lack of body function. In contrast to established health care ( were the patient is often a passive receiver patiently waiting for ....), the WeHandU (see above reply) philosophy is NOT to decide what is best for a patient. Rather a person living with an impairment is looking for a way to resolve that HE/SHE considers a problem and hopefully resolve/alleviate it in a creative environment (I am often contacted by such people). The ‚not-patient’ but participant is... a participant. People not ‚wanting any aid’ (and they are most) will not come in WeHandU. (BTW. Disabled people is not existing in the modern vocabulary)* Solutions not marketed is a complex one. As graduate student I believed (was taught) that if it works it will be sold. That’s not the way of business. Healthcare is business. Hard cold  business. A businees where 90%  of the healthcare budget is spend on a solution that does not work. 90% (EU data) is spend on treating cronic diseases. Why are they cronic? Because the cure we are paying is not working... ok I’m being cheeky here ;-)   If you study the dropped foot stimulators, invented 50 years ago, there is a ton of scientific work that demonstrates efficiency. Its provided by NHS in england, but not in the rest of europe. Why?* Optimistic research. No, rather pragmatic - If something does not work try something different. The different is to eliminate the last variable (confounder is the term) not yet controlled in 50years of research: FAILING INSTITUTIONS (article on edgeryders).What would you suggest as a cut off for a clinically relevant change?How many people regaining some hand function? How many people walking yet some years before they end in a wheelchair? Would 10 suffice or do we need 100.mio (A cervical spinal cord injury cost society approx. 1mio$/year) What if one of them was you? Would the existence of WeHandU space be justified it it could preserve you some personal independence?We have a choice here: continue spending millions on research refining (reinventing) technology (http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-01/kf-kfa010716.php). Promising technology that has not been marketed or clinically relevant for many years?H0: We can demonstrate that it is useless by testing the last hypothesis (which is that OpenCare approach can solve the ‚marketing’ problem).What do you propose?
Head on  Alberto. How can this voucher be implemented in an efficient way. Are there some tools?Our proposal is that it should be an 'association' of participants (the patients), mentors (patients who done it) and facilitators (e.g. us-researchers, clinicians, etc....)Participants come and see if WeHandU has a solution  that solves the problem. If yes, then they becomes associates with a moral obligation to become mentors (helping newbees). This part should be free. Eventually facilitators time has to be payed in some way (It's probably impossible to convince a professional therapist to work for free)Are there some projects we can learn from?
Good point on the organizations @Noemi. I have several times been trying to involve associations with little luck. They are very interessted, but the buck stops there. Maybe they are too busy surviving, maybe they are too focused on initial goals, maybe,,,, It's clear that they don't have resources to follow and digest current research and therefore are unaware. Maybe they are drowning in information about mainstream research (e.g. stem cells). Maybe you know?Regarding @Costantino, I have been airing the idea of making a 'neuroprostethics' hacking event. We need the right subject (patient), a clinician (OpenCare type) and clear some formal issues. Some people that I had in mind had to drop out (for logistic and health problems). In this hacking event we will help a person to create his/her neuroprosthesis to recover hand or foot function. This could be a kickoff workshop for a project the we call WeHandU - a hackerspace for people with spinal cord injury,stroke, multiple sclerosis. It fits perfectly to a 100k grant coming up in september, but we need to recruit paricipants before time runs out.
There seems to be as many ideas of what is healthy foot as there are people. Where do these ideas come from, how do they develop and are they true? New drugs have to test qual or better efficiency by stringent methods. Food (and established treatments) do not !?Once I searched medline (a database of scientific publications)  to find evidence for recomended daily intake (RDA how many mg of various vitamins etc we need) and found practically no research evidence. What we eat seems to be a result of a roundtable discussion of 'experts (taught by their professors, taught by their professors,,,,,)' .Can it really be that there is a enormous hole in healthcare research here?Could it be an OpenCare challenge to gather all data on diets, vitamins, lifestyle, lifequality ...and do some datamining to provide evidence of dietary recomendations? 
As long as I remember we have been told to eat healthy / As long as I remember hospital food has had the reputation of being awfulAs long as I have been having my lunches in a hospital I’ve studied posters saying: avoid saturated fat, reduce salt & sugar, prefer fibres, vegetables and fresh fruit etc.As long as I have been having my lunches in a hospital the meals have always been salty, something fried, overcooked vegetables and the cheapest quality fruit.So starting at the hospital we are told one thing and given the opposite.The logical conclusion is that change should start at the hospital. It same goes for schools down to kindergardens.  
I’m not sure to what extent @Eireann Leverett ‘s claims are sustainable (missing data). The regulations (IEC 60601) requires thorough documentation of the safety. Anyone knowing the certification process of medical devices will know how much paperwork it takes. This documentation effectively renders the device sort of ‘opensource’. It's accessible to 3’rd parties (regulating bodies etc). Clinical trials of safety has been carried out. Scientific publications (open source) and probably patents (open source) will have been published. Risk assessment  documentation occupies entire folders. The costs to the company forces developers to do their very best (in theory). Yes, it's not open source to the regular customer, but what would it serve?. Afterall it takes an expert to understand. Regulations are born to protect the consumer, but they are resource expensive meaning that devices become excessively expensive in confrontation with production price. (Maybe now regulation monsters have grown to feed lawyers and bureaucrats )Honestly, would you dare to hack a pacemaker or implant one that was running opensouce version 42-beta last edited by someone with an obfuscated name ?More interesting. Is there some documentation that opensource software is more reliable compared to proprietary code with a relevant approvals? The opensource development or hacking is extreme programming where bugs gets fixed, new ones introduced and iterative improvements are taking place. Unless you believe in afterlife I don’t think you would accept being beta tester of your pacemaker. Non life-critical medical devices (low hazard) could be open source, when failures will cause little or no damage. Especially those not being provided by the health service.P.S. I think CE marking the waterdispenser is a lot easier than getting approval for a medical device and there is no comparison.  Bottom line @AlbertoIt would be a great idea to develop a FAQ or rather a book of knowledge/best practice for OpenSource Medical Devices.Please let it be based upon evidence and legal references
Right on @Noemi :-). The article made me reflect on two different associations:1. Often we (technicians) get carried away by fascinating possibilities of technology. Tech becomes interresting in it's own right rather than a means to solve a specific problem and @Moushira has a good start on that. Sometimes it even creates new health problems. Here the the mouse as a modern a health hazard comes into mind (it's provoking RSI, Carpal tunnel syndrome etc. simply put: wrist problems). It's easy to imagine similar issues.2. Some years ago i converted an old pc mouse into a "finger extensometer". Drilling a hole, springloading the optical encoding wheel wrapped with some fishing line. The line goes out though the hole and in the other end it was attached to a rubberring. That ring could be put on the e.g. index finger. The idea was to solve a clinical issue with a tool for the physiotherapist training fingerextenstion of the impaired hand. (The typical hemiplegic hand after a stroke). Either the user could get a biofeedback when exercising finger extension, or it could be an evaluation tool to keeping track on the progress by providing objective measurement of amount of finger extension.If this 'Maestro' can do this task and if it is really easy to clone it could be a good candidate for this work (http://ifess.org/node/824). Currently there are some protocols (using expensive movement analysis labs), but if this could be a 
Hi Pavlos,Thank you very much for taking the time to reply to our initiative!We agree that a varied diet is of big importance to any of us (not only cancer-patients). Can you provide us with more information/sources of research concerning the variety that you are referring to? A core aspect that needs to be considered specifically when talking about "anti-cancer" nutrition is that carbs and sugar should be avoided or reduced to a minimum because they "feed" cancer cells. What we are trying to say with this goes hand in hand with our comment on Noemi's post: to come across as a reliable and relevant source of information, the platform needs to state very explicitly what it is focusing on concerning nutrition, still at one point you have to choose a certain framework of aspects which build the basis of, in our case, the platform. No one can ensure a 100% holistic approach, but you can already get a lot further by having this intention. In the end research today might state that milk (just as an example) is bad for us and tomorrow another research might state the opposite. Its all about the framework that you define and the beliefs you formulate as a basis. Carry and Denise
Hi Noemi,Thanks for your reply, its much appreciated!You are definitely right about the controversiality of advice. Main cause of this is, in our opinion, the so-called island approach, where there is little space for a holistic view on the patient! Specialists tend to stay within the boundries of their area of expertise (even if the advice turns out not to be the best for the particular patient).We realize the challenge concerning our online platform as it is extremely important to ensure a reliable and relevant source of information, especially considering our target group! Your already helping by sharing your thoughts, opinion and experience. We are happy to learn more from experts and get in touch with people that can provide relevant advice! Carry and Denise
Hi Rezina,Please feel free to reach out if you need me. I can also link you in conversation to my Dad who has a much more detailed and in-depth knowledge of the whole system here in the UK.Alex
I'll let you know my travel plans over a private channel. :) Thanks, again.
I have a couple of ideas, will get back to you after fleshing them out a bit more.
This is good sense ethical coding. Well played, @maymay .
I do remember. The person in question is @MoE aka Stefano. 
Oh, @Nadia I should also mention that the developer's chat room is also helpful because I often ask for specific kinds of testing help (that often does not include writing code) in that channel. Most recently was this ask for people to send test txt messages to a certain recipient so I could see the output from different telco providers' gateways. So even if you don't fancy yourself a "developer" the developer's chat is still a good place to be if you have any free cycles an wanna use them to help Buoy development along. *shrug*
Let me know if/when you will be heading there and we can try to work around that. I think I'll be in the US around last two weeks of september. Might be later though.
It would be wonderful to have someone else's experience to lean on, but if not, I am confident that I can build a version of Buoy for Drupal within a few months, much as I did for WordPress. All it will take is having reliable shelter and food for the duration. That's the much harder part. Writing code is easy for me, by comparison. Unfortunately, my current situation does not include reliable housing.Nevertheless, in whatever moments I do have the wherewithal to do so, I think it'd be helpful for me to refamiliarize myself with Drupal and update my understand of its internals using tasks that are smaller than porting Buoy from one platform to another. To that end, I've been looking at the tasks in the Edgeryders Dev and Testing and will hopefully start contributing some smaller pieces of work to Edgeryder's own infrastructure. I see this as a way to create a win-win-win situation.
do you want me to mention your name when I do btw?I believe that memesis is more important than attribution. A more thorough explanation can be found on the Rolequeer Theory and Practice wiki, for those curious, but the takeaway point is that I hope your priority will effectively conveying the message and purpose of the tool. Attribution is nice and can often even be beneficial, but not always, and when that's not so, mentioning names should be a very distant second priority.I can try to keep a lookout for use cases and useful information/articles etc. Maybe also do some advocacy for it by including it in public presentationsThat's cool. Thanks. You can also join up in the public developer's chat on Gitter. You don't have to stay there all time, important announcements will get emailed to you. Just having more people in there makes it at least look like the project is growing. :)I had a chat with the Woodbine crew about setting up an event at Woodbine around autonomy, health and interdependency. A convening, but not just for talking.That sounds fun. If by "at Woodbine" you mean in NYC, then with enough advance warning I might be able to attend personally. Keep me in the loop about this?
Thank you for sharing Noemi, that's also quite an interesting approach. Biotech is still in the early stage, but it should be possible. What I am especially curious about is how we can cooperate with different actors on the controversial issues, like GMO. We don't pick any side, because we don't think there should be polarized sides: we want to tell a nuanced story, which is the hardest task of all. But as soon as you involve big biotech, concerned citizens might drop out and self-censor. The same could happen vice versa. Perhaps it is ideal to steer clear of the subject for a while, there are so many other interesting things to talk about anyway.I've not met @Rozina, but I saw her around on some events in Brussels. I believe she was talking about schools for children with special needs, if I am not mistaken. But perhaps the same holds true for standard schools, we will try and find out :)
I know someone in the community produced a wordpress plugin from Edgesense, a piece of software which was only available as a drupal module. So they must have looked into the drupal-wordpress differences. @Alberto you know who this is, can you remember the handle?
Am checking out the links you shared above for where and how to contribute to buoy. Code is not possible for me. But I can try to keep a lookout for use cases and useful information/articles etc. Maybe also do some advocacy for it by including it in public presentations (do you want me to mention your name when I do btw? Didn't at re:publica - @Mike Gogulski had just pinged me about it ).So two things.1) I had a chat with the Woodbine crew about setting up an event at Woodbine around autonomy, health and interdependency. A convening, but not just for talking. A combination of showcasing/discovering some relevant OS tools, aggregating information resources and working out some social contract/model for supporting work on their further development. I am up for putting time into making it happen.2) I came across an article which you/me/others may find useful. One of the comments had a link to an information resource that @Woodbinehealth might want to include in their resource centre:  "a page called ThereIsHelp with pointers and resources for people worldwide dealing with suicidal feelings or a variety of other complicated mental health issues". I also found it useful for unpacking questions relebant to Boy and community driven care in general...In Wikipedia is not therapy,  the author decribes the emergency response system the Wikipedia foundation has put in place for dealing with signals of distress amongst editors:"This emergency response system was established in 2010 by Philippe Beaudette, the former director of community advocacy who recently left the Foundation to work at Reddit. On his LinkedIn profile, Beaudette notes that during his seven years overseeing the various Wikimedia communities, he and his team responded to almost 500 threats of suicide and other imminent harm to people and property. A recent report from the Foundation’s talent and culture team noted that, in one quarter, they handled five suicide cases that were escalated through the emergency email address.“It’s a stressful thing, for sure,” Earley says. “My blood pressure goes up. It can catch me at any hour of the day. I do feel the weight of dealing with that. But it’s definitely something that feels like it’s important to do. We have the technical infrastructure in place to make it as painless as possible on our end.”How do we effectively deal with the additional preassure, or emotional stress, that this kind of commitment brings into our lives?  
With a bit of luck we might be doing stuff in Ireland in 2017. This might be a chance to scrape off some resources for a Buoy prototype, with would probably include a Drupal module. Let's stay alert. 
and you got yourself a Med Makers revolution :-) 
Thanks Marco, many money quotes in your comment !!My understanding of Rune's post is that research admittedly needs to be refined ("as long as assistive technology is not used it’s difficult to identify exactly where to improve it") in ways that are more just to the users than current commercial research and the incentives that exist in that space. Since research lab + home brewed medical inventions and tools exist already and provide healthy tinkering and reflection around problems, then the easier question is then how to enlarge access to this kind of knowledge, enable more people to be players. More access could mean better quality and approach to safeguards, and then markets (should) follow. Hopefully before research and money go down the drain or results made irrelevant.
Scale was a consideration from very early on, and indeed the current state of Buoy's implementation reflects a rejection of the typical technocapitalist approach of creating a single, highly-scalable centralized service endpoint for all interaction. It's really encouraging to me that you seem to have immediately understood the importance of smaller-scale yet socially-proximous user connections. Most people with a tech background instantly reject this design, because it does not match what they are used to seeing Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other large corporate networks do. Of course, those networks are not interested in user empowerment, but rather control over users (user domination), so the model is clearly different.With regards to trying Buoy out with Edgeryder's community and its possible use cases, two things come to mind.First, yes, Buoy as a suicide prevention tool was one of the use cases we designed for early on. You can have a look at some more use cases along with preliminary Personas we had started to document on our wiki. These are two areas where people who do not want or do not know how to write program code can really help the project out by contributing their own ideas in a manner that will be useful to fellow developers.Second, I noticed that Edgeryders.eu is built on the Drupal CMS. Right now, the only implementation of Buoy is as a WordPress plugin, but I have been wanting to create a Drupal module for it, too. I am not as familiar with Drupal as I am with WordPress, but I have wanted a reason to get back into Drupal development for a while. Also, in my experience, Drupal is the second most popular Web-based platform for the kinds of small- to medium-sized organizations and community groups that Buoy is meant to serve (second only to WordPress). Implementing the existing Buoy functionality as a Drupal module could be really help broaden the reach of the project to more groups, as well as offer an opportunity to rework ("refactor") some of the Buoy code itself.I don't really want to embark on this myself since it's a pretty big task, but if there's interest from other developers in doing such a thing, I would be happy to collaborate on that work with someone (or a group of people) from the Edgeryders community. To anyone reading this, the best and easier way to express an interest in this is to hop into our public chat room and ping me there. (I'm @meitar)
Hello Rozina, really nice to read about your approach to redesign communities and to get more involvement on a local level. Great that such initiative gets the respons of the local autority. Would you be interested to share your story at the Brussels Open&Change Workshop, it would be nice to hear your story and share it with other people to craft new durable solutions out of it. You can find the mapping of all contacted persons that i did at the moment here: https://metamaps.cc/maps/2175 , and you can contact me through mail if you want to discuss further.event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/280924708934187/Kindly regards
Hi Alex, Thanks for your insight and your positive comments. Yes, I agree that it's best to run the BID projects with the BID task force community rather than soley relying on the politicians to lead. Although, at the moment it's still quite challenging for politicians here in Belgium to change the cultural mindset of opening up to public/private/citizen partnerships. Hence why some initiatives have been at grass roots level with the community itself. I sincerely hope this will change over time.I have linked to many of the UK BIDs and they have been incredibly supportive. Also, recently in Edinburgh there was the World Towns Leadership Summit, in which one of the organizers was BIDs Scotland along with IDA of Northern America. It was incredible to hear the stories of what some of the partnerships had indeed achieved in their communities. From Capetown to Copenhagen, it was quite an eye opener. I hope you don't mind if I reach out to you, with your experience and knowledge of the BIDs in your area in the future.Thanks again! Rozina 
More power to you, @maymay . This is a very well-thought through service. What I love most is your response team concept: it works even at the level of, say, 10 friends that live in a 2 km radius from each other. Then, like the best networks, it can be scale-free: suppose I am using Buoy here in Brussels, I have my little response team etc. Next up, I visit my friend in Milano; suddenly I am detached from my response team, but if my friend is also using Buoy, she and I can be on each other's response team. Also, she can ask her own response team to opt in in my own, and viceversa I will be part of theirs. Voilà: everyone in my friend's response team now has skeletal Buoy coverage should they ever come to Brussels – and of course I can ask my response team to add them, too. The scale-freedom there is that my friend and I become hubs, stringing together my local network in Brussels and hers in Milano. I can't emphasize how powerful this is: Buoy is viable at a small scale. I am definitely intrigued by the idea of trying it out when we next deploy in a geographically defined space: this could be Galway, actually. I see in your FAQs that you have already thought of Buoy as a suicide prevention tool. This meets a pressing need in Galway and the West of Ireland in general. Ping @Thom Stewart and @Finbar247 – I think Bernard McGlinchey is also on Edgeryders, but I cannot find his handle. I would never presume to undermine your militant stance. Whatever your reasons, they led you this far, and this is more than good enough as far as I am concerned. 
@WinniePoncelet, yes I've played CLUEDO but it's never occured to me that it's a good edu resource. Whoa.My mom is a computer science teacher. She is organising tech contests and involves IT companies who are very much on the lookout for future hires. They not only sponsor by providing the prizes, but also come and become juries in the contests, and enjoy meeting bright young people. True, they are true moneybags, but thriving businesses are probably not a rarity. Also, the Education Ministry has passed a provision saying that a week every year in spring all schools have the opportunity to insert more creative and unconventional programming in their schedule: "Different School" is called - completely decentralized, so teachers themselves select and organise activities for their pupils - including taking them outside school.Have you met @Rozina?

Thank you for the feedback and your support!!!
Hi and needless to say seeing the super response you're getting already, you guys rock.Just to agree that finding a common language might go a long way with groups that may not be as radical/ adamant in their approaches to not cooperate with state led operations, but rather expose them as irrelevant. I find this quite strong and while some edgeryders will resonate immediately, the rest of us may not know just how to engage even if they resonate with the premises (and keep a different view on the ways, for example me, I got the most out of the FLOSS vanilla interview). Another group with which you guys could click immediately is the Tbilisi activists led by @Nick Davitashvili, who broke new ground in their own way of enabling flood relief efforts or stopping the construction in their largest city park. There could be potential for new tech  - they had to make up a process for coordination, so they enabled coordination through an emergency twitter account texting to dumbphones and worked exceptionally well, as Nick's explained in his tedx. But this wasn't p2p, only for broadcasting as far as I understood.. 
@MarieScheurer @Cindy @HoneyMk well done! With Edgeryders members from all over we will spread the word, let's see if it helps the project. 
I really like what you've written and am excited to learn about the existence of the Autonomy General Assembly. I think this sort of advocacy is critical and echo @natalia-skoczylas when she observes that this sort of work sounds like Bookchin's suggestions for a method to free ourselves from Statist and corporate rulers. I think this is one of the most practical and underappreciated methods to grow sustainable, resilient, and free communities.Also, while I understand the importance of involving "alternative" modalities into healthcare, I am curious about whether your collective has considered how even more basic needs—such as literal access to food and shelter—affect healthcare more broadly. I understand that there is are sensible distinctions to be drawn between, for example, addressing lack of shelter (homelessness/houselessness) and what is more traditionally thought of as "healthcare," but I also speak from experience when I say that the stress of being unsheltered is right up there as one of the worst kinds of stress along with the stress of having a more concrete "health issue."In what ways do the more foundational elements of human care fit into Woodbine's vision for "holistic" healthcare? Collaborations with shelters and food rescue drives? A culture of hospitality? All of the above? What do you see as the most important immediate connections between these "lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy" and what some would call the more discretionary elements of health, after basic survival needs are met, like massages and physical exercise outside of the context of employed manual labor?
Oh, and regarding "what criteria" I apply, I'm sorry, I forgot to answer:also what criteria do you apply when you pick some of these and make work? The answer to this is also informal. There are only two criteria:Do I have the resources necessary actually produce an implementation, andDoes the suggested feature empower end-users and vulnerable populations more than it empowers service providers or large institutions?With respect to number 1, if I do not have the resources (knowledge, time, money, shelter, mental well-being, etc.) necessary to actually produce an implementation then I create an enahncement/feature request ticket on the GitHub issue tracker. You can see all of these tickets (which effectively represent a to-do list) on GitHub here. If, on the other hand, I do have the required resources to implement a given feature, then I apply the second criteria.With respect to number 2, I make a personal judgement call about what I believe the impact of creating the feature will be. As part of this, I consider who is asking for the feature. If the feature is being suggested by a white man who works at a tech company and does not engage in much activist practice themselves, then I am bluntly far less likely to give that suggestion the benefit of the doubt. For example, almost all of the suggestions to "integrate 911 and let people call the police" have come from people matching this description. In contrast, when the suggestion comes from someone who I know as part of a local activist collective, as the example I gave in my previous reply about the Celly replacement, then I may not even bother to create a GitHub ticket because I simply immediately begin working on the feature.Another part of this number 2 criteria relates to how the implementation actually works. For example, the SMS/txt broadcast channel uses IMAP behind the scenes specifically so that non-Google/non-Microsoft email services can be used. While I expect most people will still use a GMail account or similar to enable this feature for their own teams, it's important to me that features built into Buoy do not force end-users towards proprietary, and thus obviously predatory, services. In other words, feature suggestions that necessitate the use of proprietary/predatory services over the use of technologies that can be self-owned and self-operated are more likely to find themselves unimplemented, because I will reject them philosophically.
Thanks, Natalia. :) I appreciate offers for shelter very much.You asked how I decide on what functionalities to add to Buoy. The answer is that there is no formal decision making process. What usually happens is someone with a need expresses that need to me in some manner, we converse about it over some communication medium, and then I add some functionality that hopefully meets that need. It's very do-ocratic. An example will help clarify this.Three weeks ago someone came to me in person and expressed concern that Celly, a SMS/txt messaging service that saw its popularity skyrocket thanks to its use by the Occupy Wall Street protest groups, was no longer suitable for their small group of activists. Two reasons were given: first, the service discontinued offering their free tier product line, and second, Celly began requiring users to install a smartphone app in order to send SMS messages. This causes two big problems for the activist who approached me. First, they have no money to afford to pay for Celly. Second, a significant percentage of their membership does not own smartphones, but rather flip-phones. These two issues are of course related: the local activists are all poor, working-class people.I asked them some questions about what they had been using Celly for. This conversation lead to a better understanding of their use cases. Effectively, they had been using Celly as a kind of SMS/txt broadcast channel for the group, so that one member of their collective to send a single txt message and that txt would be received by everyone else in the collective. The collective is small (less than 20 people).Over the next week (two weeks ago, now), I wrote a feature called the Team SMS/txt broadcast channel into the functionality offered by Buoy Teams. It meets the criteria the activist collective needs, including the ability to use it forever with no additional financial cost. One week ago, groups using Buoy alreay saw an update in their dashboards and could download and install the new feature with one click.That's the usual process.Of course, I have created more "formal" channels for receiving feedback. These include the GitHub issue tracker, intended mostly for coordination amongst developers (and I include people who conduct user testing, writing documentation, and other non-code tasks to be "developers"), the WordPress plugin support forum, intended mostly for end-user-to-end-user volunteer support, our public Gitter chat room, intended as a way to get live support if someone is available to offer it, and our dedicated project email address available with PGP encryption, intended for those who need more assurance privacy but still need a support channel.In practice, however, I am the only developer and have written virtually every line of Buoy's code myself, so GitHub is mostly just me talking to myself, the WordPress plugin support forum has seen some use but is mostly me answering questions by end-users instead of users helping one another out, the public Gitter chat room is primarily me making announcements about my own work to people who are lurking and watching me do so, and the dedicated email address is dormant and receives no mail.I would love for all of these channels to get more use, but the reality is that basically no one pays any attention to what I've done beyond nodding and smiling and expressing how good an idea they think this is to me when they hear of it. :\To wit, that story of the SMS broadcast channel feature that now exists in Buoy? After I discussed the use case with the person who approached me about needing such a feature that could replace Celly, I have not heard from that person on the matter again, despite repeateded attempts to communicate about it over the two weeks since the feature has been implemented. I say this not to disparage this person themselves, but rather to point out a pattern relating to your question, about how I receive feedback. The pattern is: I receive feedback through a variety of means, and am generally able to very rapidly translate such feedback into working features that could be used immediately by the people who approach me. In practice, although the people I've communicated with are eager to express to me what they need, once I actually implement it, I never hear from them about it again.This makes iterative improvement difficult for somewhat obvious reasons.
Thank you for this story, @maymay - I'd like to ask you about the ways in which you decide on what functionalities to add to the service? Both on receiving the feedback and requests from the users, but also what criteria do you apply when you pick some of these and make work? And if you ever want a couch somewhere in Europe, I'd be happy to provide you with one;) I constantly move, but usually there is space for guests where I live.  
Thanks, Alberto.You're right, we can describe Buoy a number of ways. In fact, depending on our audience, we have described Buoy and what it does very differently at different times. If this interests you, I encourage you to watch our interview on FLOSS Weekly, a technology show where we were interviewed about Buoy. Since the show's audience and the culture of Silicon Valley to which it caters is primarily infested with cishet white men, many of whom do not want to accept the obvious truth that the police are government-funded domestic terrorist organizations, I softed my language considerably and spoke of Buoy as primarily a form of social innovation exactly in the way you describe.So while I think you're absolutely right, Buoy can be described as and is genuinely useful as a kind of social complement to existing policing services, I am adamant in my militant stance advocating for the abolition of all police, all prisons, and all Nation States in order to preempt any confusion about whether or not I will willingly collaborate with efforts to, for instance, "integrate 911 as an optional feature for Buoy, too." I have been asked to do this many times, but I will never agree to do it.You might also want to read our Frequently Asked Questions page, which includes a question called "What if people send alerts in situations that aren't "real" emergencies?" which also talks about the "social innovation" angle for Buoy in contrast to a police abolition approach. Ultimately, the two can work together, but only if Buoy and its developers remain committed to the principle of non-cooperation with entirely evil militarized occupying armies, such as police forces.Question: would it make any sense to prototype this on Edgeryders? Probably not, we are too geographically sparse... any brilliant idea?For what it's worth, I answered a portion of this in my comment above when I wrote that "it's also possible for a group (such as Woodbine) to host an instane of the Buoy software but invite other groups to make use of it, even if they are not near the Woodbine clinic itself." So it's possible that Edgeryders could install Buoy and try making use of it. I would be happy to assist with that.Right now, what geographically sparse communities of interest like Edgeryders can do to help (as individual community members) more is to join me and my fellow collaborators in improving the software by contributing suggestions, bug reports, better documentation, and so on. We have a public chat room where we talk about this and help one another get familiar with the software. You are welcome to join anytime: https://gitter.im/betterangels/buoyWe are also big on technical skill share, so if you want to learn how to become more proficient with your technology, we offer a very friendly atmosphere where we teach one another more tech skills as part of working on Buoy together. 
Ping @Woodbinehealth, I think you guys should have a look at this.I took a look at Woodbine Health's challenge-response post and definitely see some complementary challenges with what I've written above and what they're doing. I've reached out to them privately, as well, in the hopes of keeping more lines of communication open for collaboration.What if the health resource centre you are building could have a distributed presence (and network of contributors) as a compliment to the physical space itself? And how could a community support the developers working on it?I don't know if this was directed at me, but I wanted to chime in anyway because it's a great idea that showcases the best kind of melding between the Internet's ability to cross geographical boundaries and the real need (often overlooked by head-in-the-clouds technologists) for having physical-world networks of people in close proximity to one another.One of the things I would like to see Buoy as a project develop more of as time goes on are tools for getting knowledge/skill dissemination (similar to what the Woodbine folks spoke of) in a "point-of-need" manner. By this I mean being able to forward or relay calls for help that require particular skills to the people who have those skills even if those people are not immediately known by the person in crisis. This is actually one reason why I envision Buoy primarily as a logistical and coordination support tool for existing volunteer-run community health or support groups, rather than a kind of individualistic technological solutionism proferred by these "there's an app for that!" product marketing campaigns.There are already tickets in our issue tracker for allowing Buoy users to add things like skills listings to their profiles, but we have so far only prioritized the things that real users are actually telling us that they need. Since, for now, most users know one another and what their skills are well already, we haven't done any of this. But it's something to think about in terms of growing a user base across more geographically disperse regions.Another thought with respect to a more "distributed presence" is that it's also possible for a group (such as Woodbine) to host an instane of the Buoy software but invite other groups to make use of it, even if they are not near the Woodbine clinic itself. Buoy has no geographic limitations itself (it uses OpenStreetMaps for geographical data, which covers almost the entire planet), and a single instance's use is only limited by who is actually using it.On that note, I am already working in collaboration with the Glocal Coop as a contributor to their Activist Network Platform (ANP). This is a tool that allows larger organizations such as groups with national presence and individual regional chapters to produce a network of related websites. We are discussing the possibility of adding Buoy as a default or an optional add-on to that ANP. If this happens, it would offer opportunities for cross-Buoy technical integration that could be very valuable, too.As for "how could a community support the developers working on it?" I hear this question as mostly asking about money and so on, but I'd like to point out that the most progress that has been made on Buoy happened during times when I was sleeping in a friend's closet on my sleeping pad. If I am able to nurture friendships with fellow activists who are able to shelter and possibly feed me, who are willing to try experimenting with the tools I write, I make much more sustained progress on a tool. Money helps, of course, but ultimately I spent all money that I gete on food and shelter anyway, so if I can get reliable food and shelter directly, what use have I for money?Another member of the community who might be interested in this is @Eireann Leverett who does information security and has experience with tech-related privacy/security issues which is a concern.I took a look at Eireann's profile and what piqued my interest was the line "He likes teaching the basics, and learning the obscure." I feel similar, and I would love the opportunity to skillshare/collaborate with more folks with that mindset who have an interest in various infosec disciplines.
Buoy makes a ton of sense, @maymay . Congratulations on the idea. By the way, you can spin it either way: it works as politically loaded displacement of state activities, but it also works as "social innovation"; people helping each other as a complement to public sector service. The police can be out fighting crime, but if you are being bullied in school you probably won't call the cops. And this is without even considering that, in some circumstances, response has to be fast to be at all useful!Question: would it make any sense to prototype this on Edgeryders? Probably not, we are too geographically sparse... any brilliant idea?By the way: I love the 200 anarchist-led refugees centres in Greece. I would love to see a writeup of that under opencare. @Pavlos , do we know anyone? I see two of them are in Thessaloniki... 
Our friend @LucasG has this concept of appropriate technology, which means "as simple as possible". It seems that Willkomm has hit on much the same idea. A lot of the appropriate tech is detailed here: http://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia
..I believe is learning about if and how people are using it, and whether this can be connected with their medical charts, treatment and advice in any way. The problem identified by @Rune in his piece would weigh quite a lot on the way these ingenious and affordable devices are presented as community led solutions:The research contribute with important results, but obviously there is a problem of transferring the research results into the benefit of people with physical challenges - Doctor, could you hack me a neuroprosthesis please?
There is a very good story on the New York Times about a guy who dived into the accessible data about patients and used certain patterns to start fixing the most obvious failures of the health care system. For example, he looked at which buildings in the city received huge amount of emergency visits and hospital admissions - and started solving the problem by opening a practice inside the very building, where patients are taught about healthy habits and watched over regularly, successfully decreasing the number of emergencies and helping save a lot of money. It sounds very much like Bookchin to me: small communities tackling local problems, using collectives procedures and new technology. fingers crossed for your work, it really looks promising;)
Ping @Woodbinehealth, I think you guys should have a look at this.One of the challenges of alternative care provision is evolving tools that enable it around the needs of communities that use them, and support those who develop them. I had a conversation with Amir Hannan, a GP working in the UK, about how  chronic care requires patients to self-manage for good health outcomes (writeup coming soon). Over 15 years he has built a practice based website to encourage an support his patents gain a better understanding of their health to better enable automy and self-care. You can see the site itself here: www.htmc.co.uk (especially the "Common Problems you can solve yourself section - see menu on the left)"...After reading both your post and @maymay above I started thinking about something that maybe we could build into the OPENandChange process.What if the health resource centre you are building could have a distributed presence (and network of contributors) as a compliment to the physical space itself? And how could a community support the developers working on it?I think cracking this could unlock a lot of community knowledge and support, as well as free up resources for providing health and soccial care services to a currently underserved individuals/ communities. Plus it could care for the (far too few) people with deep tech skills that are dedicating themselves to building tools contributing towards fixing the kinds of community resilience challenges we are attempting to tackle...Another member of the community who might be interested in this is @Eireann Leverett who does information security and has experience with tech-related privacy/security issues which is a concern. And not just for high risk users e.g. activists...  
Hi Michel, nice to read you. Regarding your question about the security aspects of AsthmaPI, maybe @Eireann Leverett has come across it or an share some thoughts around how to approach security in this context?  You can read about his work here.
Hi @Woodbinehealth, you've surely raised the bar for us when talking about health autonomy. Not much to add after the insightful comments above, but wanted to commend you for what I see is a very grounded, mixed approach - setting up complementary infrastructure to the current state provided one, enabling training for non-medical workers, prevention coupled with basic treatment.. At the same time you are adamant about the need for a radical, revolutionary approach, and this is where you make a very clear standpoint which to people like Marco above is intriguing. As to your question "How do you work with or around licensures/certifications to provide safe care?" perhaps @steelweaver and his experience can help. He is in the process of setting up an acupuncture clinic at the edge of (commercial) regulations.
Hi @Moushira, long time no seeing! Reading your post about this case also spotted by @Alberto a while ago (Hacking Diabetes) makes me think that between Night Scouts here, the connected diy insulin pumping device, open sourcing pacemakers and many others we're slowly discovering, making people autonomous with respect to their health is only a matter of time and reach. And it's not just vanilla self-assistance, this is real medical treatment.It would be great to be able to contact one of the Night Scout community members (users), do you know someone or should we try to get in touch and invite them to OpenCare? We can do this by offering a writing fellowship opportunity. Let me know!
Dear lovely people :-)We started to create an online curriculum that can teach you programming and goes from "what's a browser" to "how to build an app". It's free and you can have online chat support and if you happen to be in berlin, on tuesdays and fridays you can have face2face support at a local meetup :-)In the future you will be equipped to start your self employed career - either by bootstrapping your own app/company or working as a freelance developer for agencies/clients/customer or whatever else you have in mind. You can work from anywhere if you have a laptop with an internet connection.Check:1. The Curriculumhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist...2. The Support Chathttps://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners3. The regular berlin bases support face2face meetuphttp://www.meetup.com/de-DE/codingamigos/Don't count on the government to magically create jobs. Get yourself some digital skills and start RIGHT NOW! :-)Hope to see some of you people in the chat or in person at one of our regular meetups :-)
A #win already..  Congrats for the future work! Will try to give your start next campaign an even bigger push over the next weeks,  well done! 
Hey everyone! We´re really happy about the feedback! thanks a lot :)From September i´ll be working at the ROC21 Project (http://roc21.openstate.cc). As I already gained a little bit experience at the SAVA project, they asked me to be part of the Team. I´m looking forward to that, because now we can think in bigger scales. We will try to build up a community inside the camp, where everyone is an active part. Thinks like an Urban Garden on top of the building or an actual woodworkshop are under discussion. But there are a lot of issues to face, for example how to motivate people @Natalia Skoczylas it could go in that direction. Would be great to find some kind of reward for peoples work, even if it´s not money. I´ll keep you guys updated!Besides that we still want to realise our modular furniture system at the ICC Berlin. The Malteser are very interested too and already said that 30 of them will be there and help with the workshop! We might get a sponsorship, but it would still be great if we could raise the money via our startnext Campaign. We´re still happy about support :)! https://www.startnext.com/sava Also the ROC21 Project will benefit from the experience we´ll make at the Workshop.  
@Alberto.  Thank you for sharing that article and your comments.  I must admit, being here in the US and have gone to school near some Amish communities, I was quite surprised to see many corrollaries with our work.  There perhaps is a strong negative stereotype ingrained in our culture against these "plain type societies", mainly because of disagreements on their heirarchies and religous aspects.  In addition, across the US, medical students are always taught the example of refusing life saving treatments for children for religous reasons as being paramount to abuse (which can definitely be the case in some instances).  But the article reminded me of the Zapatista models of healthcare, with a strong emphasis on prevention.  As to your specific comments, I definitely agree that prevention is paramount and something that we will emphasize.  But we wanted to differentiate ourselves from other "wellness groups" which focus on yoga and massage and nutrition.  Not to discount them, but the current state of health in the US is that when people do get sick, they are forced to access health institutions.  Most people do not have ready access to primary care doctors (usual wait time is 3 months) and without insurance, it is too costly.  Also, many people who do have insurance, have insurance only for emergencies, hence their propensity to go to ERs, which will always be covered.  And finally, here in NYC, there is always the shadow of Hurricane Sandy which shut down many of the lower Manhatten hospitals, including the large public hospital, essentially limiting people's access to public healthcare for months.  So in that context, we want to be able to provide some care for people so that their minor health concerns can be treated without having to go to the hospital.  But obviously always cognizant of our own limitations in care. Thank you again for the comments and I look forward to continuing the conversation!  
Hello Eric, and welcome to Edgeryders.It sounds like you have some experience or interest in setting up this kind of space :)  Maybe consider introducing yourself to Yannick and/or the rest of the community in arrivals? 
@Tomma, @dennis, @simon.messmer and Liza. We are now starting to push this out and having discussions with a number of foundations, Charities  etc ahead of the #OPENandChange fundraising tour which includes a workshop in Berlin.It's starting to get interesting :)@UNHCRInnovation https://t.co/Scce4LGesV  — Khatuna Sandroshvili (@S_Khatuna) August 12, 2016
Hey @Yannick , thanks for your patience in answering all these questions. The question by @Eric Hunting reminded me of a previous experience with a project called the unMonastery. We had the problem of developing a physical space that was meant to connect to a broader community, and the community was physically far from the space. We discovered that publishing the plans made everything clearer and more concrete, and generated a lot of excitement and emotional attachment. People also started to suggest really cool ideas for furniture. 
Nice to read you. Let's get in touch via private messages here, or better still by email : dante.monson - at - Gmail - dot - comupdate @Yannick : as I replied by smartphone, there was a typo mistake in the email , which I now correctedpps : may be interesting to join the Theory U process for integrating it in a broader perspective ?https://reinventingbrussels.wordpress.com/registration-en/( context : https://reinventingbrussels.wordpress.com/registration-en/ )
thank you for the in dept questionary.We started doing the bigger work in the building the last couple of weeks. We were happely surprised that the water problem didn't harm the wood that hard. On the first floor we have a sort of chill room that is used as a backstage for the bar downstairs as well, a multi media room with possibility to watch movies or have podcast sessions, a closed room for private meetings and a toilet. The second space is used as recording and repetition space at the moment, but will graduatily become multifunctional too. On the third floor we have a big open space with lots of natural light and a working plumbing system. The electricity has been cleaned and we are installing now new wires. We will install a kitchen in low tech design there and we still have space for other things. On the fourth floor we have access to a roof of 40m2 and also a ceiling that was renewed not that long ago, we only have some problems of mushrooms there that need to be taken care of. On the long term we hope to have complete green energy providers , solar is possible. But also trying to create a consience for not using to much energy. On the fourth floor we hope to bring a sauna, sleeping capsules and also an urban garden on the roof, all this is being analysed at the moment.We have 2 handy mans, a designer, a woodworker and an interieur designer helping in the house at the moment. We also have access to different FabLabs around Brussels that will come help us later on. We maybe going to try to contact the bellastock organization of brussels to work around the industrial resources. 
Very interesting @Woodbinehealth , thanks for sharing. We have been talking about autonomy in a health care context mostly influenced by this article about the Amish and their community-based approach to health care. The article is striking on many levels. They use the word "autonomy" in the sense of "a state of not having to be coupled with the world at large in a way we find troubling." Some people in Edgeryders uphold a similar concept, dependency reduction.Its implications are manifold (I have made a short summary here, but I would recommend reading the whole article if you have not done it already). But basically, it comes down to emphasizing prevention. Illness is not only bad for the individual, it is a burden for the community. You don't want that, so you try to take responsibility for your health. You adopt a healthy lifestyle: you still might get sick, but at least you'll have down your best, and you will know that the community knows. This is close to your own attitude, if I understand this right.Which brings me to a question: wellness, exercise, nutrition are the low hanging fruit, the place where you are likely to get most results per unit of effort. Why not stick to them? Why struggle with licenses and regulatory hurdles?And again: you mention sustainability, and well you should. Are your present activities sustainable? Or are they bleeding out money? 
@WinniePoncelet I will make sure to let you know. In fact, I could even come just for a visit of ReaGent, it's really close to Brussels. And yes, I will most likely be at the workshop. :-)
Could you please share some details on the physical condition of the Bonifooi building and how, functionally, the space is intended to work? I looked at some street view pictures of the building and it looks in good shape but very old, though the windows look new. How are things on the interior? What is the composition of the building structure? What utilities are there, and are they updated? What sort of wiring and plumbing? How are the floors set out and are they partitioned? Do you have roof access and what is it like?How do you intended to use the space? Will people live there, in a coliving manner? Will there be a workshop, kitchen, studio, urban farm, etc.? Do you intend to do any sort of light production? Your experience with the N55 spacefram bike suggests you might be working with those and similar constructions. Does the city/landowner allow you to use wind and solar? What sort of building resources do you have at-hand in your group. Is there fab lab access? People with wood or metalworking skills? Is there some good source of industrial cast-offs nearby? 
Thank you @Alberto for the kind words and valuable advice.If you're ever around again, let us know and we'll gladly show you around :). Will you be there in Brussels for the workshop in September?
Thank you again @Nadia for pointing this out.I am not sure I fully grasped the purpose of this, as the text is touching on so many issues at once. I will just focus on the questions to the peers.1. Sustainability can be achieved by any of the mechanisms you mentioned, and more (how about connecting a parallel currency to your activity, creating a membership parallel economy, the likes of Sardex?)... However, the key is that sustainability is not something that can be described in general terms. One has to map the entirety of value chain, and interfaces to surrounding ecosystems, to form an idea of how to become sustainable.2. Again, much depends on what are the incumbents you are talking about, case by case (2 hospitals will react very differently, because their governance is managed by different individuals... even if the general administration may look the same), and by how much, and what kind of, intersection your activities have with theirs... Identifying a few "ambassadors", people that may even be critical but willing to engage and discuss, on both sides (also within your own community) is possibly the first step... verbal communication is easier than written, and maps or other interpretable/symbolic representations can help confronting the different narratives to converge... I would avoid interfacing two different communities by exchanging long texts first :)3. In your case I am not sure why you would like to "work around" any of this... maybe a specific case could help me focusing on a pragmatic reply. In general demonstrating a solid, well thought-of scheme of access to information, education/training, mentoring, and peer evaluation, helps convincing that the operations are sensible and aligned with the purposes of the law. However, there are many details one should consider only on a specific plan: what safety nets are needed for you and your community? Can you keep track of activities and consequences? etc...Registrations/certifications/licensing are in place as fences, one of the tools in the arsenal of safety in healthcare... it is possible to negotiate ways out when it is proven that safety is guaranteed never the less... this may imply lobbying and meetings with authorities, but one can find examples from prior cases that are useful... as instance medical students can practice some medical activities under mentoring before being graduated and licensed... but the University Hospital has a wide safety net set up...It's not impossible to find good solutions, and regulators are often discussing of innovation in this field of regulation, but there are no shortcuts... 
Although I am personally in favour of leaving behind the "fences" of responsibility, and of redesigning the system for accountability and ultimately more pervasive quality... maybe it's time for me to be my own devil's advocate:Systems of fences (certification/licenses/etc) are not always an innovator's enemy. Dealing with responsibility is a lot easier (and often, paradoxically cheaper in the long run) than dealing with accountability.If your innovation is specialized, small in scale, or incremental (hence fitting well in the ecosystem where the incumbents are thriving), maybe it's easier to figure out how to obtain certifications and licenses, than how to establish safety nets and sandboxes to work outside of them (formally, but within the purpose of defending your "users").Don't always start from the assumption that, because others complain about the regulations (often as a narrative to raise their prices), they are indeed an obstacle for you. Do your own due diligence, before thinking of how to work beyond (rather than around) them.
Hi @Denise Carry, I think it is important to also focus on the important of digestion/digestability of ingredients (eg. how it changes over age; how it relates with certain foods, the way they are cooked, the environment they are produced/consumed). This is often forgotten (way too often, I'm afraid), even by most "food fanatics" or "health hypers", who are looking for trendy or aesthetic standards, while forgetting the basics of what makes food. Taking the European population as an example, pasta and rice is not enough for healthy nutrition. A healthy and resilient diet also needs sorghum, buckwheat and quinoa. Modern food trends praise local food, but citizens also crave for bamboo and manioca leaves next to tomatoes and eggplants. Our urban realities demand apples and oranges and strawberries but also crave for pineapple, lichees and papayas. How connected are we with the production-distribution process of these ingredients? How are they imported? Are they imported with care? How do agricultural and food policies affect health and nutrition?
There are hundreds of variations of how people relate to food in different cultures of the world. The actual format might vary from culture to culture, however humans have evolved to have their food in the centre of the dining community. This Centrality of Food is physical (eg. dishes in the middle and people sitting all around them), but also has many other connotations. For example, the power of food systems and food supply chains in influencing/transforming landscapes, economies, territories, habits and human health. In this article, I stipulate this idea on how improving the food system can regenerate an economy in crisis in my country, Greece: http://bit.ly/2a8WhLY. On the power of cooking and actually investing personal time in sourcing your food, there is a very nice explanation by Michael Pollan on why it matters: http://bit.ly/1alPAAX.
hello @dante i went carefully through all your links and was really impressed by all the data and information you found about the different situations in Brussels. I would like to discuss further and share some more insight. Are you around Brussels for the moment? 
In most of Europe schools have no money (I do not know the situation in Flanders). But they make great partners. In Italy, we have a legislation (and, by now, a tradition) of local businesses supporting extracurricular activities in schools. Good school principals build a network of local businesses they work with. So, it could work like this: you involve a school, then – together with the school principal – you target local businesses to support the activity. Anyway, @WinniePoncelet , congrats, that's a great project. I live in Brussels, and will keep you guys on the map with a view of looking you up. We visited Gent just a couple of weeks ago with @teirdes – we would have knocked on your door if we had known you existed! 
Hello Rozina,Thank you for sharing the story with us. It seems that you have many great ideas about how to improve your local community.I have much experiene of the BID structure myself as my home town of Bedford in the UK was one of the first to adopt the structure and my father was the Director of the Board for many years before standing down last year.From a personal note we found that the local council/politicians were very happy to engage with and promote the work of the BID, but that it is wise to steer clear of encouraging them to run the projects. Partly this is because it is better being held in the hands of a non-party-alligned group of individuals. The main reason is that most politicians do not want to be seen to be increasing the taxation of local businesses. Because the BID system frequently demands that local businesses pay an annual subsidy or charge, if it is administered by the city then it is automatically seen by the citizens as a stealth business tax.It is much better for the BID groups to be politically autonomous and to save the time and energy of local politicians and civil servants. This way you get to use that time and energy on BID directed outcomes, rather than them spending it all in discussion and meetings. It really does help get things moving!I wish you all the best for you other initiatives too. Your aims are very laudable.Alex
Great to see you made your way to Edgeryders @WinniePoncelet and thanks @Alex Levene for bringing me into this loop! I am indeed working with Winnie and a few others on an P2P initiative to let people grow edible insects at home. I saw the project as a slow burner. It is hard to bring the P2P approach to the public and it's a constant experiment to find the right approach to get is going. For me and the others, the project is going down on the priority ladder of all our activities... 
Hi Noemi, thanks for that video. The instant sound of kombucha slime landing on that table blasting through my speakers made me laugh out loud during my morning coffee. An example of a workshop is a DNA Cluedo (or Clue?) game where children in group have to solve a murder using biochemical and forensic techniques. We haven't crossed any language borders yet, but hopefully we will in the future :). We're now going to start testing out in what way we can work together with schools. So far it seems like they have very limited means. We will try and make it work regardless, the way you mention might work. Thanks for the tips :)
Thank you Alex. It is funny how you meet the same people in different places. I'm working together with Merel on a P2P initiative to let people grow edible insects at home, as a form of urban farming and food autonomy. How did you come into contact with him?
Hi @Yannick, Hi All. This is great. And resonnates to what I wish to see emerge too. Good to see you are already in touch with various people and groups, good to see overlap.

Hi @WinniePoncelet and welcome to Edgeryders! I checked your website to see what projects students are experimenting with right now but unfortunately I don't speak Flemish :-( Can you give us an example? New biodegradable materials are always interesting, I was watching this video the other day about fabric from kombucha, a bacteria I myself tried as tea (tastes great btw).To your question, I dont know much about business models but I'm wondering if you can finance at least part of the work through collaborations with schools where you provide a curricula and a new kind of classroom, and the school covers tutors salaries and some materials. Maybe you're doing this already? 
Thank you Winnie for sharing this with us.This sounds like a brilliant project, and a great use of resources that would otherwise be wasted.I'm not sure that i know the answer to your questions?But perhaps you would like to make contact with @Merel Claes who is also on Edgeryders and works in the Netherlands in some of the areas you are investigating.
Thanks Yannick, looking forward to circulate this story!
sorry @Noemi and @Alberto i think it got in the wrong place again...
​Thank you @Nadia for pointing this out :)This is an interesting post, touching on a number of open questions, some receiving partial implicit answers in the same text, others remaining open at all.I would like to start from the bottom of it. Transforming patients (or their closest carers) into makers is an interesting perspective. We know from citizen science that this first hands involvement often offers a stimulus to personal studies, and reflection about the identity of the problem, and the problem holder. One could argue this is an even more important potential benefit than the access to the devices in itself.However, an important reflection should happen about quality and safety. If one cannot bring a simple solution to the market because of the iters for safety and quality certification, and this we agree is bad, the solution should not be "ok, let's ignore this step and bypass it".There are a number of issues here. 1st and foremost, one has to describe how safety and quality are reasonably assured, and what safety net would be put in place should something still happen (although we know they are not perfect, to use an euphemism, today a number of tools and services exist to cover for assistance, accidents' costs, etc on the side of providers).Of course, one could ignore this. Depending on the IP scheme, no safety nets would be needed (although it would nice to think of them), for example. But this brings us to a second issue, one that is almost "ethical": transforming every patient in a maker can leverage the citizen-scientist effect only if (this is presented as gut feeling here, but I am open to discuss it in depth later) the right IP scheme is adopted. And only if radical openness is adopted one can truly claim no responsibility over the final "accidents" that will always happen (only that which does not work, will not break). Should the creator preserve control of the IP for itself, one will always find a court that will consider the business model "exploitative", and enforce the order to establish the aforementioned safety nets (there is an interesting case about a fire happend in an AirBnB apartment that touches on this topic)... falling back to the problem one wanted to work around, just a bit later.So, what would be the general ecosystem' services that would keep this garden grow orderly? I don't see this answered (that's not an easy one, indeed)Research, and "citizen science", target the pioneers and early adopters... To scale beyond that, we need to think the entire ecosystem, and be humble.For the sake of our understanding, let me be pedant and allow me to stress that disabilities do not exist in silos. People have many things going on in their lives, and around them, of course also the disabled ones. They do not stop living when they change status. A few will want to pioneer, some will want to have new solutions, some others will not want any because... I am not sure they need a "because".I would like to not dig too deep in the question about why the current "solutions" are often not marketed/offered... just for the sake of reasoning together: if you had a clue about how to build an engine, and it would work once every 100 attempts after serious tinkering... would you be able to market it? Let's be honest with ourselves and remember that researchers are very optimistic people (I belong to the category, so this is self-criticism). They will produce proof of concepts, hardly ever demonstrators (although they usually confuse the terminology), and they don't normally ask themselves questions like "how long will this work continuously?", "what will be the safety mechanism once it turns off, as instance because of battery exhaustion?", how many scenarios are realistically recapitulated in the lab I used for the tests, and how well does this solution generalize?",...Let's not dive in the argument of healthcare provision on this topic. Sometimes it is the right reflection to face, some other it is populistic... In these circumstances it reminds of the sentence I have recently read on twitter "being poor means having too much end of the month"... it may steal a smile, but it's a classic example of ill-posedness. You will not solve poverty by trying to shorten the calendar. 
It just occured to me that @eirinimal could be interested in this piece on resistance to cheap hitech assistive devices. Did your company get to work in the medical system per se or are you mostly marketing outside of it?
@Tomma first off: congrats for completing the course work, @Nadia was nice to give me a small update and I'm happy for you guys and hope you'll continue on this road of very thoughtful design!For ever new, exciting and personalized design, did you try talking to commercial furniture designers or the like.. a company that could help take this even forward somehow? Or maybe the team at ROC21 can help? This is a handmade table produced by the roma community living on the outskirts of my hometown, in a rubish dump . The table was purchased by a hip bar downtown (I think that at an auction..) and is currently under great use. Photo from Made in Pata Rat facebook page. I will see if I can get in touch with someone who can better report on this story.
@Moriel hi! I managed to miss this update of yours.. I wouldn't worry about accessibility though, although interesting distinction! Disabled children are anyway accompanied all the time, so there would be someone who can carry them outside the wheelchair and to the swing.I was browsing the Hacking Utopia site and came across your latest work - so you ended up settling with memory foam. Did you manage to assemble a prototype for the exhibition? and if so, what was the response? 
Hi @Moushira, I took the liberty to add it so that it makes for an even better read!While browsing the web quickly I came across several recent articles introducing different robotic canes (including one equipped with a camera invented by a 16 year old), all equally cheap to make, that are still presented as prototypes. Wondering how come this hasn't, many years after, become more widespread..  
We're building the collective bid for the MacArthur Foundation's 100 million dollar grant with peers in several countries and I think you should be in it    http://tour.openandchange.care
Extreamly interesting case Alberto, will make sure to read on it and include it
I posted that a couple of months ago: https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/a-challenge-on-autonomy-in-careAt the time, I had proposed we roll out a challenge on autonomy and responsibility. Pre-welfare states (19th century), welfare was basically invented by European mutual assistance societies, in turn part of the workers' movement. I imagine that, in the early days, these societies were small enough that the choice of treating someone would visibily drain the common pool of resources. So, in those days, maybe European factory workers thought a bit more like the Amish. A modern-day version of that, though I only know anecdotes about it, is implemented by @lasindias . I think autonomy is also an interesting scenario in terms of policy, and fits well into @Lakomaa 's and @Tino_Sanandaji 's institutional economics framework. My summary from the article: The Amish refuse to have insurance. "When someone gets sick, the church collects alms to help the patient cover expenses."This might happen at a time when the community has other objectives as well ("setting up a farm for a young couple"). You can ask of the community to support your treatment, but its costs are not simply discharged into an anonymous "system": they are borne by your own brothers and sisters. As a result, everyone focuses on not spending more money than is necessary, and "[Amish] communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention".For this reason, the Amish use genetic screening of children. Prevention is so important that its benefits trump the disadvantages of dealing with the world at large.They develop their own treatments (one for burns is described in the article). They navigate, with some difficulties, the interface with the mainstream medical world: clinical testing etc. These treatments tend to be very cheap. Communities negotiate discounts, which hospitals are willing to offer in exchange for payment in full at the time of service. In one example (a child treated with surgery for colon cancer) price was negotiated down to 19,000 USD from 172,000, a 90% discount. "For Americans with health insurance, it may come as a surprise that hospital costs are negotiable". The Amish don't sue. "When the Amish told [a doctor] they understand doctors are human and make mistakes, he had to pause to let that sink in. To them, he was not simply a member of the medical establishment, but an autonomous individual doing his best, given the choices and information before him." 
@lasindias has some recent experience of something similar. I will not go into details, if they feel they want to share they will...@Susa and I had a chat with Glenn from the Woodbine collective in New York about their own approaches towards building autonomous and resilient communities. And they are especially interesting to me because unlike the Amish, they are in the starting phase. As Glenn described it a subgroup in the Occupy movement decided that they would focus their energy on teaching themselves, and others, to become self-reliant communities. They do this through a kind of structured learning program along tracks, when we spoke they were just about to start building the health track. Which reminds me, I need to get back in touch with them!  
Wow, they set up surgery camps in the most remote areas. "All of his equipment fits in just one yellow duffel bag" - it feels like a dream to be able / allowed to do this ad hoc in first world countries. 20 years later, their model seems basic yet very advanced, working at scale - they've built up a huge network of partnerships, residencies, training camps, on-site mentoring, volunteers exchange programs.Have you met anyone in Nepal involved in this @Natalia Skoczylas?
Thanks Natalia and Eireann for reporting on this. I had read Marie's story a while ago on the internet and was impressed by the humility with which she had approached medical security. After all, she rightly stated that the benefits of having the pacemaker far outweigh the risk - which is why probably many patients are looking away or de-prioritizing this.I'm also reminded of @Rune's story where an upgraded medical care also needs an alliance between patients/consumers and researchers (he's arguing for more system availability for cheap, effective medical tech).
Wow, this is great news indeed. Welcome @Eireann Leverett ! I was at that talk at 32C3. It was a real eye opener. It's all very good and well to make fun of the Internet of Things: my favourite is the Twitter account Internet of Shit (https://twitter.com/internetofshit), that churns out a sad/hilarious/scary gallery of smart diaphragms, Internet-connected pet feeders that starved your cat to near-death because the server went down ("It's literally just a timer! WHY does it have to be online? Oh, right, so that they can show me cat food ads"), and keyboards that predict your next keystroke and leak all your keylogs all over the Net. But when you are running that stuff inside your body, that's where it gets a lot less funny. I love this idea:preparing a consumer training and equipping people who rely on medical devices with knowledge and clear questions they can ask about their own devices.A sort of FAQs, of checklist, if I understand correctly. Does it make sense to try and prototype this at one of the Open&Change events in the fall? 
Maybe it makes sense to embed the video in this postwith a Support us on Startnext! button linking to the fundraising page?
Nice to meet you @Denise Carry, I'm Noemi!One of the most schizofrenic thing about medical treatments is, in my opinion, controversial advice. I always tell myself that the moment I will have a real condition I will need to ask for many many opinions in order to be satisfied with recommendations. Even with the "healthy food" trends which you remark, it is becoming harder and harder to find truth or specialists with real credentials. If hospital dieticians are in the wrong, then the only way seems to be more access to information, and at some point the more accurate one is filtered in.I like your approach, and maybe reading about other online communities could be useful to your design: for example another edgeryder in Benin is running awareness raising for cardio vascular diseases on a massive facebook group, but the reason they manage to keep it relatively uncontroversial, as far as I understood, is that: 1) they don't deal with curative or palliative care, only preventative and 2) they have moderators ensuring a healthy and accurate stream of information. This is their story.Also, how can we help?
I am mostly available. Let's make an appointment on a private channel. Just go here: https://edgeryders.eu/en/user/34/contact (Edgeryders allows you to email members, while still keeping their email safe. 
Hey Jort, please add me on skype : notwistgirl I should be available some time tomorrow, just ping me;)
Hi @Alberto and @Natalia Skoczylas,Would you be able to participate in an interview any time soon? I'd really love to learn from your experiences and have your input for my dissertation. I'm aiming to graduate at the beginning of september so if you could find some time to help me out soon that would be very much appreciated! Please let me know, Jort. 
I am wondering if the community would have gotten better if it was organised by the groups in question instead of the municipality.When talking about Italianostranieri you mentioned that it was useful as a coordination tool for schools - to help them come together and share knowledge. So they probably got better at teaching the language (not sure if you measured results?)But did it become easier to learn a language, from the point of view of struggling foreigners? Do you have a story from the other side too, @Franca?
Appreciated! I do hope @tamarafuma and researchers like you Rune can find a more and more powerful voice advocating for more suited tech - the arguments you listed in your other post seem solid, as well as the solution - [as I understood it] if they're too expensive and or not provided by hospitals, we have enough of advanced research to make them more available ourselves.
Hi again! If you guys have the crowdfunding video up online somewhere it would be great to share it!
I do not think anyone else will come from Edgeryders.
Yes, this is indeed a good solution for getting treatement. But not for surgeries, or patiens coming from all over the country to the main universitary medical center, in the capital of Romania, patiens with special cases who need the most skilled doctors arround them until they have a diagnose. Actually, the current Minister of health, Vlad, is also coming up with solutions to rebuild the hospitals into viable clean insititutions.
I can see it being a solution. Setting up someone with an IV is not rocket science; many people can be taught, and then help their neighbors who were not taught. Like with defibrillators: the Community First Responders scheme in the UK teaches people how to defibrillate each other in 3 days: http://www.communityfirstresponders.org.uk/
Yes, @Alberto, there were many times when I was just travelling to the hospital to get my IV and then go home. There are also private clinics where people just go and receive the cytostatics. Though, for surgeries and patiens from all over the country this is not a solution... 
This is a dark, fantastic story @Sabina U . Thank you for sharing. So people developed a true phobia of hospitals, seen as horrible places, dirty and dangerous.Maybe Romanians would be more inclined to reverse the hospital model. For many conditions, you do not really need to be in a hospital all the time. If you are going to have to provide food and clean bedsheets for your ailing family member, you might as well do it at home. This leads to a lightweight system, based on clinics rather than hospitals. Are you aware of any attempts to do this?
This makes a ton of sense. Everyone says that sport and healthy food are good for non-sick people: they should be even more important for people who are sick! I, too, lead a reasonably healthy lifestyle. I do not have cancer now, but – realistically – I will at some point. And I will want the same kind of advice that you also looked for. I would totally support this idea! @markomanka , you are a doctor. Any thoughts?
Good piece! It seems you are saying that, while pathology might lend themselves to classifications, patients are all different (@markomanka always says this). My diabetes is different from yours, because you are not overweight and I am, etc. This calls for small batch solutions rather than cookie-cutter solutions. Makers are efficient at small batch, industry is efficient at cookie-cutter. So, for health care, it should be makers. It should not be so difficult to set up something like a voucher system for disabled people. You've got a condition? Here's your voucher, head off to your local makerspace, someone will talk to you. There's a condition, though: you'll need to be an active participant, not a passive consumer. You'll need to help with design, testing, providing feedback. In other words, you will need to join a community of makers. Your exact role will depend on your skillset and enthusiasm: the harder you work, the better the outcome solution will fit your particular condition. Right?
Very insightful piece,  thanks Rune. When writing OpenCare we were inspired by the story of a visually impaired person in Milano building his own self standing cane as an everyday support for various tasks requiring both operative hands. He did this in a makerspace. @Costantino, are you guys at WeMake seeing collaboration with researchers in similar cases? Or are there events which can aid that? Reading carefully the above,  there's one thing that strikes me: how come patients associations don't lobby for provision of assisting technology outside the formalised hospital care? Isn't this the kind of thing that they would be best at, being on the *organised* patient and consumer side? 
What I don't understand is this: are we looking at a personal device, maybe wearable, or at one that can be shared? Is it one kit per person or one kit per village, sending SMS alerts to several people? I'm betting one per village – CO2 levels are probably farily similar across the same village. Dust can be more of a localized problem. What do you think, @Costantino ?@Michel  : I think the sensors are shown with no shield in the video because Amiv wants to show how the kit works. This is a prototype, not engineered for mass production.In general, with this kind of project all components are cheap. If it is one kit per village, the easiest would be to buy three of everything, and simply replace a component as it breaks down.  
Many people surviving a stroke or living with multiple sclerosis are having difficulty of walking. Partly because they have lost control of the foot movement. When we walk we automatically lift the toes  of the ground or we will have a dropped foot (left picture).      The stimulator above is providing a more physiological way to correct this issue (right picture). The device is very simple and once the price was only around 300 euros. Now they have become quite expensive as @Noemi found out ;-) 
My apologies. Ingress is the precursor to pokemon go by niantec. It's 'build occult force fields ' instead of 'catch them all'While built on the same geodata as pmon, The ruleset of ingress requires/encourages collaborative play to capture the pokegyms / portals, and further to create network links between them to control areas.So lower level players are incentivised to assist and build upon the work of others and swarm to a greater extent than I'm seeing yet with pgo. Haven't played either extensively but that's my impression, and for purposes of design imagination my sympathies  
Uh – sorry @Thom Stewart , I do not understand what you mean... 
This, but also (because networks)There's something about the earlier prototype, ingress 
Alex, you might find useful this post I wrote about Pokemon Go and its possible future applications. It probably doesn't tell you anything you don't know but....https://futureviewsblog.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/gotta-catch-em/
What a great idea!"Toys have great supply chains", therefore they are cheap, despite not being cheap injection mould stuff anymore, despite having a significant engineering content. And "you may not have the courage to take a part a 1,000 dollars medical device, but youy definitely have the courage to take apart something that costs 5 dollars." Conclusion: for DIY to really work its magic, things have to be cheap. The cheaper the better. 
Really interested in how this could evolve, with my previous collective (www.softrevolution.be) we experimented around wellbeing of the elderly in festival context for young people, it was small scaled results, but when we followed it up at the retirment home it had long term results giving those elderly that participated in the festival a higher moral boost. We did something likewise at the moviefestival i'm working at where we had groups of troubled youth help design and build an installation, could look back to it how the results went. Mixing the known expirience that i have i'm definitily curious to look at how we could empower people who tend to have extremist behaviours or tendencies through art and culture. 
Hi @Constantino,It's looking great, this kid is a genius. Thank you for sharing this. It's really a huge step assistance for asthmatic people. I think that sms message will be the most popular reminder...While I'm just  worried and curious about the way to store it safely maybe in a box ?! Some of those sensors don't need to be covered isn't it ? If any part of the peace is broken or need any maintenance like "over heating", is not easy to fix and to find a new one here in Madagascar. 
Hi Michel,thanks for sharing. While I'm looking for other possible solutions and experiences in the "maker" realm, please take a look at this project: Arnav studied the causes and effects of asthma and came up with the AsthmaPi which uses a Raspberry Pi, a Sense Hat, an MQ-135 Gas Sensor, a Sharp Optical Dust Sensor and an Arduino Uno. It is programmed in Python and C++ and triggers email and SMS text message alerts to take medication and remind patients to go for review visits. There is also an accompanying booklet which describes the condition and how to treat it. The sensors on the SenseHAT are used to measure temperature and humidity and the MQ gas sensor detects smoke, nitrogen compounds and host of other airborne triggers.http://www.tech4goodawards.com/finalist/arnav-sharma/@Michel What do you think?ciao :) 
Sorry for updating this post only now. I have fresh info from the organizers. @Costantino and @markomanka and @Alberto and @Lakomaa and @Rossana Torri please forward to anyone who is interested.We need to register to the event. The prices make it clear you need to register *early*, I mean now. Click the "Je m'inscris" link.We are scheduled for a 30 min talk on Friday Oct 21st. Who's in to give the talk?Some challenges already have been published.  Go take a look. (You may need to create an account to access the challenges.)UBx might propose a challenge around mining discussion and networking (surprise, surprise, ...). Who's in to propose another challenge? WeMake?
it contains community insight on the interface between care and the arts. 
OK, interesting. Young men are an important focus in general, I think. They have comparatively higher tendencies to addiction, aggression to self and others, and ideological narrowness. What do you think is the potential of transfering your idea to other communities of young men (i.e. not working in tech/online communities)? I'm thinking about those likely to be vulnerable to extremist ideologies, or drugs, or other obsessions that strip away capacity and agency.   
Of course you did. Sorry about that. :-)
Hang in there, @Michel . Hopefully some of our more skilled community members can get in touch with you. 
https://edgeryders.eu/en/arrivals/a-belated-hello
Since the MENA region is the focus of this call, you could reach out to @Hazem and @amiridina and @Uli and @Hegazy ... maybe a brainstorm would be generative? And of course you are welcome to use Edgeryders as an applicant UK organisation. 
@brady I am personally a fan of "analog" location based. Your point reminds me a bit of the Walking Ethnographies in the alcyon days of unMonastery Matera. But hey, this is just me cheering you guys on from the sidelines, this will be whatever Alex and the team that assembles behind it (hopefully including you too) make it to be. The Edgeryders mantra is "who does the work calls the shots". :-)By the way: welcome! Any friend of @johncoate is our friend. If you get the time and inspiration for it, it would be nice for you to present yourself in the Arrivals group. 
Hi, Alex, et al,I'm not in Europe, so have little to offer there, but I am also in the (very) early stages of an arts/culture/therapy/social justice project here in the San Francisco Bay area, so am interested in listening in, offering my own experience, etc. I teach theatre (along with running The WELL-- I'm here because John Coate told me about Edgeryders-- and follow a lot of people around the world doing cool stuff with arts + healing.As a related aside, my spouse is a local historian working on neighborhood levels and has been working on archiving (& making publicly available)  an enormous photo collection, and is looking at ways to share that as a way of doing enhanced map-based walking tours, etc. (The old photos and crowd-sourced info about them could show up while you were exploring a neighborhood-- there are some things like this already, like historypin.) Not as fancy schmancy as the Pokemon Go technology, but a way to be location-based.It also makes me think a bit of Nonny de la Peña's work with immersive journalism. http://www.immersivejournalism.com/Happy to sneak into the loop if any calls are happening.
I think you're right about the universe wanting this to all happen.Well done for all your hard work with Galway. Looking forward to getting even more stuck in with the Culture Team in the next few weeks.
Hi Bridget,Thanks for your insight. Having someone who has engaged with the funded before would be really helpful when i comes to opening a dialogue with the organisation. I really appreciate the thoughts you've shared here.I think right now that the strength of the work i'd want to develop would be around the social/cultural therapy end. I have an early stages crazy idea that i'd like to use a platform like Edgeryders to encourage engagement and story sharing from people working in the tech/online communities (often, but not exclusively, young socially disengaged men with a disproportiately high risk of mental health disorder and often lacking in social support networks). My idea is currently that these stories, poems and thoughts could then be collated and presented through an number of ways, but my favourite (right now) would be to create an app that uses the same technology as the Pokemon Go system. Allowing these poems or stories to be placed into a real landscape (perhaps one that the writer identifies strongly with). People can then download the apps for free and engage with the works outside. Encouraging people to share, to go outside and see their words, but also to see others engaging positively with difficult truths in an anonymous way.As an idea/project, it's right at the egde of my abilities but i think it might have enough edges of interest that might draw in other ER people if we can find a way of funding their work to develop the tech/care sides.Super early days right now, but i think there's a bare bones idea in there somewhere that has real value.
Firstly, huge congratulations for the success. I hope you are celebrating tonight.I won't expect a replay til later in the weekend whilst you recover from the celebrations, but i'd be really keen to touch base with you in the next few days about what you are going to do next and how i might be able to graft some of my ideas around that.
Hi @Noemi, nice to hear from you again. I already meet up @Tiago here in Madagascar,  I'm sure he knows enough how things going here.I didn't start yet with education for all because I don't have enough tools and I need to develop something that reattached on it, like who are the target as adults ,youth and childrens who are related to different services such as solar canteen, class room, school supplies, personnel and budget for this. About @Alberto questions, I don't know if there is any community for that. I can start with some people who are interested and make one. 
Great, and as I just got fired from my other work, I have time to help much more. If you could share with us the document you have created we can all have a peek and start collaborating. If I have some good ideas for funding, will let you know as well - this might be suitable for example http://on-the-move.org/news/article/17919/british-council-cultural-protection-fund-2016-2020/
Great! This is getting stronger and stronger. Also, now that Galway won the title of ECOC 2020, it becomes a natural point to anchor some of these activities, in, via @Thom Stewart and his group. I expect the ramp up to 2020 will be slow, despite best intentions, because the city will first need to build a delivery structure and that will take months, if not a full year. So, best to look elsewhere (like WellCome) for seed grants, involving the Galwegian contingent from the get-go. Also: @Nadia will soon be announcing another pretty awesome (if totally crazy) opportunity: a decentralized bid to 100 and change, a competition that awards 100 million dollars to a group with a credible take on solving some big problem. "Decentralized" means that we will be proposing a smart swarm of initiatives around the central concept of community driven care. Both Galway and Flow (Bridget's company) could be part of that. Nadia and Noemi are putting the finishing touches to the process, which needs to be robust to accommodate many people and orgs. 
...I could be. We could help with the 'story of change' for an application, and audience outreach and evaluation elements. And as you know I'm interested in thrivability, which is basically about seeing mental health in a very holistic way including environmental and physical, social and cultural dimensions. 
@Bridget McKenzie are you saying you are interested in working with us on this? @Alex Levene : I can vouch for Bridget. She participated in the original Edgeryders exercise, and she impressed us all with her smarts and compassion. 
Ok, good to know..I was browsing some formerly funded projects and for example in this call for Collaborative Awards in Humanities and Social Sciences it appears that they do fund community inquiries. Of course, we need to scan the calls thoroughly.@Alex Levene I can think of a few more edgeryders whom we can invite to be part of this, the only thing is we need to do the groundwork ourselves. On the fabulousness side, the universe is bent on us making a leap with our culture team.. THIS. #win #Galway 2020!  
I've done quite a lot of work on Wellcome funded sci-arts projects, or directly for the Wellcome Trust. A couple of thoughts about what would work with them. They would want to see collaboration with scientists/academics to explore new/innovative areas of connection. If it engages with practitioners in mental health/arts therapy, there would need to be a strong theoretical and experimental element. In terms of what they support, they veer more to the neuroscience & pharma end of (mental) health research, than the social/cultural therapeutic end. If OpenCare is seen as challenging Big Pharma, it might be a little anathema to Wellcome. But I don't know, it's worth exploring.
Super-interested whichever way 30 minutes time goes.... 
..hi @Michel, glad to see you managed to post! I think what @Alberto is asking is if communities, or if people like you can take care of this faster or in a different way than doctors - because, like you say, this problem is out of their hand and it's not a priority for the system.Have you already started with your solution of education for all? Can we help? By the way, another edgeryder here @Tiago also thinks that we need to make alternative information available for many more people. His work with solar kiosks (also in Madagascar!) is here if you don't know each other already.  Also, Jean Paul @jdossou80@yahoo.com is running an information spreading group to learn how to prevent heart disease in Benin - they are using facebook for this. I found it inspiring..  
Hey @Tomma - I'm really glad to see such a constructive idea being realized in Berlin. It's absolutely essential for a myriad of reasons. I was also wondering lately if you thought of taking similar activity one step further and creating sort of economy inside the temporary shelters/housing - so that the produce of the inhabitants could be sold outside, either as affordable fixes for the houses, or maybe as crafts, if higher quality materials were provided? 
Hey @Alberto! Actually Malagasy government on something else. Since ever,the health department is on a vitamin A and mosquito net campaign,  vaccination against poliomelite "weaknesses of ligaments" every year. And there is no update since 2006, The Malagasy Institute of statistics on deep water. Just for record, a doctor is caring a thousand people so 1/1000 people, we are estimated about 20 000 000 habitant.Here is a picture of a doctor make you know how it's look like on administration building for public health. It's happening they pay from there own money to get gloves. 
Hello @Michel , thanks for this great story (and thanks for taking the time of writing in English, unfortunately most people in Edgeryders do not speak or read Malagasy). Wow, I had no idea asthma was that common in your part of the world. I am wondering if asthma treatment would lend itself to cheap, open source, DIY treatment.it is a chronic condition – plenty of time for the patient to learn to manage itit is treated with well-understood drugs which are delivered with relatively simple machines (inhalers)lifestyle and environmental modificiations also affect it – as Michel says, defend the forest, asthma management gets better for everyone living near it.This sounds like something communities could try to crack. Does this make sense, @markomanka and @Costantino ? Would this be a possible area to work in?
"A human project, rather than a corporate one." Herein might lie one of they keys to open care. @Ezio Manzini might have something to say here...
Sorry for some indecent pictures. 
The initiative was taken over from the founder and a few volunteers from the Grey Dhaka group who took it on a pro bono project. Then teamed up with Grammen Intel to help teach the community to make them. Treating it as a human project rather than a copyright corporate idea. @andra @Alex Levene @Noemi
Thanks for sharing your short doc @Pavlos.. it does feel hopeful, looking at the young people taking on activities that traditionally were assigned to older, more rural populations, and mostly to see them taking on brand new skillsets. Where I come from (Romania) these small islands of change exist as well, but young farmers can't cater but for tiny markets. For the more traditional producers, we're talking subsistence agriculture and farming. With such small subsidies (someone in the video mentions 1500 eurs per year), how did they eventually manage? Notice I'm asking this two years after the movie was made. 
Hello! I really like the fact that people are getting involved into this kind of initiative, especially because of the diversity (of people) promoted. I encourage you to ask for as more and diverse feedback as possible and try to engage as many different types of people as you can (different cultures, mentalities, needs when it comes to cooking etc.). I’m sure they would like to help you out with this, as it’s their interest too. Also, I think the way you test the land, step by step, may be very helpful. Are you planning to do any other initiative like the cooking with the minimal utensils one? Or to do it again, but involving other groups of people? Have you got any new conclusion based on this activity? Let me know, I’m curious. 
Hi! I really like your idea and I think it can work out very well.From what you presented and how funny it seems, I think people can easily take it as an adventure call and that’s nice. But I think you should pay attention so that the purpose of your project is understood: the fact that it’s referring to refugees groups. For example, is the app going to be in German? Or what other languages? Refugees might have difficulties learning German (and not only refugees, newcomers too)… How is the project evolving, by the way? :D
@Irene Lanza introduced us to the project a while ago, and I found it very interesting that while it usually takes a lot of "manual" training to learn echo-location - basically to hear acutely the echo of the tongue click, this kind of tech mediated approach can speed up learning.Have you guys managed to move beyond prototyping? Are results coming along nicely..?
..but maybe @Maria knows more?
The article contains a few phrases I really liked and I would like to express my delight about them. I think of the “Can other senses compensate for sight deficiency?” problem which is asked at the beginning. Also, I think of the “a technology that enables blind and vision impaired to mediate their perception of their environment and interact with their surroundings” thing. This is such a nice, simple and healthy way of talking about the project and building it. I checked the website too and I liked the fact that it says a lot about the project and what's coming next. I would really like this to extend and I hope to hear more about this in the near future. Thanks for sharing! 
I honestly think this is a very interesting and practical idea. The ones involved in this activity didn’t only help those people be more comfortable with the weather conditions from there. You helped the environment too. (Now I’m thinking about the long time that it takes for plastics to biodegrade – such a well-known problem.) You basically killed two birds with one stone. I think this is the kind of initiative we all need to solve the problems around us. So happy for this! Well done!Also, are you planning to extend this project into other countries or regions? Do you have the resources? I’m very curious.
I really enjoyed reading this article and I find familiar to me some of your influences (the Tumblr users, I’ll check out the others at some point)! I actually talked with my mother (who is a psychologist) about this. We both agreed that this might help a lot. Young people feel attracted to creative ideas and not that typical solutions to problems, especially when it comes to this uncomfortable subject. I encourage you to keep going and develop this project. But let me give you a little piece of advice: just pay attention to the way you express your way of thinking about this project, as the subject is not that nice and easy to work with. Also, don’t forget to ask for as much feedback as possible (especially from young people, who might be open and curious about this – like I am).Thanks for sharing this and good luck with it! What are the next "challanges" going to consist of? Let me know if you need a young girl’s opinion. I’m really interested into this subject and I would like to give some help. :)
This is a fantastic and fascinating story.I've already suggested this as a possible build project to help support people living in refugee shelters in Europe. I hope that we could find a way to implement it during the summer months.
Early next week we'll know about Galway anyway, I think...
I've started looking at the posibilities through the Wellcome trust. There's an expectation that work will work mostly with UK/ROI partners and collaborators, and be made mostly for audiences in those countries. That doesn't preclude the integration of partners/audiences from further afield so i think there's a strong opportunity to pull in Edgeryders from around the OpenCare community if they're interested.My initial thought is that i would want to wait til Friday to find out the result of the ECoC bid from Galway, but i will start to think about other possible projects that fit into the OpenCare framework and interest me from an artistic perspective.Perhaps i should have a conversation with @Nadia and @Noemi early next week when i've gotmy thoughts in order
The trick is build an application where the alliance between you, as an artist, and Edgeryders, as deliverer of OpenCare, has added value for the funding agency. I see plenty of potential to do that. I am available myself, but probably @Nadia is the person most on top, who knows most about the stuff that will happen starting in the fall around OpenCare.
Yes, an application would make more sense. I wouldn't expect Edgeryders to actually create the grant themselves.I would be happy to take the lead on developing an application that fits this purpose.We would want to have a discussion about how we might approach this process, and what we would want a successful outcome to be, but otherwise i'm happy to use my time and energy to start this process.
I assume you mean "Edgeryders [should] develop a grant application that brought together the OpenCare strand with those of us on the cultural side", right? Like, apply to the Wellcome Trust or similar?It makes a ton of sense. As so many things in Edgeryders, it needs somebody in the lead. Would you be prepared to lead?
@TINO SANANDAJI, thank you for this clear writing, very well explained!  or me, it was important to know the difference between inovation and  disruptive entrepreneurship, and  evasive entrepreneurship. Another example of such action is also the movement  Let's do it,  https://www.letsdoitworld.org/, originated in Estonia, who now functions  like an institution, but it began on a smaller scale, as a private initiative. That could also be a challenge for the status of the evasive entrpreneurship, because when the initiative grows, it also grows into an establishment, with rules and  papers to fill etc etc. And I could also give an example that does not relate to care giving, but to arts.There are hundreds of music composers (who write classical contemporary music) who do not register their scores to any property rights companies, because this is a difficult and long procces, to many papers to fill for artists and too little gain.So many of them just give their music to different performers who do not pay rights to play the music (they are also poor and need to make a name for themselves)The avantgarde art is  usually very far form the industry, there are no kings who would hire composers for their courts :), and it is impossible to make a living from actual art, most of them have other jobs. So, the evolution of modern music is made by simply avoiding the institution of author rights when dealing with indepenendent performers. We would not do so, though, when dealing with National Orchestras or  other rich established music institutions :)  
And after all of this inspiring stuff, I am going to offer some information I have come across, and that is going to sound dry and heartless in comparison. :-)There is a concept at the crossroads of evolutionary biology, anthropology and psychology called cultural evolution. The idea is that, in humans, culture and biology intertwine dynamically: evolutionary pressure makes us evolve mixed packages of genes and culture that make us fitter for survival. These packages repurpose and harness pre-existent packages. If you want to know more, this book is a fantastic introduction. Researchers in this area have figured out why humans have evolved rites of passage, which can be very costly (in some tribes, young men especially have to go through gruesome trials to become full members of the tribe). So where's the benefit? The benefit is that these rituals cement the tribe's cohesion, making it more fit to withstand intergroup competition, a major driver of human evolution (and suspected to have been a driver of non-human primates before we came around). How can rituals cement cohesion across participants? They harness certain biases in human cognition. For example, it has been found that doing things in sync enhances the propensity to cooperate. Consider the following experiment.Participants are randomly divided in two groups. People in group A are asked to perform a simple physical act in sync with each other, like clapping hands. People in group B are asked to per form the same act, but not in sync.All participants are asked to play a simple game where they need to choose between a "cooperate" and a "defect" strategy, like the Prisoner's dilemma. Members of group A have a measurably higher probability to cooperate.So, to make strangers connect, a sensible strategy seems to be to "think like a hacker" and exploit the biases in human cognition, such as the tendency to cooperate more with people you have done something in sync with. A major bias is that we seem to be hardwired for forming groups. It is very, very easy to make humans behave like a group – check out Wilfred Bion's work for that. Obviously, this same kind of hacking is successfully used every day by racist groups, who succeed in making people hate and despise other people just like them, who have never hurt the haters and whom said haters do not even know anyway. Like the Force in Star Wars, human cognition has a dark side... but you guys, I',m sure, will stay away from it. 
Hello Moushira, this looks really interesting. Where did you find it? Did you actually talk to Hugo or others in his team? I ak because, in order to process this information into an ethnography, it is important to assess who is the source (the "informant", as ethnographers say), and how far removed he or she is from written text. More information is in our Data strategy. Especially p. 10-11 contain data quality-enhancing advice for cases in which the informant can't or won't themselves write their own story. 
Back in the hippie glory days some of the more spiritually-inclined ones of us routinely engaged in this sort of mini-meditation with another person. It wasn't structured; we would just do it when we felt like it.  It often led to better mutual understanding and empathy, which was usually discerned in whatever conversation followed the session.  
This might be of interest to @Tomma @dennis @Liza @simon.messmer @Luisa @makerphil and.. well so many others :-)
@NoemiIt seems to me a great idea. Maybe the community call could be like a “Welcome door” for the platform. In effect in these last days I read a lot of different stuff on the platform, different topics, a lot of comments, of comments…So it could take a little bit of time to understand where and how to contribute.So if, at the end of the call, every one that is newcomer could have this link, this first post, he could start to write from there. Less confusing and more effective!Let’s try!;)
@Noemi, it was great talking to you this afternoon, thanks again. Your link will be of much help as well! Hi, @Natalia Skoczylas, thanks for the reply :) I do have some specified questions, they're mostly related to why you are motivated to use the platform and what interactions happen on the platform. I can share them with you beforehand or simply talk them through with you over Skype. I'd really appreciate interviewing you! Could you send me your e-mail address or send me an e-mail at jortklarenbeek@gmail.com? And @Alex_Levene, thanks so much. Early next week should work out perfectly! Could you, too, send me your e-mail address or send me an e-mail at jortklarenbeek@gmail.com? The theories might sound a bit complex, but the interview questions should be fine! Hi @Alberto, I've heard (and read) quite a lot about your work. Impressive, to say the least! Although Media and Entertainment is indeed a long shot away from network science, the platform can definitely be viewed from that perspective. In some way or another, media and entertainment can be related to anything. In the case of Edgeryders, I can reference your community work mostly to marketing strategies and theories, such as Kotler's Marketing 3.0, but also to theories on co-creation and brand communities. Noemi already explained to me that this perspective is not one on which you base your work (at all) here at Edgeryders, but the similarities are still there. I would really like to explain it a bit more detailed 'in person' (over Skype) and possibly interview you. Would you be willing to cooperate?  
Hello @Jort Klarenbeek , welcome. We are delighted that people want to study Edgeryders – I am doing so myself, from a network science perspective. But, Media and Entertainment? That's not how I'd classify whatever it is we do. Are you sure we are the right subject for your studies?
Basically an update of what you have been doing over the past years, to make it more cost effective for you to get back on track. Someone will document and post it online straight away, without you needing to make too much effort. That way it's easier to find opportunities for you in OpenCare - right now I have no idea what your aspirations are related to care and communities (broadly understood).Sharing key stories could also be interesting, don't let me stop you.Let me know eventually if you will make it on Monday, I created a new event with the same link as las time: https://meet.jit.si/opencare  
re: my observation above. I was just listening to one of my favourite podcasts Invisibilia, and their latest episode talks about mental health patients and alternatives to failing recovery systems all over the world. Like some here already intuit, meaningful help can come from supportive community environments (interesting examples from a town in Belgium called Geel where families host "patients" for decades!, or housing sites in NYC with 40% mentally ill people living among the others).A key takeaway for me personally is this: in a lot of cases what breaks how we think about mental illness is the belief that it needs to be fixed, that patients need to go back to some initial state of wellbeing; families, through proximity and attachment, are most prone to exemplify this in the daily lives of someone recovering after treatment - through a way of expressing emotions like 1) criticism 2) hostility 3) emotional overinvolvement. The mechanisms seem complex (can be subtleties, or just body language..), but it turns out that all 3 point to how difficult it is for family to accept and empathize, and only load too much pressure on the person in question. Strangers, on the other hand, do not really care THAT much and can be better healers because they "don't see you as a bundle of problems that need to be fixed". But: they do become kind of like a second family, so not complete strangers after all.I looked up some of the original studies attesting psychocultural effects on mental recovery - pdf here.Highly recommended. 
For next Monday's community call, share which are the key stories from OpenCare from my perspective. Is that it? If so, it's a good idea! Still don't know where I'll be therefore can't say if I'll be able to make the community call, however will post on the platform. Works for you?Thanks @Noemi for showing the directions! :-)
Hi Jort,As Noemi said, i've been around on the Edgeryders platform for only a short time but i'd be happy to help you in any way i can. You might need to explain some of your theories and concepts as i'm more of an 'interested bystander' than a technical expert.Like Natalia, i can fit a Skype session in during the day early next week. Let me know if you want to speak.Alex
Welcome @Jort Klarenbeek , I could help you out - do you have specified questions? I could find some time next week for a skype as well. 
Hi @Tiago and @Franca, this is for you and for those who couldn't make it to the call:With @Alberto @Costantino we got sidetracked from the actual discussions around Meetups Adventure due to some different opinions we have about how meetups would support the bigger community building efforts. In the OpenCare research project we have an engagement strategy to converge project activities by ER, WeMake and all partners into stories and conversations between participants which would take place on this platform. Those will become research data and will result in a report for our funder, the European Commission. Now: we have a basic Engagement strategy based on our project proposal. You can read it here (it's very short and mainly to guide partners efforts). Where we are having difficulties is in implementing it - due to some technicalities with the funder and our own challenges to coordinate all efforts and support the OpenCare conversation, which is the researh engine of the entire project (we are mandated to drive "collective intelligence" around community driven care solutions). A lot of this is detailed issues.. not sure if this is the place for what could also be boring stuff for people not involved in the operational side of opencare.What would be great as an actionable for me is to convene key stories to be told in the community calls and report on those with minimum effort online.We need to make it easier and cheap for people to share stories.So how about in the next community call we start with ourselves? Tiago, for you this is a quick way of fixing the time gap of your being away from ER :-)
Brilliant!
I asked about the work with producers because it's not obvious from your website - which looks more like a pitch to clients.Very interesting, this bridging. I think I understand it, thinking too at how Edgeryders the organisation interfaces with clients and community as a facilitator. You operate under a novel model that respects market principles, but at the same time innovates in rewiring dynamics between traditionally disconnected stakeholders. And if you guys know how to package the story of localized food and taste, well you surely must be already riding this new market. 
Hi again @Jort Klarenbeek! Not sure if I sent this to you previously, but this post (should we incorporate?) from back when the organisation behind the platform was becoming an organisation and the debate in what was already a community is telling of the dynamics. I already asked @Natalia_Skoczylas & @Alex Levene if they want to be interviewed, let's see. Natalia has been around for a while, and Alex for less - so you could get different takes.Talk to you later.
@Tiago:These are exactly the questions we are dealing with right now. We started off with honeycomb cardboard as you see on the pictures because its very easy to work with even if you dont have proffessional tools. The Problem though: it´s not long lasting. The stuff we build with the the refugees about a month ago is already loosing its shape.Thats why we´re currently working on prototyse out of chipwood tied together with cable ties. two cheap materials that you can get everywhere. The only tool needed is a drilling machine. One Set of wood panels can be assembled in three different ways according to the needs. The cable ties can be opened if the people want to build something else.How can we make it personal though? Are people still motivated if every Box looks the same in the end?@Alberto:The Camp we are working in, is quite open. As long as its not dangerous in any ways people can bring whatever they want. That seems to be another Problem: every camp has different rules, so its almost impossible to find a general context.     
I think the key lies on addressing the full spectrum of subsystems that effect food supply chains: physical - cultural - digital - logistical. It will certainly help if you get public procurement (ie. in urban areas) into the game, since their supply chains can really have a huge impact. In the EU only, every day there are 10 million public meals are served for free (hospitals, schools, jails, etc.), all paid by taxpayers money. This makes a strong case for asking for more organic, more local, more healthy, more climate-friendly. Our cities are going through a transition, and the hope is that as generational renewal is happening in city councils, this change will becoming more apparent.
'By this multilayered, multifaceted enterprise @Pavlos wants to change the paradigm. He believes that if the way we think about the time and space of food, meaning the time spent on preparation, growth, the human experience of food, it will have an impact on climate resilience, climate justice, biodiversity, water and soil conservation and will boost regenerative economies in rural areas. 'Really love this way of thinking. Getting back in contact with the producers is one of the joys i found myself having the last couple of months. But how do you scale that up? Where do you set the time to deliver the knowledge to a lot of people? how can you coordinate that? 
@Pavlos , you absolutely rock – and thanks @Natalia Skoczylas for sharing. I am intrigued by this: Pavlos has seen plenty of interesting and viable practices and conclusions forming from the bottom-up, grassroots practice in Greece.Can you say more about these practices? I, for one, would be interested. 
I do not know much firsthand about depression and mental discomfort (lucky me). But I have heard that positive messages are not uplifting on depressed people, on the contrary. If you have doubts about when and how much to be humorous, you could look around for research about the matter. I am sure there must be loads, though I myself cannot think of anything... 
Thank you! I think the main thing we are trying to do is make this topic more approachable. More than humor it's perhaps about the casual language and the interactive methods like the simulators and surveys. Of course it is still a serious topic and the options for professional help should be presented in a serious manner. We don't want to make fun of the shittiness itself, but rather criticize the social standards concerning emotional wellbeing, in a somewhat satirical / cynical way. As far as using irony or humor to embrace the shittiness, I think that's very personal. Those comics that we mentioned for example often deal with these issues in a funny way and receive many comments saying that it's helpful. But surely there is also people who deal with it differently. 
My connection was too slow and unfortunately I couldn't follow. Intention is to follow up and try to catch up through the platform. Any assistance on what to read first would be greatly appreciated.Thanks! :-)
I really sympathize with this approach @Pavlos . Do you plan to open source your method in any way, so that others can, as you say, be inspired by what you do?
@Noemi! too difficult! I cannot hear anything and I was from a phone of a colleague.I asked every kind of burocratical permission ... I hope to be able for the next time... sorry! :((
@Alberto gamification is the right word. The app works as a city-rally including different types of challenges. We are already in touch with institutions like bars and cafés. Still we have collect more but this will happen as soon as we get it expanded. We work on it.
@Noemi! Have you alredy started the call?
I agree, @Ezio_Manzini. Specifically, I agree with your item 4. An analogy: Edgeryders is enabled by openness (in both the sense you mention). Openness is a big constraint on how the Edgeryders organisation is built and develops. For example, the need to stay open (and be perceived as such) drove our choice to be a not-for-profit: this choice signals that we are not trying to be extractive in our social contract between company and community. Similarly, I expect heavy conditioning of openness on the design of open care services. 
Thanks @NoemiThe page says "access denied. 403 error"... :(but ok for Hangoutssee you late!
Keep trying and try also google hangouts. If the latter works we'll move there, just to make sure you can join :)
Dear @NoemiIwould like to join the call but I cannot open the link https://meet.jit.si/opencare.Is it normal? You can open the link only some minutes before?I'm working from a pc od the City of Milan and so maybe we can have some problems..Could you help me? Thanks! :)Franca
Definitely! There are several documentary crews coming over to Greece in the last 1.5 years with some really great questions.Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0KNbKvYn5wAnd here is my documentary "Farming on Crisis?" (2012), which shares the stories of young people returning to the land, in seek of ways out of unemployment.I do believe that in the context of #Brexit, there are several interesting lessons to be learned from the social solutions prototyped by communities in Greece, what I like to call the "Plan C". Producing a positive, thoughtful documentary film for the transition process happening in Greece is an idea I am very keen in discussing further.
Most agencies/companies/communities etc, use the rather industrial/reductionist term "from farm to fork", thus missing two important aspects: "from seed to farm" (eg. biodiversity) and from "fork to stomach" (eg. digestion/human health & nutrition"). I totally agree with the exciting proposal "from seed to compost/soil", as this would really close the loop (eg. recycling).When designing menu concepts at We Deliver Taste, we have an acute focus on human digestion. This doesn't only have to do with the quality and transformation of ingredients (ie. the way a pasta dries influences the survival of certain enzymes that are beneficial to digestion and energy conversion in our body cells), but also taking into account different physiogeographic elements that are related to the kitchen (ie. how does temperature of the type of water in a certain location affects digestion)? When talking about "food waste" we usually focus on poor post-harvesting technologies, market anomalies, food choices, etc. But what if we extended our view at the molecular level of our food consumption, for example, how do our food choices affect our organism's ability to digest and thus convert energy for moving our muscles and brains? Looking at the modern, industrialized food systems, the biggest food wastage happens inside our bodies.Prototyping in the physical/cultural/digital/logistical aspects of the food supply chain, bringing transparency and education in the food supply chain -both locally and internationally- is, in my opinion, a very, very potent tool in improving wider social/political problems. Maybe because food occupies the largest share of the global economy, so any change has considerable impact. Or maybe because people just connect!Once this happens, when cities start looking at their supply chains in terms of an "urban metabolism" (ie. energy/food going in and out) then we can start designing supply chains that connect the urban with the rural in equal terms.
After researching and working for several years with small scale, artisanal farmers and grassroots communities (ie. Slow Food & ARC2020) our team at We Deliver Taste decided to bring a transformative process into the market, because it is the markets that need to change. Our vision is to bring more transparency and education in food supply chains and the market, thus empowering all actors involved to become real game players. New technologies and open data systems are proving to be really strong allies, allowing for more personalised service, more market awareness and more efficiency, without having to sacrifice the taste quality and cultural story of food and its territory, in the name of "competitiveness". The producers we work with are the real actors at the bottom. If they provide us with the right tools to work (eg. good quality, nutritiouts ingredients), then we are able to pass them over to talented chefs, who become themselves storytellers of these foods and their territories. We believe that this is a trully bottom-up process, where we as supply chain managers become the facilitators of this process.Our clients (from small family businesses to large companies) like this approach very much, because they understand that from one side there is more public awareness, on the other there is no much skill in the market to support this transition. Maybe it is true that we "provide a service for a market", but it is also true that we see the "market" as an "Agora" which is not merely a space for economic transaction, but rather a place for participation and dialogue. Connecting conscious consumers with the stories of responsible producers is proving to be very strong. It just happens to sell well, too, so we as researchers don't necessarily have to find a job for a large multi-national agrifood company, but rather try to provide incentives for us, our clients/friends and make the system work for everyone.In terms of criteria for selecting producers, thay are not really imposed by us, but rather suggested by the principles of agroecology, organic farming, social enterprising, family enterprise, with know benefits to the food market, "from seed to soil".
I have written to the maker from India, who told me that after the huge publicity they got last month (due to a short video going viral in social media) they could not start discussing a possible collaboration until October. One thing it that we cannot really wait, when there is such a huge demand/need already now. The most important, though, is that what we're trying to set up here is a positive example of closing the production/consumption/(non) waste loop by connecting small local actors that represent the links of this chain. Hopefully this will inspire more communities to think likewise, so I would say that the focus is on process design rather than the final product.Additionally, there is certainly extra (environmental) benefit from making the product locally, instead of transporting it from India. This would also require an import company, possibly also huge bureocracy from outside the EU. The whole idea of monitoring all the metrics involved can also be views as a social experiment, in our effort to better understand the lean economics of regenerative systems. These plate offer a pretty good use case, in my opinion.
Wow, interesting. But here's what I don't understand (and hopefully @Pavlos can help me here): Pavlos wants to recreate the whole system necessary for producing such a dish - an industrial designer who'd made the moulds, a baker, ideally struggling to survive in the market, a flour producer, etc.Why do you think this is better than importing? If this is a value chain that can efficiently deliver the dish, a small (social) advantage can be had by locating it in Greece rather than India, but at the end of the day everybody else (Italians, Germans, Austrians...) would still be importing... from the company at the fountainhead of this value chain. Or is it a sort of  open system, with each camp using open source knowledge to make its own? 
Thanks for sharing, @Tomma , and welcome to Edgeryders. This was really inspiring!Exactly the same point about young men not being catered to was made by @Alex Levene in the context of The Jungle. We have been fantasizing about "emergent" refugee camps being made of only a welcome committee, fast Internet and construction material; the newcomers themselves would build what they need. However, authorities really dislike (one could almost say fear) such an outcome. Interesting stuff was built and deployed in The Jungle (even a theatre!), but then the people in charge started searching incoming vehicles for construction material. It was completely disallowed to bring anything to make anything into the camp. How is the situation in Berlin?
Thanks for sharing. It's highly surprising and instructive!I understand the context is not favorable for such thinking as there are many unmet basic needs, however it wouldn't hurt to give it some thought: in an exercise attempting to overcome the 'disposable culture', here some warm-up question I came up with:How might we build reusable furniture in a refugee camps?How might we build long-lasting furniture in a refugee camp?How might we build environmentally friendly disposable furniture in a refugee camp?How might we build furniture in a refugee camp that I'll want to keep later?I don't mean to say these are questions to be answered, rather just using them as stimulation to get to some other question(s). Or just forget about them if you think their rubbish! :-)I'm thinking on strong materials but it could be many things really like making it personal, giving it an emotional side to it (more than it already has), for example using pictures of friends from the camp, signatures, words. Could this become some sort of 'souvenir'? Could this be sold to the locals? (also serving the purpose of integration). Maybe it's something that serves different purposes (multi-functions)?Some inspiration: - cardboard furniture (http://inhabitat.com/tag/cardboard-furniture/)Again, thank you for sharing! :-)
Thank you @Natalia Skoczylas for sharing this inspiring reality! Thank you @Pavlos for doing such a beautiful work! I find this particularly interestnig: "Even though Greek politicians and intellectuals in many cases seem stuck decades ago and their resistance to change is huge, what's happening around proves its inescapable. Pavlos thinks the best for them would be to funnel the energy into protecting marginalized groups, including the refugees, to lower their costs of transition."Documenting (also visually) the whole *new* process itself should be useful for detailed analysis of what works and what doesn't, so to improve in next iterations and/or copy in other contexts. 
Hi @Natalia, Hi @Pavlos ! Nice to meet you guys!It's a very interesting example and above all: it feels like the people / farmers / industry / market / government / processes are accepting these kind of changes. Do you believe such initiative could also work in an another contexts? In other words, in which different contexts are you working on? (countries, urban vs rural, etc). Also it was mentioned in the post about looking at the system "from seed to stomach". Wouldn't the whole cycle be "from seed to compost"? And in this sense, are you also focusing into human :-)proteins:-)waste management? 
Lovely to meet you @Pavlos, and welcome to Edgeryders!I look forward to reading more, as Natalia is now paiting us a picture of you doing consultancy in an ambitious way that incorporates incentive systems - targetting those with "access to power and money". That seems different from the other approaches we heard about, for example foodsharing by intentional communities and building grassroots movements - see @Paul_Free's story from Berlin entitled "Gifteconomy". The difference I see (again, look forward to learn more) is that you are looking at this as if you are providing a service for a market, instead of building it bottom up. Does it work for you so far? Can producers and others in the food chain participate at their own initiative or does it depend on someone selecting products for distribution or connection with businesses? 
As we think about Op3n Meetups formats, here are two to consider:1) Action oriented workshops - FeedForward methodology which we can apply by selecting snippets of stories from the online community and connect them with stakeholders in our cities.2) Co-design workshops - the WeMake model documented in the opencare playbook - section How Can I Make a Workshop Happen? (thx @Costantino & WeMake!)
Thank you for sharing this @tamarafuma, and welcome to OpenCare community.I don't know much about FES, but looked it up on wikipedia.Are you using a commercial device (I saw they are pretty expensive at 5-6000 USD) or did you find a cheaper variant? Is there anything community members around here can help with? Let us know if you're looking to learn something specific or just to share your experience, and hopefully we can be useful somehow. 
You guys have a very interesting list of perks for those willing to experience distress, kudos.So you want to raise awareness about serious issues through humor, or a lighthearted approach. I'm guessing there is a difference to be made in approaching awareness this way versus advocating for mental support through humor. For the latter: does (self) irony help embrace the shitiness of one's situation? hm, not sure.
Very simple idea... it could actually work! I don't understand the "city-rally" part, though. Is it gamified? Have you sounded the idea out with bars and cafés yet? 
In our experience, addressing communities works best when you ask them to share stories: experiential data. Asking for opinions or points of view is a bad idea. You get low quality information: half-baked abstractions, ideology, prejudice... we all are most interesting when we share things we have experienced directly. Experience is rich in content and deeply embedded in context. Looking at similar experiences (for example: being hospitalized) from many different points of view drives the "collective" in collective intelligence: the different experiences will combine into a community-validated point of view (for example, it becomes easy to recognize a single experience as an outlier if everyone else had a different experience on something). Consider the following question, taken by @Rossana Torri above: What could be the added value of adopting a “maker/fablab” approach to “reframe” care systems pushing this kind of tools/skills/places into “community-driven” care systems?This is not the kind of question you can directly ask a community. People will immediately go into wishful thinking mode: "we should.." ("bisognerebbe...") and design irrealistic and broken systems that no one can implement. Individual citizens are not especially good at systems design. They are good at data processing. I have explained this at length in my book. You need to ask indirectly, in a way that encourages them to tap into their experience. The equivalent direct question should be something like:Tell us about how you, or people close to you, use a DIY approach to staying healthy or caring for each other.This immediately puts the person into a citizen expert mode. They have already attacked a problem. This will be highly specific ("a visually impaired electronic engineering student needed a way to design electrical circuits, so we did XYZ"). The system level knowledge will be extracted, later, by using ethnography to figure out what concepts, practices, culture etc. connect the different stories. We are ready to assist you writing challenges. 
@Lakomaa could you share with us your research " review of the literature of collective intelligence in care policies"?It could be very interesting for us to have your research as a general framework, to analyze better the main success/key factors.In fact, as you read before, we're thinking as City of Milan, with @Rossana, to create a challenge that could be also an overview about the role of a public actor as a facilitator of open care projects.Let us Know!!ThanksFranca
Following this argument, the “artefacts/services/devices” that WeMake will prototype at the end of the co-design sessions are not the final result of the process. In my mind final results (to be evaluated) are related to the questions listed above.@Rossana Torri so the way I see it is that we can: 1) trust to get answers to these questions when the ethno/ network analysis is done - based on the stories of care that already mention intersections with regulatory systems:Examples "You hear a lot about precarious funding, internal or outside conflicts, political and economic pressure, multitasking, impossible workloads, competition between projects. At the same time, dealing with complex and often rigid political and social institutions, community activists have to become self-trained experts in finances, public relations, lobbying, community-organizing etc. But these fights are long and complex and the institutions and their procedures require a patience that easily outlive the time, the physical and mental resources individuals and grassroots initiatives are able to mobilize." (Prinzessinnengarten, Berlin). Or ​working on a donation basis was my nod to being a non-commercial entity, which (as far as I know) means the clinic is not subject to licensing - similarly to people who volunteer in hospices, addiction recovery centres etc. I am conflicted on this - on the one hand, I recognise that some degree of regulation of healthcare is probably desirable to avoid malpractice and protect patients (Acupuncture clinic in Mortdoor, UK)2) Launch a Challenge specifically on your question: What role for public actors to reframe care systems?Have a look at the 4 challenges so far and let's work on a new one? It can be a description of Welfare di tutti and challenges you have. That would inspire others to open up too. I had a conversation with someone in Milano a few days ago working in healthcare and they were skeptical of sharing issues online because of damaging reputation. Setting a good example would go a loong way and inspire people to be open and constructive! Once the brief intro story is online, we can join forces to reach out specifically to administrations. You could run an internal process in which you ask people to send theirs by email and we upload them in accounts created with their emails and a username they choose. This way you don't ask them to come online from the beginning and come across a scary or weird platform? Let me know, I made the same offer to WeMake team a while ago but no brief... I also asked everyone in the team to share their personal stories of care and use them for engagement instead of linking to opencare.cc or generic pages.. Basically if we want conversations around something we need to start them and set the example. Sorry for the rant :-)
@Tino_Sanandaji great work, this framework is starting to inform a lot the way we think of projects coming in. Two more examples that you might want to dig deeper into:1/ Cytostatic network in 2012-2013 in Romania : community led organised efforts to bring patients unavailable drug treatments and transport them across the borders2/ An acupuncture clinic in Dartmoor UK built as a charity "working on a donation basis was my nod to being a non-commercial entity, which (as far as I know) means the clinic is not subject to licensing - similarly to people who volunteer in hospices, addiction recovery centres etc." (steelweaver)
Hi Alberto, thank you for your comment!The post on FB didn't mention anything, just the travel question. But I saw it was a share from Vlad Voiculescu, so I understood in a second, even if the article that I read in november 2012 did not state his real name. But it was really not hard to connect the dots.So in that evening we spoke for almost one hour on the phone :) , then we met and I took the medcines, that was the first encounter so to speak. Basically, Vlad coordonated the whole thing, he bought the medicines at first, then he found a lot people willing to help with buying, from different cities in Europe and not only.Sometimes Valeriu would pick up people from the airport, sometimes just meet them in Bucharest and took the medicines to the ones in need.I don't know how it was for other cities, but there the distances are smaller and I guess people sorted it out in a similar way.Vlad also made a website: medicamente-lipsa.ro. People could acces it and find the missing drugs and the means to transport them. Not least, a movie was made after the investigation in Hotnews (the website where I read the story in 2012)http://www.hbo.ro/movie/reteaua_-79271You can see it here until september for free http://www.hbogo.ro/content/the-network-1053692950 :)I hope this helps! 
@zoescope just saw your message. See in the Open Care big team folder -> a documentation folder with all notes and materials from Stockholm.
Thanks for the links @Rune, I'm super curious to read the story. As I was reading the translated story of Marco the thing I kept asking myself is : but how do doctors run pre-evaluations and clinical trials for a hacked neuroprosthesis? The best place to upload the story, as I was saying, is going to opencare.cc -> Share your Story.  As for the whole of opencare on this site, to understand how it is designed I recommend reading first our Guide for OpenCare online community. Just a quick issue on the naming: OpenCare is the official name of the EU funded project that we are committed to run as per the proposal. While Op3nCare is also pretty much the same as you will read in the guide, designating the community conversations, the name and materials with this "3" spelling have the advantage of allowing more freedom - for example some participants are not from the European Union per se and may be inhibited if they see "EU research project" all over the website, so having an alternative brand umbrella can help. If you wish, it's a hack to keep the space open.For more technical design issues, I was saying that your user story, bug reporting and suggestions are welcome in the Technical development group. Please bear with the developers as they have a long list of things to fix still :-)
Hey @Noemi, this is just something cultural that people have always been doing in Morocco, it's about going out to catch the cool breeze after a hot summer day and of couse cook together...however there has been a change in the policy in the last couple of years, and it is not allowed to cook in public parks any more even though they use a traditional portable clay pot for coal/making fire and there is no hasard in cooking open air in such way...When people go to the countryside for weekends/holidays, they always take the clay pots to cook their own food in the nature...even though there are restaurants available everywhere. 
Just stumbled upon this social enterprise creating community and business opportunities for migrant women chefs - especially through popup kitchens.Mazi Mas means "with us" in Greek. "In the kitchen we speak the same language" they say.. A beautiful presentation video is here: http://www.mazimas.co.uk/our-story/ 
Wow. Very, very interesting. Evasive, right @Lakomaa ? :-)
As far as I know the reason why you wouldn't see explicit calls for drug transports is because legally you're not allowed to transport but your own. So this is a grey area -people needed to say it's their own if asked at the airport or borders, although technically they couldn't have been arrested on such grounds.. after all they weren't commercializing anything. Even if the s*** hit the fan, no one could publicly dispute this way of getting hold of medicine which was supposed to be provided by the system and covered by the medical insurance! For several years before, Romanians would be procuring citostatics from nearby countries anyway on their own expenses. This is merely a more efficient and structured way of doing the same. Still, the network was semi-legal, meaning it operated under no clear incidence of laws. It's why I remember reading about Vlad in various pseudonyms when the story broke in the media. Similarly, in the movie his face never shows. From looking at the website, it seems the network worked based on collecting forms filled in by patients/family with requests for medicine - it's not clear though how much of the matchmaking was aided by the technology and how much was done manually, through Vlad and his network. Anyhow, most people who were part of it didn't know each other IRL - like Vlad and Valeriu, who were key nodes in the network!@Sabina U, lovely to meet you virtually, and hopefully in person soon!
I would be curious to know if Bengt works alone in his lab, or if he is embedded in a community of like-minded people. Of course, people in the open source movement are by definition relying on communities to make their tools, but my hunch is that there is more community going on here. There's probably a (still tiny) OpenDrop community, that could be as small as 2-3 people (still a huge difference from working alone; and even the quorum sensing stuff is made on the Openwetware wiki, which has 10 contributors. Did Bengt tell you anything about this?
Hi Noemi, it was great talking to you using the online meeting room. It realy gave some insight to the possibilities for 'tele care'.As I told you we are working on a solution for people living with spinal cord injury (http://mecfes.wikispaces.com/)  and I'd like to contribute with a casestory (like issues on transferring the technology into practical/clinical use).  I found out that our  project resonates with the OpenCare project by sharing a similar vision (http://mecfes.wikispaces.com/Mark)  vs. the story of Franko/Hacker comunity-driven care in the EU proposal.However there are some issues with the OpenCare (or is it Op3nCare?) site which I'd like to discuss or understand better.  Would it be the proper place to proceed in this discussion or is there a more appropriate/ preferred way?   
Hi @Rune, this is the story the Milano team are working on, just in case you want to ask anything or keep in touch with developments.
Wow, @Sabina U , what a story. Thanks for sharing. So, it starts with you seeing an update on Facebook. Did your friend mention that they needed someone to take medicines into Bucharest? Or just "somone who travels from Vienna"?Then what? How did you in the Network coordinate? It looks like Valeriu was the one in charge of the final distribution; but how could a person in need of help access the Network? Was there a kind of coordinator (maybe Vlad)?Sorry to ask so many questions, but this is just too interesting.
Heya, is this about the culture of going out or more of a policy or project for bringing people together?
I can only emphasize the importance of shared cooking in communities, it's an essential part of socializing in Marrakech, Morocco where people gather in parks in the evenings and bring their tagine out to cook and mingle while enjoying the cool breeze from the Atlas mountains...
This reminds me of a project The Invisible Labs/Chronically Driven http://theinvisiblelabs.com/news/ and https://medium.com/chronically-driven. A different take on various health issues, and how they make people's lives... better. 
@Noemi Could you share the link?thanks!Zoe
@Pauline @Alex_Levene let me know if you came across scientific studies establishing that link? I couldnt find any..
Personally, but also from the point of view of the institution which I represent in the Opencare consortium (City of Milano), I feel I have not yet found the right "levers" to push people on the platform.  I'm also aware that for this reason we (City of Milan) risk to lose the opportunity to be effective in enriching the online conversation.We tried to do that, through reporting on offline activities, but maybe this is not the best way (too indirect and "scholastic").The fellowships could work well, but maybe we need also different tools, which are capable to affect the quantity and quality of the interactions.As we said this morning, one possibility could be to formulate more precise questions, focusing on different "axes"/actions of OpenCare project. This could maybe help us to “attract” people interested/competent in some specific area of our research/action and catalyse interactions and mutual learning. Does it make sense? Did you take any decision at the end of the workshop?Each partner has its own perspective and one of the challenging aspects of the project is “multiplicity in unit”, as Alberto wrote some days ago. For this I am trying to imagine how we could better position the perspective of each of us within the common frame of OpenCare.If I look at the "local activities" we have developed in Milan during the previous month I would start from these points:- What could be the added value of adopting a “maker/fablab” approach to “reframe” care systems pushing this kind of tools/skills/places into “community-driven” care systems?- Which role can play the public actor?- Which are the favorable conditions (context, type of communities, types of problem/demand of care…) in which this approach can be helpful and generative of innovation?- Other….In my opinion, and adopting the perspective of Ezio Manzini (networks of care), the “fablab concept/approach” that we are following in the “milanese pilot” (which intersects care; skills/education (learning by doing); sustainable development, and surely other things…) could be one of the strategic assets within a broader ecosystem where more actors are included and play different roles (citizens as care recipients and care-givers, administrations, public health institutions and professionals, no profit organization and so on…).Following this argument, the “artefacts/services/devices” that WeMake will prototype at the end of the co-design sessions are not the final result of the process. In my mind final results (to be evaluated) are related to the questions listed above.“Communities” (and here I have in mind: something that is not “families”, not individuals, but people linked by a common interest/purpose; so I would say "elective comunities") are the propulsive force and nodes of the ecosystem. People act together as they are moved by a common challenge (not “need” if you don’t like the term) which is not answered by traditional/closed systems.Platforms (not only digital, but maybe also physical) could help to organize and improve the ecosystem (I’ll come back to this point using the example of “Welfare di tutti” in Milan). Thanks to Ezio and to all of you for the challenging discussion!...and sorry for the amount of errors that you will find in this text.I'm going from one plane to another and I have no time for check :-)Rossana
Great project, thank you for sharing. It's beyond me to see how the city can ever give up on ideas which work or generate enthusiasm.You'd think the smaller the city, the easier to make this kind of change and keep it going. I see how consistent my hometown is becoming when it comes to legitimizing its caretakers and picking up on good ideas (gave the example of the hammocks in the park which became legit).@ChristineOehme I don't know if you've teamed up with @Moriel who is also doing work on disability, but she has been asking "Is it the disability itself, that disables people? Or is it the attitude and perception of the society and a non-barrier-free environment which actually disables?"From your post this question is less important because at the end of the day, the problem is how to enable Fabian and others to enjoy play like any kid should. So while disability is indeed a gradient (we are all disabled at something or at some point!) and needs a change in perception, it is actions (building inclusive playgrounds) that really hit the nail on the head. At least this is how I see it.
I follow your work from a distance with great interest. I think you will soon run into an issue of determination. What I mean by this is: the simplest the "device", the more the ways in which it can be used, the broader the range of abilities it accommodates. Take, for example, plasticine:You can do all sorts of stuff with it, from just playfully messing around to veritable art. So, in a way it is perfectly inclusive. But if you ever tried to play with plasticine with someone else, you know that disabilities are by no means the only important differentiator: children of different ages, for example, will want to do different things with plasticine. Everyone likes it (it is accessible for everyone), but it does not necessarily bring people together. It appears that accessibility does not lead per se to socialization.Your response might be to design in such a way as to restrict the ways to interact with the artefact. For example, there are not many things you can do with a merry-go-round (though children do try!). But then, you risk overdetermining the interaction, making your work uninteresting for everyone! Hmm, interesting problem! Looking forward to your next moves.
Also ping:@Massimo@Rossana Torri@melancon
"Inclusion and accessibility are two different topics/areas". This is a really interesting intuition.But... you forgot the picture! You can edit the challenge response to add it. 
Wow, @ChristineOehme, this is really valuable material. Great work. The end of your post suggests Fabian (and others – many others, in fact) could benefit from customized playgrounds. This is not so difficult, as there are corners of the makers community that are both interested in it and able to do it. Controprogetto in Milano, for example, have at least once involved locals in a city called Taranto to design and build a whole (temporary) playground in the city center. The video is super-inspiring! The final 40 seconds or so of the video are an act of accusation to the municipality, which did not follow up on the work done and let the participatory work rot away. I guess this is another case for stewardship, a favourite topic in Edgeryders. 
Years ago I came across this hilarious and frustrating game:"Brainball is a two-player game where relaxation is counterbalanced with the desire to win. The little ball on the game's table is telekinetically controlled through the use of each player's brainwaves. Both a calm state and a stressed state have a direct influence on the match. The player who is most passive can watch the ball roll away towards the opponent's goal and a prospective win."Slate wrote an article about it a while back: Bowling with Brainwaves
I came across this article about a competition in South Korea where people do, well, nothing and immediately thought of this conversation thread..."Since the first competition was held two years ago, it's evolved into a full-on pageant with a panel of judges and a set of strict rules—no phones, no talking, no checking your watch, no dozing off. WoopsYang said more than 2,000 people signed up for the 70 contestant slots this year, and she had to hold qualifying rounds to select the best candidates."Full article available here: http://www.vice.com/read/doing-nothing-has-become-a-sport-in-south-korea
The city of Lecce launched a hackathon with students, hackers and wheelchair-bound individuals to collaboratively map barriers to individuals in town (story, in Italian).The approach is slightly different from that of Wheelmap. Wheelmap assigns a tag to a single point:"wheelchair" = "no"Whereas they actually mapped objects using OSM Tracker, for example traffic light poles, and added codes to them according to the impact they had on mobility. So, accessibility relates to objects ("nodes" or "ways") in OpenStreetMap rather than to coordinates. The results are stored as a layer in a CSV file on the city's open data portal and linked to OpenStreetMap via Umap. Maps are generated by dynamically superimposing OSM and the accessibility layer: http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/it/map/lecce-luoghi-accessibili-per-disabilita-varie-e-di_20512#15/40.3509/18.1826 This was done by the wonderful @piersoft and fellow citizens.  
You can find the map on www.wheelmap.org.The wheelmap is a map for wheelchair accessible places. You can find places, evaluate places you have already been to, or inscribe places. The map shall help people in wheelchairs or with other mobility limitations to plan their day easier.When I met Raul Krauthausen for an interview, we looked for a place on the wheelchair, that fits us both: based on the location and the accessibility. 
@Costantino available and present. @melancon- what is the deadline to submit our challange to the participants? - can you link a tipical call / challenge ? 
.. (call it what you want) is that it makes it easier to see how/ if it would translate to other groups or settings. What we don't know about the ER style of do-ocracy yet is how it would work in a real life, physical place that is not an infinite playground or resource after all - that's why I asked @marcoclausen about ruling over the vegetable beds.Shouldn't a community that is healthy be better at caring for its members than one where conflicts take over? (with the shades of grey in between of couse - happiness and conflict are no absolutes). If so, then learning to minimise conflict or other kinds of distress should make it easier for activists to stay well. On learning: we're all doing that, but no matter how much you learn, if you can't keep the lights on with people staying well, then it's only a matter of time.. As an example, a paintbrush factory-turned-contemporary art space where I'm from in Cluj saw a huge blow after 7 years - one of the splitting factions has trademarked the brand with EU's OHIM, and anyone in the art community is now somewhat part of that conflict. The brand is affected, reputations too, and of course the influence achieved over the years and ability to attract funding might be too.. I'm sure there's many stories like that out there. Anyway, just a thought. thanks again for the piece :-)
I have decided to put here my "homework". My favourite OpenCare story is still the first one: Greece's shadow health care system. I see a strong similiarity with the cytostatic network story in Romania, though I know less of it. No point discussing why these are care stories, that's self-evident. It makes more sense to discuss why they are open.They are open in the trivial sense that they are not constructed on intellectual property rights.They are open in the sense that people can freely decide to step in and become a part of it. There is not even a real vetting process: the Helliniko clinic works by asking people to volunteer for a group, so that which individuals are paired with which group is driven by self selection. As for the cytostatic network, I guess that came down to people phoning up and saying "hey, I'm flying to Bucharest next week, do you want me to carry anything?". Implication: the people who are most likely to step in are the people who themselves need to use the system. The community serves itself.They are open in the sense that coordination and management processes are relatively fluid. People coordinate using minimal tech and whatever works (Google Groups in the case of Helliniko). This is in stark contrast to, for example, Airbnb or Uber, where every user and every provider interact in exactly the same ways, and these ways are encoded in the affordances of the respective platforms.Maybe they are also open in the sense that the range of what gets done (or doesn't) is not written in stone, but emerges as a function of opportunity, motivation of people on the ground and perceived need. For example, Helliniko does not do the same things a hospital does: it does not do surgery, and it has no beds – it does less than hospitals here, because covering this need would increase complexity by an order of magnitude. Neither does it do first aid, because Greeks have a right to first aid even if they are long-term unemployed. On the other hand, Helliniko hands out free pharmaceuticals and even non-medical stuff like baby formula or food for (poor) people with food intolerances. So they do more than hospitals here. When all is said and done, everything in these stories is constantly renegotiated: the means, the teams, the actions. Except one thing: the people being served. In the Helliniko story, this is the local folks who have lost access to public health care. In the cytostatic network, it's cancer patients and their families, who cannot get hold of certain pharmaceuticals. The service is built around their needs. Finally: these two stories are exemplar also in the sense that they can use small contibutions, like Wikipedia (as argued here). You can help Helliniko even just putting word out on social media when the clinic needs a certain medicine, or the cytostatic network just by puntting a couple of boxes of medicines into your suitcase when flying to Romania. This does not make them more open, but it does make them better at taking advantage of being open. 
Agree on all fronts, @marcoclausen . After three years of do-ocracy in Edgeryders, we are not blind to its flaws. It comes down to the lesser evil, I guess. It kind of works with us, but I would definitely not try to implement it at the nation-state level, at least not without major major revision! However, do-ocracy is itself a set of rules. I like to think of it in terms of Protocol, a word that we used a lot when working on the unMonastery: https://edgeryders.eu/en/unmonastery/protocol-01-engineering-human-to-human-interaction-forI am familiar with Graber's work, and, like you, I enjoyed it too. 
It looks like Raul is advocating the removal of special categories ("labels") tagging underprivileged people. This means giving up our standard way of seeing the world by categories  that have administrative and legal relevance ("grids" in the language of James Scott).  It seems to be a letimotiv in OpenCare. I do see the potential for lock-in when administrative grids become involved. You get organisations that "own a problem": my organisation deals with blind people, yours with teenage pregnancies etc. As long as these categories have currency in the policy document and in the strategies of donors, the organisations serving them will prosper.  What I don't see is why label removal should be so hard intellectually. We have something we can replace categories with: frequency distributions. Instead of saying "we need to accommodate the disabled" we can say "3% of humans cannot go up more than one step, and the step needs to be lower than 200 millimeters". They can be disabled, but also simply old, or exhausted, or drunk. This is irrelevant. What's relevant is that it's just plain stupid to design a building that will not work every time! This is the classic Darwinian move. Linnean biology tried to characterize a species by characterics: birds have beaks, pelicans have very large beaks, humans walk on two legs... wait, that would mean Raul is not human, since he does not walk. But neither is he a fish, though he presumably can swim. So what do we do? Do we make him his own species? Darwin said "look, a species is simply a frequency distribution across certain characteristics. For example, most ants do not have wings, but some (males) do. About 98% (I'm making the number up here) of humans walk on two legs, but a 2% does not." The frequency distribution captures all the information a designer needs. What's so hard about using it?
Dear Alberto,thanks for the reply. i totally understand the wish do not get mixed up with organizational structures. and even though i don't like the word "governance" too much, i think for a long term survivale of projects, and also to keep them transparent and open, there should be next to the possibility to do also some general rules and mechanism. i also refer here to the idea of the commons, that are often practically related to very clear rules (including sanctions, and instruments to deal with conflict). I think Jo Freemans "the tyranny of structurelessness" (http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) is still - after 40 years -  relevant, and i also enjoyed reading David Graebers "Utopia of Rules" where he also refers to Freeman.  
Hi @Noemi and thank you for your input.At the moment i think Live hangout might do fine, or...do you have any suggestion?About the date...could be by the end of the month, like monday 27 for instance..Next week i will schedule it better.Hope to get feedback and some interest about these issues..
thanks noemi for your feedback. it's hard to give advice on the right governance structure and conflict management. in a project like ours it's still an ongoing learning or de-learning process, especially dealing with formal and informal mechanism and forms of communication and decision making. 
Excellent piece @marcoclausen . It resonates with other stories and opinion I have heard, especially in the context on the unMonastery: many so-called social innovation initiatives (including, er, Edgeryders itself) are constantly at risk of burning out the (relatively) few people who pull most of the weight. Noemi above seems to endorse governance as a way to mitigate friction. My point of view is that governance often is an attention sink, and could potentially make burnout worse. This is why we are so interested in do-ocracy as a way of life: it has low overhead. On the other hand, I could not agree more on collective learning. Our own version of that is an emphasis on documentation, so that people have a shared, written, searchable and evolving knowledge base. I think this is working quite well for us. 
I'm in and looking forward to it. Added the location in the event text and NB: time is 9 - 11 30 CET.Our site timezones don't work.. (for some reason on my screen I see 8 00 -10 30 CET).Sharing here for the meeting purposes some stories for people to read, just in case you don't know how to choose:Open Science- and TechnologiesCare by communities: Greece's shadow zero-cash health care systemCommunity Acupuncture - an ongoing mutation"Coeur d'Or": collaborative efforts for promotional and preventive cardiovascular care in West-AfricaHow do different food cultures facilitate care?A new chapter in Other People's Story BooksOn being a self-entrepreneurCollaborative care. A new generation of servicesDesign for vulnerability
@Moriel what an insightful interview!Fyi I was surfing the net and saw that Berlin received the Access City award from the EC in 2013 for removing barriers to disability, especially in urban planning and transportation. Surely public policies don't solve it, as Raul is saying, yet there is something about designing for the public space. It's interesting because it's so diverse - it's more neutral, and hosts encounters of all sorts of people. Just a thought.
Ping @markomanka maybe he's interested or can connect us to someone?Also, Federico you might want to check if @jdossou80@yahoo.com's project of community mobilizing and raising awareness around cardiovascular diseases might be suited to cover at least part of the webinar.Count me in for helping prepare it. Do you have a preferred tech for event delivery? 
Great money quote, thank you so much @marcoclausen for sharing this story.I'm curious, how did you learn to deal with conflicts as your network expanded so much over the years? Do you have a governance structure in place that helps you work out solutions inside the community: for example if there are differences of opinions between gardeners, beekeepers, neighborhood conveners, the association members and various groups stewarding Prinzessinnengarten. After all, you only have a limited number of vegetable beds, right?
We should settle this during the June meeting.I am assuming those who showed interest still do. @Noemi and @Nadia and @Alberto and @CostantinoWhat we need to decide iswho of us would give a short presentation of what is opencare (and how/why it intersects with the hacking event)what challenge we can submit to participants (something tech-oriented with a WeMake flavor, or one with a UBx flavor or both)
I'm seeking contributions, participants and co-organizers for a webinar at the end of the month about discussing on e-patients and online communities on healthcare issues and forms of activism, networking and engagement of patients, citizens, makers, etc.. in research and social shaping of medical and healthcare technology. Anyone interested is welcome in co-designing or sketching the best formula for such a live event!Thank you
Hi Laura,I had managed to miss this as we were in deep preparation mode ahead of launching OpenCare. Are you up for trying something else? I have two suggestions to make1) Repost the material from the kickstarter campaign in your post above (if you like I can do it for you). This will make it more appealing for an Op3n fellowship2) I am just about to start pursuing a number of fundraising avenues including fellowships to support my own experimental work. We can collaborate on this if you like? 
Daer @Noemi thank you for your comment, yes it is reallly big problem about visually impaird people here in Armenia, and in general Caucasus reginon, about unemployement statistic։ we have official numberս but in Armenian languge...here is some source about visually impaied pphttps://www.armenianow.com/society/health/50049/armenia_health_blind_eye_specialist
.. looks like a very thorough work!It's incredible that none of these people seems to be cooks, and yet they are so knowledgeable about what cooking brings to one's life - and how that's a part of living a good, peaceful life.   
Hey everyone,thanks for your thoughts! The idea of an "interactive camp" whithout the usual hirachies seems like a very interesting alternative. We are staying in contact now with the people from ROC 21. They are working on new and better structures for refugee camps. Because its important not to separate the different "problems" from each other but to organize the camp differently from the very first:"We will realize a dynamic and open space of opportunity, growth and co-creation. Everything will be developed participatively, combining the knowledge and cultural needs of refugees and the local population alike. Activating our diverse network of architects, facilitators, academics, designers and social innovators, we will draft a modern and sustainable set of interven- tions that can be combined according to the given needs."and as it happens they are trying it right now here in Berlin! we are going to meet next week, I will report! (check them out here: http://www.roc21.net)The idea of using the the knowledge, the creativity that is already in the camp as the source to teach and learn is really nice. But I do get Noemis point that the people in the camps, (which are intended to be short term), probably wont be too motivated to start a big project, because actually they hope they can move to a better place as soon as possible. But in fact people are having a lot of time! and they are really bored. But also very very worried. That must be a horrible state of mind. What can we do with it? The experience in the camp where we were building stuff all together, was really nice because we were doing something with our hands and totally forgot the situation around us.  
Kitchens are kind of high-tech as home environments go. To function, they need powerful and potentially dangerous things like electricity, fire, and sharp blades. In some administrative cultures (Italy, for sure) camp administrators might feel more at ease if their "guests" are not allowed near them. Yet another case in which liability issues contribute to render people powerless. @Alex Levene documented several community kitchens in The Jungle. This seems to be a pattern. I think you are onto something, @Luisa !
Thank you @Noemi for this super interesting project link!
Thanks for sharing this with us @Luisa. I was convinced of this approach ever since I heard Jeff, a community member in Athens telling us about Senait's Kitchen to actually provide employment for migrants - a little like a company shell. In a year they've gone through several iterations, bringing new migrants in the group of cooks, have catered to hundreds and are on their way of building a cooperative. Check out Options Foodlab: http://options.limited/about-options/
Alex and Tomma can of course give you a more informed view, but on the top of my head I ask myself what goes in the mind of someone who landed there and expects this to be temporary and short, only to see that days go by and turn into months. Volunteering is predicated on some sort of idle capacity - but would those trapped perceive that they have that time? with being busy to figure out their own situation and wanting to escape it.. (Alex makes the point of difficulty to engage here - fyi I very much liked the idea of going through community leaders to see what possiblilities are worth trying or not). 
Hi there, i'm following this interesting discussion. I wonder if making possibile for the people inside the camp to be trained to welcome coming refugees (e.g.: moms helping with the arrival of next mothers in terms of understanding the needs, welcoming mothers, showing them around the camp and the area, taking contacts with the staff) and let them re-configure the camp as a collective action taken by the guests themselves to welcome better new refugees might help to overgo frustration and lack of communication. Having a daily goal -especially a shared one- might help and leaving one day the camp knowing that you did a part to make a better place of it would turn a "senseless part of my life" in a good memory of commitment and engagement.
I am trying to interest the EC's Policy Innovation Unit in the idea of a "self-organized camp", based on the intuition by @Alex Levene – and now this confirmation by @Tomma and others. But, I am not holding my breath. I will keep you guys posted. 
A few links to websites (mostly from reputable/establishment sources in the UK/US) that offer links between physical excercise and improvements to mental health and wellbeing:https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/p/physical-activity-and-mental-healthhttp://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/treatmentswellbeing/physicalactivity.aspxhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/exercise.aspx
Hi Tomma, You final comment here about wanting people to feel confident engaging not just in the 'safe space' but also in te wider world is something that i have been thinking a lot about.I frequently have conversations about the idea of 'agency' (in the sense of action or power) within the refugee community as so many of the relationships i see created and perpetuated are unnecessarily heirarchical (e.g. we give, you take/ we teach, you learn)Creating solutions that don't treat displaced people like children is really important to me. I look forward to hearing what happens next for your project.Alex
Everyone, thank you for your support! @Alberto, yes it makes total sense to get into the regulations and we are on it. Right now it looks like our project is more and more shifting to the not “commercial” side. There is already a big need just for cooking opportunities. @Yannick I like the idea of collecting the successful examples. With @Nadia we talked about a possible meeting with all the parties involved. A meeting where we would bring the people we got to know while researching in the last weeks and some law expert together. We think it would be very nice to give them the opportunity to directly talk and find out about the things, which matter most to them. Though we would prefer an informal atmosphere to allow a secure feeling for everyone. This really is important to them! That is why we do not want to invite someone from the “parks and open spaces department” at least not officially. We found out that they are the responsible ones here in Berlin. We already tried to find someone from a citizen initiative or from our broader circle of friends, but so far could not manage. By any chance do you have any idea whom we could ask? What do you think about formal vs. informal?
I don't know which of the three solutions proposed by the community in the co-design workshops won and will be prototyped, but this seems like widely useful and needed.Let's hope it won't be too advanced in what it can do :-) and risk something like with the baby monitors - they were first simple audio devices with a clear functionality and now they're IoT machines or what not, prone to hacking and violating privacy.Curious, will the people who have already participated in the initial phase be involved in the actual prototyping? 
Hi @Alberto,Thank you for your interests and sorry for the late reply. Unfortunately, I am not too familiar with this area. All the information I have came from the news and stories I hear. I don't recall if I have heard punitive damage in China but I will take a look at it. With the little knowledge I have, and the experience of living in both China and the US for a long time, the impression--probably not accurate-- that I have on the health system in two countries is that in the States most problems are related to the high expense. Health insurance is expensive, calling an ambulance is expensive, there is always a long waiting in the hospital, and including what you mentioned--actions not being done to avoid suing. While in China, many problems are associated with lack of law enforcements and disrespect between people. I will let you know if I find anything interesting. 
Hi @Noemi,Yes, I am working on the same project with @Moriel, @ChristineOehme and @Luise Kröning. Thank you very much for your feedback. We will take a look at their project. 
"Disabled people need barrier-free environments, acceptance, suitable language and connection."Hey, I need those things too. Everyone does. So:"Disabled people need barrier-free environments, acceptance, suitable language and connection."It comes down to making sure you do not build barriers by assuming some kind of norm. The norm is the barrier.
There are also other stories in the same context of Milan codesign sessions https://edgeryders.eu/en/fatti-pi-in-l-or-step-aside, https://edgeryders.eu/en/in-p 
Hi Luise ( plus Moriel, Christine and Lujia),I saw from Susa that everyone has made great progress on their projects :) You may want to check out the work that @Moushira posted about   here plus comments: https://edgeryders.eu/en/step-up 
I read this and was reminded of the conversation with  @moriel, @lujia, @ChristineOehme and @Luise Kröning about their product design project after this  interview with Raul Krauthausen. They are taking a different approach in asking how to create environments which are    inclusive by design and not by label.Someone mentioned a website with a map of the city as seen from perspective of someone who has to navigate it with wheelchair: where there are no-go zones etc. Insight: many barriers are completely invisible to anyone not affected by them. They proposed some design intervention towards making barriers in a decentralised manner visible as a first step. My opinion: making barriers visible is great when you also have the means to do something about it then and there without too much effort. Like a workaround where you can put something in place to make a staircase accessible etc. Without having to rely on the city or the architect or whatever to get involved. This allows us to live out our better selves, rather than be guilted for yet another thing that someone else failed to do on our behalf. Or wait for change that never comes.My two cents.
@lujia hi! Are you working with @Moriel on this?You might want to get in touch with members in Milano for a slightly different problem and approach - they zoomed in on the problem of wheelchair mobility and how disabled people can't push their own wheelchairs and be on their own. Better designed wheelchairs would ideally increase one's autonomy and freedom to move. It takes out of the equation the need to be accompanied at any step, which is after all a practical reality identified by the group in discussions and something which can affect how others treat you.  It would be interesting to study how perspective differ - what goes on in people's heads when they see someone helped versus when they see someone being on their own. Not sure how much it ties with your (more educational) approach, but as a learning point here's the idea where you can get in touch for more info.
At the end of january, the STOA (Science & Technology Office Assessment of the European Parliament) hosted a workshop about the study of the "Impact and Potential of collaborative Internet and additive manufacturing technologies". There are many clues and references about 3D printing development, trends in the field of education and healthcare. The possible scenarios are depicted thanks to a DELPHI-like study involving experts from all over Europe.  The full study on The Collaborative Economy is available in english.@Noemi  @Costantino   @Alberto
Hi Noemi, you make an important point, and it's something that we've been struggling a little bit with in our project. Everyone will most probably face some form of emotional stress at one point in their lives. These reflections were related to us trying to narrow down our target group and the issue we want to focus on. As we found a particular lot of these issues popping up in our immediate surrounding during our interviews, we were thinking to focus on young creatives. However, we are not quite sure if this even makes sense and Edgeryders is the right context to explore this or if we should approach the topic of mental health in a different way. Lots to figure out! Of course, all input is very much appreciated! 
Hi Alex,thank you for saying thank you! :) take all the time you need 
Hi Patrick, nice to meet you and thank you so much for sharing your brothers story! "I think modern life makes it very hard for such people and you need to try to find ways to live on the edge, and places to escape." Do you know of any good projects like that? Something like the Unmonastery perhaps, or are you thinking of something different? 
Thank you for your comment @NoemiI'm not teaching about healthcare issues, but running a project about innovation with Education Technologies and CSCL adopting the University e-Learning site and coding by html around some github pages as you can see..Unfortunately the  community interactions are the goal and not the mean. I'm doing my best to inspire students to share and collaborate online. From the social page you can ask to join the facebook group and DIIGO social bookmarking community; i will let in anybody asking for access. Other few e-tivities are run on the e-learning site, but the access is only for students and tutors of the campus.The idea to run together some webinars seems great to me! In the AGENDA you find the (flexible) schedule about webinars; we might swap the listed issues, or just pick out some of them. I'd love to share ideas about such issues with anybody. We could arrange sessions in english too..and seen the interest for online ethnography have some meetings too to discuss about methods, studies and experiences.  What about starting in June talking about "e-patients and EHMs"? That would be heaven! Usually i use a doodle survey to choose date and hour, livehangout for the videosession, archived on youtube then by a playlist.
@MariamDilbandyan, nice to read you and welcome again (I had messaged you last week). Thanks for this, it seems you're on a great track. Your intuition of the client market seems about right, as physical wellbeing is increasingly important to techies and hackers.I looked up the employemnt stats because I wondered if you meant 25 per cent of all the impaired, instead of 25 in absolute. Couldn't find it, and found different numbers (total 25K impaired people), but this only testifies to the scale of the problem. I also came across another initiative called Culture House of the Blinds, which you probably know of already.Paging here @Moriel and their group in Berlin looking for inspiring approaches to design for generalized disability, not even using the word "disabled" in order to eliminate the stigma.
Hi again @Federico Monaco, wow it struck me to see similarities in our approaches - the open approach to community learning in particular, and the focus on process. It seems you're more interested in teaching students collaborative practices than growing their knowledge of healthcare, which should follow naturally as an outcome (by the way do you measure that in any way?).I have looked for the community interactions but the only space I found was this one (empty?) https://puntozero.github.io/community.html Should I go somewhere else?One last point for now, your timeline follows closely OpenCare as well. Is it possible for non-registered students to participate in the webinars? If so, we might consider partnering up - as many community members here speak Italian and could be interested to join.
In realtà il mio timore è che tale esposizione risultasse davvero troppo fantasiosa, utopica, ed un pochino "fuffosa".Questo è perà ciò che penso realmente, nonostante poi la vita dispensi indicazioni e "risultati" di tutt'altro indirizzo e spessore.
Per il momento, considerando tutta una serie di difficoltà "logistiche", è mio desiderio misurarmi fattivamente sull'idea che decideremo il prossimo Mercoledì 1 Giugno a WeMake, nel corso della terza sessione di co-design del Progetto.Tuttavia, poiché l'appetito vien mangiando, non escludo di cimentarmi in futuro su idee e progetti ben più "personali" ...includendo la super wheelchair interattiva! :-)Replicando brevemente sul tema del cammino interiore, confesso di essere altrettanto sopreso e contento di come un lungo percorso "sotterraneo" - carsico - abbia trovato uno sbocco in modo così semplice e naturale. Evidentemente il coinvolgimento in un progetto di confronto e condivisione costituisce una vera e propria tecnica "clinica riabilitativa" per le nostre vite, troppo abituate a restare oggetto di valutazione - e di dispute - da parte di altri.
Guess Germans want to spend the little freetime they have without getting stressed about more appointments. They just want to do what they feel like in that moment. If somebody wants to join spontaniously that´s fine.We are in touch with the people from let´sintegrate and are willing to extend their program on a less obligative way but to rise out of a situation.Thank´s for your comment!Marie
E' molto interessante e conciso ciò che scrivi, soprattutto quanto segue: "una via percorribile, questo è il presupposto e nel contempo l'obiettivo del Progetto, che deve sicuramente sorprendere, sollecitare e coinvolgere soprattutto il “mondo” del bisogno, oltre a quello istituzionale ed economico sociale, per garantire un terreno “di coltura” favorevole all'avvio di iniziative e progetti che naturalmente rispettino l'integrità delle persone e delle loro legittime aspettative, che debitamente tengano conto del supporto e dell'impegno della collettività e che ne garantiscano l'azione solidale attraverso le buone pratiche di indirizzo e di governo locale, nazionale e transnazionale."Grazie @Francesco Maria ZAVA 
Hi @MarieScheurer !  I find that the proposition (for Germans) can make a difference: when you are asked to come and commit to do something and be responsible for it is different than when you are asked to join a social gathering, or simply have fun. A proposition I loved was the one by Tonguesten (here on Edgeryders) - who are mixing language with culture, and frame it as being part of a community of language learners.Any idea of why they are reluctant and don't want to feel obligated?
Where I come from a funny thing is happening: everyone loves festivals, especially during this time of the year, May-June before students are out of town for holidays. We had very strict regulations about sitting on the grass in our central park, you know that kind of green space where you really want to spend time in nature but can't because it's too cosmeticized? Nowadays there's Jazz in the Park and the Big Hammock Day and these kinds of events which start as one offs but then create a demand and become a habit. What they have in common is that they start with a big push.
Whaaa that would be a dream, but in Brussels for 'safety reasons' we can't BBQ in any park in the region, i'm really thinking about how to change that, but we are not enough. At this moment the open air pools is finally a worth a debat, so we concentrate on that. We don't have any open air pool in Brussels either :(
Thanks. It's not just you, I had read your Amish related post and at the time was just working on this one on my own. So clearly there is something there about tightly knit communities making decisions together and planning thoroughly their care system - investments and returns.As to the cytostatics, you're right - I will ask Vlad and common friends to make a connection and take it from there. Of course, establishing causal links between someone setting up a massively effective thing like this network or the Greek clinic and their recruitment into politics is more complex. As far as I know Vlad is also VP in the European Cancer Patient Coalition and organises an annual camp for children diagnosed with cancer. So there are credentials backing up his current position.
@Noemi, this is probably your best post yet. You knocked me right out there. I need to think more about your questions in bold. It seems you have in mind an Amish-like solution – or is it me being under the influence of that article?But I do know this: OpenCare needs to know more about the Cytostatic Network. I appreciate your friend Vlad is "busy", but I am sure you can dig out someone who was in the front line of the Network. That's an OpenCare Fellowship right there.Maria, the woman in the Helliniko Community Clinic, told us that the doctor who started the original community clinic (the one in Rhodhes) had just been appointed minister in the reshuffled Tsipras administration at the time of our visit there (October 2015). If this is a pattern, it's a very interesting one. How about getting in touch and offering to partner up for an event on open care in Bucharest? I'm completely improvising, but... open care bootcamp? Showcasing this sort of "shadow govt innovation"?
Let's try on Monday then.Ruxandra
.. well @Pauline and @lujia, you might be interested in Eastern European care as well - I just published some of my own experiences here.
Seriously? In Italy BBQs in the park are big – well, in Milano at least, now that I think of it I never saw it done in Emilia Romagna. I think the fad was started by the Peruvian community, who moved in in force. There are even web pages on "the best parks to do BBQ in Milan", or Rome, or whatever: http://www.viaggiamo.it/parchi-dove-fare-grigliate-a-milano/This is fairly typical: 
I love this idea, and it would be interesting to see it develope in multiple cities around europe. Berlin is lucky for one part: you have bbq zones a bit everywhere. There can be a lot shared through BBQ and i saw it when i visited Berlin that all kind of social classes use it and make it feel lik, e home. This is important. Problem for cities in europe is that they aren't designed to have multifunctional public spaces. It is starting to shift, but it is still a long way to go. in Brussels for exemple you can't BBQ anywhere but in your garden, that makes it difficult because gardens are becoming something more rare when people are starting to live in smaller and smaller spaces. So yes there needs to be a new regulation. I know for Brussels what could help is people hacking the system in big number, the legislation almost always follows up then. But you have to know how to play media and politics before, so it isn't easy for newcomers to have that background. Having a guide of succesful tests could be usefull yes. You could develop A Taste Of Home as a platform for those experiments anywhere in Europe, and if communicated well people will use it as a guide. And legislation will see, if succesful, that there is an urge in their space to work around that! Good luck with the project and keep us up to date!
Works for you?
Hi Nadia,yes definitely we can have a skype call late morning on Friday if that is ok with you. Just ping me on skype. Ruxandra
Yes, I think that is why we started using the term "newcomers" in our group as well when we first heard about it and you are absolutely right, that some of those "newcomers" are already having strong cultural claims to a space. It was during the interviews we did when we first came along this paradox. I will put up another post on our complete research development and include this observation there as well. Thank you for your help!
I appreciate its message to companies, makes it clear and quite convincing.Actually "newcomers" is the most generic, broad enough and also non-offensive term we came up with for this OpenCare challenge. It turns out that most of us have fit that category at some time in our lives. I only wanted to point out that projects looking at integration of sorts might need to acknowledge that those who are perceived as newcomers can already have strong cultural claims to a space because they are already shaping it e.g. working migrants, or foreign students settling to a space. And so even this generous term falls short. Will keep thinking about this. 
@Noemi yes, I think you are right! It would make total sense. We had a guest from HiMate last week at university. I think they build up their platform being such a diverse group from the beginning on. It is a free voucher platform for refugees, similar to Groupon. Maybe interesting for you? Nadia was at the meeting as well. About the indeed generic term "newcomers", do you have any suggestion what else to use?
Ping @Ruxandra do you have time for a chat about this in the next few days? I think it may be time to look into this in the context of care. @Susa and I are running Hacking Utopia, a studio course on product design for social and demographic change at UDK. (it's tied to the OpenCare project). They're currently coming out of the research phase in which they have been guided through a process of identifying and understanding where they could make meaningful design interventions (products and or services). Today they're going to summarise what they have learned and what they want to build (I'll post documentation online here later). Next they will be actually designing the products and I think the process above could be very helpful. Would you be up for joining a skype call where we help them to think through the business modelling/sustainability design for their products?
Well done, @Luisa and all. I like how you narrowed a generic problem down to a specific one (integrate the interactive food customs / traditions). It may be harder than just writing a step-by-step guide to starting a street food activity and translating it into several languages. I do not know Germany well, but in Italy the regulatory landscape is a lot tighter than what seems to go for Asian markets (eg Thailand). The moment you start serving food to the public, you need to comply with licensing, safety, hygiene regulations. Additionally, many market operate a fixed number of stalls: you cannot just add a food cart as you would in other parts of the world. All of this increases the fixed costs of starting an activity. Every year, as the summer comes and festival season kicks in, the police braces to fight off illegal hawkers (who are, for the most part, just people trying to make a living, many of them migrants). The legal ones are very vocal in demanding that the police shuts down their competitors on fairness grounds ("we have to comply with all these expensive regulations, whereas these guys just go gray economy"). In passing: within Europe there are already subastantial regulatory differences. I live in Belgium, and here tiny restaurants with toilets in the basements, that you access through narrow and steep stairs, are very common. In Italy they would all be illegal: restaurants need to have wheelchair-friendly facilities, fire exits whose number and width depend on venue capacity, and so on. By my own guesstimate, about half of the restaurants in Brussels would have to shut down if the Italian regulation were ported to Belgium. So, I guess a first step towards A Taste of Home is mapping out the regulation, and trying to figure out what the minimum investment needed to start a small food related activity would be. Makes sense?
@Luisa, just a quick thought: maybe Welcome Dinner is more popular with locals than newcomers because of the way the team is configured - mostly locals I'm guessing? If "newcomers" (generic term because newcomers might have been around for some time now!) were actually part of the design and the project team they'd have new insights into how more diverse communities can be engaged. This is exactly what we're looking at with OpenCare - novel ways of improving promising projects out there, even if these new ways are just insights or if it means borrowing ideas from different projects faring better already.  
This thread is part of an effort of arriving at the right questions to reveal new knowledge: knowledge of approaches, of projects out there, of ways that work and dont in terms of support (more than fixes). If we manage to draw in different people some of whom have experiential knowledge with projects you mention @johncoate, even better. If some of the people joining the conversation are running an initiative and they can improve it on the basis of that new knowledge, even better. if we, together, decide to take on new avenues as a continuation of the conversation (an OpenCare spinoff?), well that is the most outcome to come out, so who knows..
Hey everyone! Thank you so much for commenting and taking part in this conversation. I just recently noticed how many people replied. A huge sorry for not having written back any earlier! Alberto, I like the story of your party very much. Even though this was the question I started with, at the moment I or better we, because we started working as a group, are more focused on the relation between the use of public space, food culture and the feeling of home when it comes to people on the move. I will open another post for those interested. So sorry again and it will not happen again!
Hey Noemi,A huge thank you for your fast respond and an even bigger sorry for not having written back any earlier!  It was just recently that I noticed that you and so many other people had commented on this. My bad and it will not happen again. Sorry! I had a look at Dine With Us and liked it a lot. Thank you for the link! It is a bit similar to Welcome Dinner in Berlin where I have already signed up couple of weeks ago but am still waiting for a match. There are a lot more locals interested or at least signing up for it at the moment than newcomers – maybe due to the flyer-bans in Berlin’s refugee camps?  If I get a match I will tell you about the experience.About your practical experience I have pretty much experienced the same thing so far. For me as well, it has been mostly about winning arguments with people I am closed to. It often works by sharing good stories I have experienced.
Following @kate_g's train of thoughts, they exist but they do not listen. They say the wrong things. They try to "fix" people. Is that so, Kate? I have no experience of my own to contribute.From an OpenCare perspective: they exist. But are they provided by communities to themselves? Or is someone cast as the "solution provider" and someone else as the "vulnerable group in need of help"?
If you Google "mental health support group" and add Liverpool, London, Brighton, Brussels or just about any other location in the EU, you get a lot of links to groups already actively doing what is being described here (from what I gather, could be I'm missing something).  If you add "online" to that you still get relevant results, though far fewer.My question then is, how would what's being described, or at least hinted at, here be different or perhaps better than what is already going on.  Or, how can the exisiting activity be supplemented or improved?  Or, is the idea to use online communication to reach entirely other people than who uses these existing resources?   
Yours is already a very useful contribution @kate g, thanks so much. It signals we're on a good track - that we need to approach this with care, with focus on peer listening (already a strong point made by the folks cited in the notes above), and with some magic combination between digital and open ended conversations + structured/ generic/ maybe even ritualized format of fostering exchanges. You mentioned Geneva and therapy work, and reminded me to also include @Kaja in this conversation, who was/is(?) working there and looking into alternative therapy practice.. Kaja, curious if you have tried anything around group work? Or do you have any insights about ways in which communities trying to help themselves and members become more emotionally resilient can borrow things that work in the professional practice?  No need to reinvent wheels if there's good stuff already there.
Ok, so here's the intuition I see in your comment, @kate_g.Take an online community with a commitment to constructive interaction – one with quite strong community management. It is not so far from a support structure based on human-to-human listening. You could probably hack your way from healthy community to support structure.Is that it? If so, it is quite actionable, therefore powerful. 
I don’t know - I’m open - I was interested in this topic wanted to put down some thoughts.Instinctively I’m drawn to systems that allow people to vocalise, listen and be listened to in a particular place. Perhaps the digital simply helps to organise something which is then a “live” experience. There’s a long history of formal conversations as playing a vital part in processing atrocities - I will not write another long mail of examples! - but it made me wonder if that kind of designed experience (sharing experience, care, validation, human dignity) can be made into a more generic invitation.  There’s something in the idea about spending distinct and limited periods of time in group processes around emotional processing and communication. Feels like that is useful to all as you say - an often over-looked necessary act of hygiene perhaps. Particularly important for those trying to work and live in different ways - living on the edge takes some real practical and emotional resilience, as edgeryders articulates so well.When it comes to practical implementation, I’m setting up an experiment in Brighton for September around place and sharing experience & looking out for volunteer opportunities in psychotherapy group work. Just starting up a collab working with the Uni of Geneva Center for Affective Sciences on touch and emotions - though that’s not focussing on emotion processing from a cultural perspective, which is what grabbed me about the initiative above.A slow burner - personally, I need to gain some more active experience to be really useful on this - and very happy to follow this discussion & input if relevant. & the Nepal connection… Worked on a small project in Liverpool after the Nepal earthquake, a Nepalese hornbill audio sculpture that explored how network technology could make audible the word on the street & the dreams people were having http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/  Was designed to be developed for Nepal, but it was vandalised so back to the drawing board with it… hope it will come through in time. Simple experience gained in the process of making the work around the dramatic power of shared expression for processing trauma & that network tech makes possible new ways of facilitating this. All sorts of problems around crowd sourcing psychotherapy - equal relations and shared experience feels like a stronger emphasis: designing systems for "live", sincere, courageous conversations which puts some trust back in the (extended) neighbourhood as equipped to hold together around the varieties of experiences endured on this earth. 
Well met again, @kate g! This is a hell of a comeback.There seems to be a deep intuition here. "Something about the experience of another person..." this is how we learn everything in Edgeryders, we discourage vouching opinions and encourage sharing stories (preferably one's own) because they are so much thicker and richer. This is across the board, not just around mental health – in fact we had not gone into discussing mental health so far, not really.What I don't understand is: are you thinking around some online space for this? Wait, what? Nepal? Now that's a coincidence :-) 
And here it is. This rings very true. No one can "fix" anyone else (unless in emergency surgery, probably). But humans excel at support, when we can be bothered! 
"that everyone who lives in a distributed area is in someway involved in processing the emotions experienced in that place"Beautiful idea, it feels too beautiful to not be true. Like mathematic formulae.
Ever since the election in the UK I've been doing a lot of vox pop on the streets (Liverpool, Paris, Brighton) and listening to people around the question of what do you long for in the place where you live? I've been trying out different ways of leading people towards this question, either through asking about their dreamlife or asking them to imagine themeselves into a future they would like to live in. Through these talks it came up again and again that a lot of people really were living through enormously challenging situations and traumas and very willing to normalise it in conversation and shrug it off. Listening to people simply as humans without any judgements around what kind of state they were in (eg. seeing all the people I met simply as humans experiencing the world, rather than classifying some as experiencing states that were "abnormal" or could be classed as "mentally ill") felt like a helpful thing - the urge to have one's experience understood unites everyone. I was thinking about networks that could help this (and thinking around digital networks - Airbnb / dating apps etc. and looked at some mental health apps ) I was mostly thinking about place and the fact that it is true of all places that there would be really wretched experiences in need of processing and how this reality is something that needed stepping up to.  I don't know of many political utopias that really take into account neurodiversity and conditions like dementia.This perspective is drawn from my experience of talking to a multitude of strangers these last few months and I realise there are many many issues when it comes to mental health. But I'll share my naive view as I've been considering the role that I'd taken up in wandering about listening to whoever wanted or needed to talk and about the emotional healing of groups of people and how we so inadequately meet that in product driven cultures. The experience left me thinking that peer support was exactly what was needed by a lot of people. Psychologists are too expensive for most and online tick boxes are not at all like being listened to or sharing experience. There is something in spoken expression, being listened to and accepted that is just vital for emotional processing. With a few technologists I prototyped some systems that used voice recordings to play back these "real" expressions to others. Again the emphasis was not on mental illness but on the similarities and the differences in the longings of the inhabitants of particular locations - the project was inspired by thinking about how it might be possible to make networks in Nepal that in some way help the expression and social processing of the shock around the earthquake. However, there had been a depth in the experience of the interchanges that had happened whilst making the recordings that were more interesting than the voice playback system. The interviews always came out of a "live" sharing of experience (ie. the interviewee's expeirences and my own) and involved risk, personal disclosure, agency and shared discovery in a way that listening to a recording does not. I am still wondering about digital systems that allow people to talk directly to each other in a structured way that could help them process their emotional situations. And I considered the various kinds of conversations people might want - just to speak or perhaps a more formal recorded conversation that involved making a commitment. Witnessed formal statements - like rituals - can create marker points in people's lives. Alchoholic's anonymous is probably a relevant example. I wondered about the Samaritans model which sets up this sense that you can make a telephone call if you are desperate and the "Samaritan" is steady, sane and absolutely OK. I wonder about a network that simply says: whatever you are going through is part of the human experience ie. there is no broken experience, but there certainly is incredibly challenging experience.  It feels like a given that two people who are in grief may find solace in sharing their real experience and connecting.  And yet, to generalise, Western communities often put empahsis on usefulness in society and direct those exhibiting signs of mental distress to simply "be OK" / go on medication / fix themeselves -  I totally agree with the point you are bringing out that "the community" is often woefully dysfunctional at supporting or accepting unusual emotional situations. I wonder about a network that links people as humans wanting to share something specific in a particular area of the world - so the region is the unifier, not the emotional suffering. Perhaps I'm thinking of a more generalised target audience than you are considering but my sense is after walking Liverpool, that everyone who lives in a distributed area is in someway involved in processing the emotions experienced in that place. I'm aware this is a poetic notion but I think various imaginative re-framings of the issue of mental health is what's needed. Maybe this would only work as a three way conversation with someone trained and with really clear guidelines around use but my thinking here is that what's needed is not this expert / patient relationship but two humans sharing different experiences of living in a similar place. My friend Denis Ngala at TICAH, the Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health, an organisation in Kenya that works in linking health and cultural knowledge was telling me about the work that was being done in Kenya around victims of torture and reintegrating them back into society after they had given freedom again. The emphasis he was communicating was that recovery was not the problem of the victim of torture alone, but that it was the community's task. They were working to educate the community around how to support the individual live beyond what they had lived through.Real-life conversations from real experience in which neither party is an expert can be life changing. I work a lot with VR and seeing through another's eyes is certainly helpful but what really leads to change is honestly communicating difficult experience and listening to others and accepting their experience. There's some sort of validation in the honesty of that process that allows for shifts. There are lots of CBT, brain training, "look at things brighter" apps around but perhaps there's room for bold digital networks - with some serious legal tick boxes in place - that make possible structured honest relational experiences between people in a particular place. It feels like using the digital to practice honestly speaking and speaking in one's own name rather than anonymously would be helpful at this point. The histories of Snapchat et al. show the many superficial ways that communication can go, but there's a saviness emerging around structuring and limiting online encounter and creating a precise invitation that makes me think it's possible. Online experiences that move into relational and creative territory and away from the sense that mental difficulties have to be born alone like a scapegoat in the desert or solved once and for all like winning in a game - there's something about the unique experience of another person that is a random element that can startle out of insularity. An app for conversation for people in a particular country? A way of marking personal commitments to the self and receiving some real social validation for it? A whole raft of comedy solutions that normalise being in dire straights and make it feel like it's worth making the epic journey back to life? Not sure, but you're right that there is a real need for help with processing emotions and it's something that a healthy culture should be able to give.  
Someone like me who is not a creative or art professional could simply read the emotional stress as common angst. Stress is so widespread nowadays most of us are struggling in a way, so.. really don't know.Have you looked into art therapy or therapeutic gardening? Also, my newest friend @Finbar247 in Ireland who is both an accomplished artist and "an old soul" (we like to joke :)) might be able to offer more advice. Hang in there.
Hey Alex and Noemi!thanks for your support. To your questions Alex: Yes they are allowed to leave the camp. Its kind of hard for them to bring friends inside who dont live there though (pretty weird feeling because it was so easy for us to enter) We actually had a little experiment today and brought materials like duckt tape, cable ties, strings, cardboard (materials that you dont necessarily need proffessional tools for) to one room to see what would happen. Just after a little time os insecurity they started finding solutions in terms of "unpacking". That seems to be the biggest issue.. The room is a organised mess and they wanted to have items to put their stuff in. It was a really cool experience to see how everyone together was solving problems. In the end we had two really nice shelf constructions!There is a lot of unused material inside the camp, that is going to be thrown away.. if there would be better communication between the organisation and the refugees they could probably use these too.. (to be fair: the Malteser who are running the camp are already having kind of good communication.. so far we only good positive feedback and lots of permissions!) But i really like the idea of going out of the camp to get materials, also because in the end its about not only having the courage to hack the "comfort zone" but to feel able and free in the "outside world" (that is really a feeling of home) 
Pauline, your post made me think of my brother. At school he was artistic and a left hander, naturally talented at sport, and very sensitive (for example, he once walked into a house and sensed a ghost, which the owners later confirmed; another time, he avoided a major accident because he sensed something and changed his route on his motorbike). Life has been a bit of a struggle for him - he has pursued conventional success and it didn't suit his temperament and he complains about life being constant suffering (although sometimes it as if he seems to enjoy the suffering, otherwise why would he keep doing it?). He also drinks alcohol a lot - I have always asssumed this is because he finds life challenging, because he is so sensitive.  Having said this, he is still creative and charming and loveable. But he is hard to be with sometimes.I think modern life makes it very hard for such people and you need to try to find ways to live on the edge, and places to escape.
That's very informative, @jdossou80@yahoo.com, thanks. It seems that in the USA and Europe there is a "middle generation": people that got on the Internet when it was still relatively new, let's say before 2006. Those people managed to see the tail end of the noncommercial Internet; and they remember what it means for using a website to to be "hard": slow dialup connections, textual interfaces, floppy disks with vintage browsers like Mosaic and Netscape. These people make good online collaborators; they go for content and community, and if they need to work a little harder to get it they will. This means they will forgive you websites like Edgeryders, that do not have the usability firepower of Facebook. Younger people here are harder to engage. They have never known anything but superfast Internet with integrated video, always available on their smartphones. They do not miss the free, noncommercial web of the early days, an  have less patience for minor technical flaws. From what you say, Africa skipped the early phase of the Internet. Almost everyone who is online now got online in the last 5 years. They have never known anything but Facebook. It is the only game in town. Hmmm. 
Keep it up and stay safe, Anna!
Will keep the LOTE6 idea in mind, great one!I think our future Open Clinic, in the form of which it can come out as our dream spinoff from OpenCare, will have a large food component to it.Well, we never had an explicit conversation about food on edgeryders. In and of itself it's not actionable: everyone eats, a lot of people love it period. But because it can become an instrument of sorts it tends to pop up in conversations where you wouldn't expect it. It's a real resource: available, comes in handy and yet underpins complex relations. Moreover, if we think in terms of food enterprises around care - should we ever decide to support one (maybe a project in the making) - they already have a higher degree of sustainability embedded in it than most projects.  
This sounds like a fantastic project!Perhaps we could encourage them to get involved with the (potential) Food on the Edge section of LOTE6?It's really interesting seeing the ways in which food culture is feeding into the OpenCare project. It almost seems like the 2 areas are symbioticly linked.
Hi Pauline,This definitely resonates with me. I realy want to share my thoughts on this with you, but i need some time to think about how best to structure them.I thought i'd say thank you for sharing first and then respond in a day or 2.Alex
For inspiration check the brief here on the right: https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4j46cz/weekly_check_in_how_are_you_this_week/ I especially liked this:Our focus is on support rather than "fixes". If you are looking for a more solution-oriented community, check out/r/getting_over_it/ or /r/GetMotivated. orDo not post or respond with:"Tough love" of any description.General uplifting or "it gets better" messages. Encouragement is not helpful unless it integrates real, personal understanding of the OP's feelings and situation.Anything explicit or inciting related to suicide or self harm.Claims about the efficacy of any treatment or self-help strategy including religion.Thinking about our OpenCare brief in the making, or Pauline & Omri's project design: we need to signal the rules of the space somehow in order to build trust that the person sharing is in the right space: if it's for peer support vs if it's a project/solution space etc. 
Hi Tomma,Thank you so much for sharing this. It's fascinating to see that there isn't a huge difference between the way people react to their spaces in an official camp and an unofficial camp like the Calais 'Jungle'.Noone ever likes the food that is provided.Are residents allowed out of the camp during the day? Are they allowed to bring anything they want back in with them? Or are they basically in detention?Because if the can leave and bring anything back in then why not provide a space nearby where they can come and collect donated items, tools etc in exchange for doing something else (e.g. cooking food for a cafe, running a cafe, teaching arabic, sharing their culture etc)Alex
This is a takeout restaurant in Pittsburgh cooking food from countries with which the US is in conflict. What seems to be really great is that for the time dedicated to a country they run a whole campaign gathering research, interviews, events, workshops like virtual cooking lessons and from what I could see also debunking American media myths.It's an interesting angle to the food - culture- public art, and probably why they're still running after 5 years. Here's their website should you want to be inspired: http://conflictkitchen.org/
..do you think you could get permission? Another think that you might consider was pointed out by Alex (volunteer in Calais/ Dunkirk camps) in a response to Milan's similar efforts: "My suggestion is first to ask them how you can help, rather than guessing. We talk to community leaders on the camp every 2 weeks and ask for suggestions so we can improve our processes"  That conversation is here, should you wish to exchange ideas.Very excited to see you guys doing so much practical research, keep it up!
Hey Dennis,there is a community garden called Himmelbeet in Wedding that might be an interesting project for you to check out! Volunteers can just come in during the opening hours and just see what kind of work there is to do - usually always something, from gardening to building stuff to preparing workshops. They have alot of projets going on and would be more than happy to talk to you, I am sure. I believe that some refugees work there too, or would be very welcome at least! Actually, I just started volunteering there some weeks ago. For their Spring Opening Fest, I helped set up and supervise a little stall for people to make Stockbrot. At first, it was us preparing the bread for the guests and then they would cook it over the fire. However, some of the refugees that were there were very interested in the process, so I started to teach them how to make it. Turns out one of them had been a baker in Syria, which was great, because he showed me some tricks on how to handle the dough more easily and he could translate to the others the different types of wheat and seeds we had laid out to sprinkle on the dough. Others were preparing more sticks or making wood fore the fire. Soon, all the 'volunteers' were the ones sitting around the fire and eating bread. Hope this helped you a little!
Answering that question requires examining the roots of the conflict, the context in which it arose, and the factors that have kept it going. This study offers some frank evaluations of the efforts made over the years to resolve the conflict, some of which have not been discussed publicly except in the partisan narratives of one side or the other.
This talk is very intersting 
Your insights are important to team JUS.
We´ll do a meeting on monday with 4 Germans and 4 people that don´t speak proper German yet.And we are about to get in contact with the volunteer agency of Berlin to find Germans.
It's not me. The reason should be that we need to populate channels in order to make it easier for people to browse the website and retrieve older content by looking at topics.Now, the solution I see to not mix up non-OpenCare content with OpenCare is: if there is a way to assign older posts to groups different than Op3nCare, but still convert them into challenge responses (to benefit from channels assigned), that would be ideal!
Hi Alberto,sorry for taking so long to reply. You make an important point! This issue works the other way around as well of course, there has to be a mutual understanding between care givers and care takers.Do you know anyone who might know how the situation is in the context of refugees? I believe the project group of @Cindy, @MarieScheurer and @HoneyMk have been investigating some of the communicative issues between refugees and official institutions in Germany. Maybe hearing other peoples experiences might be helpful for you, Group Chat Mate?
One important point I forgot to stress: actually getting help took long. Admitting to myself and to my friends that I had a problem took a great deal of energy, but nothing compared to the procedure that dragged on for months before I was able to get treatment.As a first contact, the university counsellor was a good help. However, the number of appointments one can have with them is very limited. Getting a place in therapy is difficult. There are annoying regulations in order to get the insurance to cover it. I had to be rejected at 10 different therapists until I found someone who still had a space. I was lucky that we were a good match, but others search for a long time until they find someone they feel comfortable with.I saw a doctor too, which did some tests to see that there are no physical causes to my symptoms. And then some more tests. And of course, appointments were only to be had 6 weeks in advance. The same went for seeing a psychiatrist about medication. When you are depressed and little things like getting out of bed take you a seemingly impossible amount of energy, this effort is incredibly draining and frustrating. It seems like an insurmountable pile of hoops to jump through. There is this turning point where you decide that something needs to happen, that you need some kind of help now, because you don't know what to do anymore, and then you are told that the next possible appointment is in 8 weeks. What am I going to do until then? Is it possible to somehow improve this process? What kinds of other temporary support structures might there be that could help people in distress?  
@Noemi, I assume this is you associating older posts about care to the group. This is of course OK. But some of them seem to be quite theoretical (example). Can you write here some remarks about your  criteria for doing so? The number of people involved in the conversation almost doubled since yesterday, with people like Irene Lanza, SARCHA, Emiliano Fatello, FreeLab...
Hi Noemi,again, sorry for taking so long to reply. I'll try to be better with catching up on comments (somehow I don't seem to be getting notifications when somebody comments my post and then I forget very quickly).Thank you for your input! As you might have seen, our project group have now settled on a slightly different topic as part of the mental and spiritual resilience challenge. Still, I think we wilI keep these reflections in mind, particularly the idea of smart villages. I'm not sure I quite understand how it works yet, I'll have to look into it.Yet too often our jobs starve us of what is most precious — the time and space to express who we truly are — social, curious, playful and purposeful humans. [..]. We believe that there is a growing demand for smart villages where we can design our ideal balanced lives. Places where we can live in harmony with nature. We can create a safe and happy home for our families. And we don’t have to sacrifice our careers and dreams to make this happen.We are still a little unsure what direction we are headed in, but I do think this relates to the question of emotional wellbeing and the starting point that @NeleG set with her post on the pressure to function and succeed at the risk of burnout, as well as @Omri_Kaufmann's thoughts on who we share our feelings with and how we might facilitate sharing with people close to us - if that is 'family' by any definition or something else. 
Hi Luija,sorry for not replying so long. Thank you for your perspective, it was very enlightening! We studied 20th century China quite rigorously in school, so I had some idea of the political, social and technological developments, yet as an expat I always felt very much isolated from the life reality of the locals. As I said, I never really had much contact with the 'real', 'authentic' Chinese medical system, because there were so many reservations about it. The issues that we encountered in those clinics that specialized on Westerners sound harmless compared to what you talked about! Do you know if there is anything being done now to improve the system? 
ping @Alex Levene , @Yara Al Adib , @Mousab Alshikh  ...maybe you have some experience dealing with Belgian institutions around health stuff?
Hi Noemi, sorry for taking so long to get back to you. I have to admit that I can't exactly tell you what kind of language was being used in the Chinese medical system - mainly because the only contact I myself had with Chinese doctors was always in the context of institutions that somewhat catered specifically to Westerners. Being a child, I wasn't quite so aware of it, but from what I remember hearing in conversations between my parents and their expat friends, there was a sense of fear and mistrust in the Chinese system. The cultural communications issue was one worry, but there were also reservations about hygiene and safety standards. In general, the quality of medical care seemed to be perceived poorer than the Western methods. However, I am in no position to judge if these were actually justified assumptions or if it was more a matter of perception.
I think the wording is a good point. Mental health to me still carries very strong connotations that makes it an intimidating issue to deal with. It's very interesting to see what kind of care and support structures are available out there, how they are perceived and what causes what kind of people to approach them (or not). The note you made about it being easier to share something anonymously is also something we'll keep in mind and explore further.I'm looking forward to the online discussion on Monday, thank you for setting it up!
I just thought it would be a nice way to meet new people and just hang out in a natural, uncontrived way if people can easily invite their friends...
Hey Nadia,thank you for your post!We were wondering if it´s not probaply the right way to bring a small group of people together to provote interaction between people of dirrerent mothertounge and to prevent that groups stay together in their comfort zone. We´ll probaply do it on monday.But I´m curious, what is your idea behind setting up a big event?Best regardsMarie
Disability is a gradient. Some humans can run marathons in under three hours. Me? No. Does it mean I am disabled? No. But if you could run a marathon in under three hours, and then for some reason (age, lack of training) you lost that ability, you would feel diminished. Moreover, disability is multidimensional. Is Stephen Hawking disabled? Yes, in a way. His body is weaker than mine. But if you look at brains, fame, achievements...  who's the disabled guy here?Yet another example of when labels do not make sense. 
Hi Marie,this looks interesting, I am back in Berlin on the 17th-27th and would certainly join you if you did it on any day except for the 18th when I am at an all day meeting. To get more people on board I suggest creating an event on the Meetups page, and we can use social media to let Berlin know about it :so more people join :)The instructions for how to add another event to the page are at the bottom. Ask if you need help! 
No, other examples of care services that rewire themselves so as to (1) establish themselves as "owned" by the community and (2) bypass stifling regulation. 
I'm not familiar with the project and do not really immiedetly see what my contributon should be. References to previous insights on how private services are more customer oriented than public?
Well language is powerful, it carries and enforces assumptions even without someone intending to. It seems like there are few words we have as society to express care for those assumed to need it more than others - disability/ handicap/ disease.  Maybe they don't need more care than others, as we are all disabled in a way. We all fall under categories of the state anyway and at some point need "special" considerations -for example student discounts carry the same type of distinction: you are a student, therefore you have less money, therefore you need extra help to access some services. Yet we call it "discount for students" not discount for poor students.Will keep thinking about this, and good luck with your design @Moriel.
I've asked for them to get me some links to documents that show the link between excercise and positive mental heath.They're going to get me some internet links so i can share the here
This doesn't have to be a 'full-blown' mental illness, but any thing that has weighed on them emotionally. @Moushira suggested yesterday in our community call that engaging people to share their issues shouldn't be put under headers of "mental health" but under something more like "emotional health". Similarly,  @Thom_Stewart is setting up an initiative for any person in distress - clinical or not; mental per se of not. I think this kind of inclusiveness can contribute to lowering the threshold as mentioned above.Guys, next Monday we are hosting an online conversation about emotional care, feel free to join in at 4:30 PM.PS Pauline I loved emotionalbaggagecheck.com, what a sweet project! thanks for sharing it.
This sounds really cool, Alex. A free gym... next up, skateboard, team sports and whatever. Can we know more about mental and social health effects? 
Hi Everyone!Thank you all for your responses! I'm afraid, I haven't yet caught up with the whole routine, so sorry for my impoliteness of answering late..We (the project group I'm part of) have been visiting a refugee camp in Berlin and had the chance to get in touch with a number of the people there. It seems like most projects with refugees focus on families and children, whereas the young men are being left out.How is the situation in other places? Has anyone made the same experiences? If that were the case, we would frame our research around working together with these young men.Right now, we're in contact with a group of Syrians, around 25-32 of age, who have given us insights on daily life in the camp but also daily life in Syria and we have spoken about the small moments that create the feeling of home.Since they are living in these rooms, which basically consist of for walls, no ceiling and four double beds, they themselves had already hacked the space in a way that would make their environment feel a bit more homey (or at least more practical).Seeing them already understanding the space and having the ideas to improve it, what more could they do and make, were they only given the material and the tools?Boredom and the feeling of not being able to progress seems to be the biggest problem, so they were welcoming the idea of getting active and being able to do something - anything - and when there's a result that is useful in their very situation, it's even better.At this stage, it's not about practical matters anymore, but it seems more like a search for emotional autonomy.
"Some may call it depression. Let’s say I am wary about medicalisation of the human condition, so to me it is just sadness.When I was younger these dips were more profound. Debilitating even. At some point a psychiatrist prompted me to take medication. I refused, opting instead to deal with what I thought might be the root causes….by changing my profession, lifestyle and social environment.Eventually I developed some resilience towards these inexplicable bouts of sadness. I would channel the nervous energy into doing meaningful work, and supporting the efforts of others in trying to do something that matters to them. With hindsight it has been a better choice for me than spending a fortune I don’t have on having a shrink try to figure out what is the matter with me…and how to fix it.Last week, the sadness returned. This time I am unable to find solace in the work. I am unsure as to why. It is not dramatic and there is no cause for alarm. However, I’ve noticed that the less time I spend on online, the better I feel. In part I think it is because communication for work purposes and to stay in touch with people about whom I care increasingly happen in the same channels. Which is not sustainable in the long run. So I am leaving Facebook, Twitter and linkedin for now. I will not cancel my accounts, but will not be checking them on a regular basis or keeping them updated.If you wish to stay in touch with me you have several choices:1) To be kept up to date with information about Edgeryders, unMonastery and future projects and opportunities I am involved in building, subscribe to Nadia at Work.2) If you are interested in reading me on more general topics like culture, tech, politics, art, religion, science, travels and life in general, subscribe to  News from Nadia.3) If you want to hang out you can always call me on skype (my alias is: niasan) or come visit me in Brussels, where I now live.I do hope you will choose to stay in touch one way or another. To those of you who choose otherwise, thank you for the time we have spent together- I do wish you all the best and hope our paths cross again sooner rather than later.With love,Nadia"
What about a picknick?everybody could bring something to ear / drinkwill interaction take place:)?
HOW CAN WE MOTIVATE GERMANS AND NON-GERMANS TO GO ON ACTIVITIES TOGETHER FOR IMPROVING THE SPEAKING OF GERMAN AND TO MAKE INTEGRATION EASIER?#1Reasearch with Non-Germans:-having a hard time to make German friends-are not brave enough to start a contact-think that the language is the biggest barrier-bad luck with tandem partners: they are not easy to find for every language / they don´t arrive at the appointment-high interest in small activities together with a German person to improve German and to lose fear of socialisation-they are having a better time learning German if they live together with Germans / it´s easier to get known to eaven more Germans if you already know even one-integration as a result of speaking German and speaking German as a result of integration / no integration as a result of not speaking German and not speaking German as a result of no integration #Research with Germans:-if they have time they would probaply spend it with a person who wants to learn German-if they would get small gifts / rabatt / coupons they would be motivated to take foreign people to their private activities-proposed activities would be visit of zoo, museums, city trips, sports, going outside, taking a walk, workshops etc. FURTHER PLANNED STEPS / OPEN QUESTIONS:-how can we define the group of people?-which activities are reasonable?-where do we catch the people?-what motivates Germans?-is the volenteer center / language school / a bar /etc. a good place?Happy for comments, ideas, experience etc.!!!Sunny regards, Marie  
We would love to hear it unless you are uncomfortable.JUS
I have been talking to someone at Calais who has set up a free community gym at the Calais camp.It works really well for mental health, engaging young men and encouraging interaction and participation.Perhaps something like this would be worth exploring?
Great sharing, JUS team and @Omri Kaufmann in particular! I am out of my depth: I have been sad but never depressed, exhausted but never burnt out. I have emotions, but they never seem to become medical conditions somehow. Lucky me. But many people seem to think it's the human touch that makes the difference in care. Even the best designed sofa will not make you any less lonely. The point is made (towards 12.00) by @Yara Al Adib in this video, since you want to be inspired you will probably like it! 
Hi Omri and Pauline,this is an interesting question. A couple of years ago I met someone whom I hadn't seen in a long time, a university pal. We had a long conversation about death because his Dad was unwell. Without thinking much of it I wrote a post about our encounter here. Check out the comments, you may find them of interest.When younger I found it quite difficult to even acknowledge feelings let alone talk about them. Especially not if it was a space where I knew I would be meeting the same people again and again. Something about not being able to shed skin and then move on made it feel like a trap. Then something snapped last year. I felt unable and unwilling to not be sad and let others know what was going on and what I needed to be ok + how they could interact with me. I unpublished it from my personal blog, but if it's helpful to you I can republish it here. Let me know. 
:)
Here are the links to @NeleG original post and my own experience on sharing feelingshttps://edgeryders.eu/en/on-being-a-self-entrepreneurhttps://edgeryders.eu/en/jus-sharing-is-scary
Hi Noemi, thanks for getting back to me. I definitively consider myself lucky and realize that I have a very strong support system. The thing that struck me was that even in my comparatively 'good' situation, it was so difficult for me to communicate my feelings. For me, this was a huge added pressure and kept me from getting help for a long time. In our project group, we are investigating how young people, particularly in creative professions/fields of study, deal with issues of mental well-being, who they share their feelings with, or why they don't. As we are still in the research phase, I actually wanted to stay away from thinking of a very specific solution already. There is a similar site called emotionalbaggagecheck.com, where you can either submit your thoughts anonymously or help someone who submitted a text by sharing a song and some kind words. The platform I was thinking of was more an idea of improving the communication between affected people, so that there is a lower threshold of reaching out for support when you feel bad. I was hoping to hear what experiences other people have had, what sort of stressors they struggle with and how they handle this. This doesn't have to be a 'full-blown' mental illness, but any thing that has weighed on them emotionally. This was related to @NeleG post about how we are under so much pressure to function and to succeed, that we risk our emotional (and as a result, often also our physical) well-being. A question we were asking ourselves as a group was how to challenge the perception or stigma on mental health issues and perhaps encourage people to be more open and share their feelings, especially with their loved ones. 
When I started reading your story I was already hearing the usual remarks people give - you know the worst thing to tell to someone who is depressed is "pull yourself together"; or "you have everything to be happy".Yet it seems your close friends and family did find a way to reach out, however ineffective or patronising, as any advice can be after all, which is not to blame.What made you share this, @Pauline? What design do you have in mind for the mutual understanding platform you see as a solution? One initiative I came across while researching the web for the mental health debate in OpenCare is BlueHackers - they have an IRC channel they use where anyone can drop in for a random conversation. It could be that sharing with strangers is sometimes easier than with closer people, so you could be on to something. But maybe you're not thinking of online platform?
Hello Alberto,Thanks for your interest and response. Ah! It sounds like you have tried to access the old website p-jones.demon.co.uk which was valid from 1998 up to last summer when Demon closed as an ISP.Sorry about that. My current studies will include posting some introductory information. I've just organised new hosting.I'd be happy to try to answer questions and will add a note on my blog / and to the papers I have re. the expired website.Kind regards,Peter Jones 
I have found the same problems in Calais. Support programs aim at engaging and helping children and women, but young men, who make up around 90% of the camp, are more difficult to engage.It's true that we see mental health issues on the camp, including depression. These people are currently not supported through any projects that i am aware of. We are also starting to see a growth in drug dependency amongst long-term residents on the camp, which is worrying.We also struggle with the fact that many of the men on camp do not see the camp, or France, as their final destination. So it is difficult to get them to engage in longer-term initiatives in Calais. We have some success with language classes in English and French. Also, construction projects are popular activities.Language exchange seems to be the best way to start engagement, after that i think it is food. Perhaps a community kitchen where they cook for you instead of always receiving support. My days at the camp are always full of offers to eat and drink food prepared by the residents.My suggestion is first to ask them how you can help, rather than guessing. We talk to community leaders on the camp every 2 weeks and ask for suggestions so we can improve our processes. They tell us how we can help them as much as we make our own decisions.
Hello @pjones, welcome to Edgeryders. I checked out briefly your blog: congratulations, you really are very active! But where is the model? I read your 2004 paper: I am a non-professional and may simply lack the knowledge to process it, but what it looks to me is that you are discussing a model that was presented somewhere else. There is a link at the end of the paper, but it points to a site no longer active. Would you have a "Hodges model for dummies" somewhere?Ping @markomanka, he'll know a lot more than me. 
Insomma, non stai più hackerando la sedia a rotelle, ma te stesso. Diventando tu stesso un maker, sposti la tua disabilità da condizione immutabile in problema da risolvere. Se è così, che dire, chapeau.Però, senti: nel mondo maker anche i viaggi interiori si fanno smanettando su progetti, no? In smanettamento veritas. E bisogna pure smanettare su qualcosa! Mi chiedevo solo se state ragionando di cosa fare nelle prossime settimane. 
@steelweaver, @Noemi, I think you are zeroing in on something important. Here's what I'm reading.Like other people in the space we are calling open care (small letters: the concept, not the project), you, @steelweaver, are rewiring care services as community-driven. Your way to do so is the donation model. The Helliniko crowd's is the refuse to incorporate. What different ways have in common is this: they build trust and style these services as community-driven, and the communities as the owners. They also sidestep regulation, perceived as stifling. @teirdes and @markomanka are full of stories on why this perception is at least partially correct. @Lakomaa could probably offer additional insights.Such radical thinking frees up creativity and enable bottom-up emergence of more care in society.However, it also means you guys are very vulnerable. Noemi is right on the money: if an "Uber for health" were to emerge, it would be sued into a smoking hole at the first signs of scaling. Which makes me think that not scaling is a better solution for survivability of open care: sueing thousands of small initiatives is harder and more costly than going for the one Uber. Hmmm.But Noemi is proposing regulation as some kind of shelter for these initiatives. Would this work? To a first approximation, I am doubtful. Uber has access to legal advice, and they undoubtedly ran checks on their model before going live. But then they get sued. The sueing party claims that something in that model should be interpreted like something else already in the legal system. For example "an Uber driver is like the employee of a taxi company" or "if you rent out your spare room on Airbnb you become a hotel". If it wins the case (as it tends to do), then the sentence becomes a precedent. European version: lobbyists get the law change the way they want it. So, these innovative, disintermediating solutions start off as legal, but then they are made illegal as they begin scaling. All of which is pretty depressing, I must admit. Hope you guys can contradict me :-)
sorry for my late response and thanks for yours! Our group met today and we discussed our new challenges. Last week we applied for a contest wich is about encunters between refugee migrants and locals arround karl-marx-straße in berlin. we are still waiting for feedback. what we want to focus on as a target group are alone travelling men because we learned, that they don´t get enouth attencion or the offers are just not fitting good enough. They tend to have a loss of orientation after their jurney during their long waiting-times. Tomorrow we are going to make interviews with lot of people and hopfully get new input for design tasks. Stay tuned :)Milan
I´m very glad to see you responding to our first insight. I´m sorry to anwer this late, still getting used to edgeryders. Indeed your knowledge arround these other Migrant Camps could be very helpful. In our research we learned, that there are a lot of programs an projects for families but few for alone travelling men. Also these mostly syrian men tend to fall in a hole after travelling and having a stressful time. Do you know these problems? What do you think how we can empower them or get them focused on new goals? Are there specific challenges the migrants in Calais or Dunkirk are facing?Milan
While building trust in the service while ofering affordability and humane treatment is definitely a plus, the questions remains and it's for us to try to answer in the future looking at stories like yours (which is what OpenCare community essentially does): what happens when a number of such care services become available? We have great insights, yet risk running completely unprotected. The more they grow effective or meet a growing demand, the more attention they draw, the more concurential they become, the more they risk being antagonised by systems on more-or-less valid concerns. Uber being exhibit A.. @markomanka maybe has more interesting insights as to minium criteria which can make health services like these legit from system's perspective.
What a story, @Timothy_Daly. Thank you for sharing it with us, and welcome to Edgeryders and OpenCare, our research project. This really makes you wonder, reminded me of the Rosenhan experiment.The detail that most appealed to my Kafkaesque understanding of faceless institutions, was that the refusal to accept that he was mad was taken as evidence that he was still mad. Refusing to take the pills that made him heavy and slow and stupid was seen as proof that his sanity had still not returned. Now you just try to imagine regaining your mental balance under this kind of perverse authority.Do you have ideas on how to better the situation for someone like Dave? is a temp squat really doing anything good for him, or what would be a way to recovery that is dignifying? If you're involved in or know of systematic community efforts, do tell.  If you're more into the research and observation: we're struggling to put together a brief for stories about mental resilience, a set of questions that are solution-oriented and not intimidate people to share things that after all are very private in an online environment. Help if this is something of interest to you?
Hi @Noemi,Well, working on a donation basis was my nod to being a non-commercial entity, which (as far as I know) means the clinic is not subject to licensing - similarly to people who volunteer in hospices, addiction recovery centres etc.I am conflicted on this - on the one hand, I recognise that some degree of regulation of healthcare is probably desirable to avoid malpractice and protect patients (or at least it was desirable before networked reputation economies became a possibility - who knows what alternative models might be possible now?).On the other hand, I was certainly struck by the degree to which stepping outside the commercial model of delivery freed me up to do things differently.It's also made it far easier to get 'buy-in' from the community so that they think of it as something that belongs to them, that they can collaborate with. The terms of interaction defined by our habits of commercial consumption go deep, and having some way to differentiate yourself from it seems very important in encouraging people to thnk and act differently.
Grazie Nadia! :-)
Nel corso della prima sessione di co-design avvenuto lo scorso mercoledì presso WeMake nell’ambito del Progetto OpenCare ho avuto modo di esplicitare due miei interessi particolarmente “complessi”, quali la mobilità e la residenzialità prevalentemente per le persone con disabilità fisico motorie, confrontandomi con le sensibilità e le aspettative dei miei “compagni” di gruppo, impegnandoci a sviscerare problemi, elencare ostacoli e ad escogitare idee risolutive.Al quesito di cosa possa fare WeMake, ma sopratutto il Progetto, potrei sicuramente e molto facilmente rispondere con una richiesta di rendere quanto più possibile concreti questi sogni. Tuttavia la migliore replica che potrei dare è quella, altrettanto “semplice”, di pormi nella condizione di sintetizzatore e di promotore dei miei bisogni, abbandonando le resistenze dettate da una forma mentis descritta nel mio post e che è molto difficile da cambiare anche per me.Credo sia questo il valore innovativo di questo percorso piuttosto che il prodotto o il servizio che andremo a progettare – e magari ad implementare – del quale comunque verrà considerata la capacità di cogliere una richiesta e di dare una risposta concreta.Sono arrivato a WeMake attraverso lo hipe di Arduino e con una visione limitata alla mia mobilità auspicando la realizzazione di una carrozzella elettronica più intelligente e predisposta ai miei bisogni reali quotidiani. Oggi comprendo che la vera sfida non concerne esclusivamente gli aspetti tecnologici, per altro non di poca rilevanza, quanto piuttosto il raggiungere uno obiettivo condiviso da più persone.Insomma, parafrasando una antica saggezza, il Progetto pone ciascuno di noi al centro di un viaggio in primo luogo interiore “soppesando” solo successivamente con la sensibilità e la determinazione di quanti presenti sul tracciato la valenza e le opportunità della meta.
... e grazie dei complimenti. OpenCare per ora è una bella idea. Per diventare un progetto importante deve crescere tanto. Speriamo di poterlo fare insieme. Per te in particolare, quale pensi possa essere il prossimo passo? Cosa ti piacerebbe fare con WeMake e OpenCare? 
Stoleggendo le vostre riflessioni, grazie per il tempo dedicato a condividerle. Mi ci vuole un po 'più tempo per scrivere in italiano, ma cercherò di condividere le mie esperienze in questo fine settimana!
ah bene bene! vedo con piacere che stai prendendo alla grnade confidenza con la EdgeRyders :)il tuo più che ben accetto protagonismo è prezioso (e competente!) il secondo punto mi piace un bel po' ;) @Francesco Maria ZAVA
Google translate is not very coherent, sorry!If you're thinking of a project for people to get involved in while they wait before and after Amnesty International efforts, you might want to consider waiting times in order to filter participants in and out. @Yara Al Adib was kind enough to share this timeline for refugee "integration" in Belgium. From what I remember the longest times where after they are identified or have basic papers and before they are found housing- so during the rounds of interviews:  https://edgeryders.eu/sites/edgeryders.eu/files/Arriving%20to%20BE.pdf
Hi Milan,This sounds like a great start for the project. I'm interested to hear more.If you want to know more about how these types of system work at the Migrant Camps in Calais or Dunkirk let me know.If you manage to take your idea further then i'd be interested to hear more and see if there is anything we can learn from your trial.Alex
Thank you for the detail, it seems you have figured a lot out over the years. Also, as you can see Alberto and I are very much into communities, so for me the question is always around the "how", how people organise, how you get things catering to such a large group. And I know from experience that moving from the online to running offline activities is suprisingly hard - some people to the first great, some people to the second one great, but being able to pull off both seems like a big win. And the balance for you seems to be in doing prevention in a fun way: "There is a need to find the right balance between specificity (focus on the main purpose of the group) and attractivity (diversity of topics and angle of view, pictures, news etc..) in such a way that users have a feeling of distraction while they are exposed to the key messages of prevention of CVD." And in collaboration, which is our bet too for edgeryders.What do others think?

Hi @ChristineOehme and welcome on board! You might want to read @dennis on this same approach - learning about not belittling anyone through language or actions (even unintended). His story is called A New Chapter in Other People's Story BooksYour intuition about needs we all have is also spot on. I was reading the other day a telling piece on Medium explaining how "most humans alive right now are broken. Our communities have been stripped of gathering places. We find ourselves isolated and alone, with heads in the digital cloud and eyes fixed to the screen. We are not ready to look one another in the eye. The shame we feel as we strive to do everything right (the way we were taught) — as we fail to get jobs, are unable to keep up with growing rental prices, and are displaced increasingly from our homes — that shame and humiliation is why we don’t come together." (source)The author's thesis is that we can't provide care for others until we regenerate ourselves. I have to say, I find it hard to disagree. Any thoughts?
Hello and welcome, @ChristineOehme! This is a recurring theme in Edgeryders. The whole social cohesion industry is based on the notion of "vulnerable groups". People belong to such groups if they bear the markers of some kind of disadvantage, for example the dark (or light) skin of an ethnic minority, or a physical or mental disability. Belonging to vulnerable groups can be temporary: for example, there is a group called "the unemployed", thought to merit special care, even though no one is born into this group. Like many people around here, I dislike the notion. There are two problems:Labelling. People are included in a "vulnerable group" by somone sticking a label on them. I am a migrant. You are a female. He is transgender. The labels are not incorrect, but they imply that my having migrated is what is important about me. When providing care, the label will be inspiring the design of the services that target me. "Representative agent". Once they have a group to service, care providers set up services with the average component of that group in mind. This activity misses out on the richness of human diversity, and it usually ends up mass-producing services that suck. Right now, we are seeing the damage done by this concept in the so-called migrants issue in Europe. A Syrian doctor (or engineer, or carpenter) is labeled a refugee and stuck in a camp, where another doctor (European) will assess his health. He might be ten times more experienced than his European colleague, but he is not allowed to diagnose himself and others because – guess what – in that context he "is" a not a doctor, but a refugee.@Alex Levene told me a funny-heartbreaking story from The Jungle (check out his post, it's really interesting). He talked to an Afghan guy in the camp. He fled Afghanistan because he is an atheist, and that's led him to trouble. He wants to live in a place where agnosticism is common, bigotry can't touch him and nobody cares what you pray to. And there he is, in a refugee camp, surrounded by muslims, and everyone goes to great lengths to do everything in a way that will work for muslims. They assume that, since he is Afghan and the average afghan is muslim, he must be muslim: when in fact he is persecuted by muslims. 
Food waste is largely about food that doesn't even end up in your fridge - it gets wasted before that. See example of supermarkets throwing away perfectly good food as a very common one.   
It is amazing to read you, as you raise sharply some key concerns that the group is facing.1- How do we help? The facebook group is just one of the means/tools of the group. As a group, with the resources available for us and the main gaps identified at the national level, we focus on promotional and preventive care. We concentrate in this group, global and local evidence relevant for anyone to prevent cardiovascular diseases.   Beyond the key "theoretical" principles of WHO, we try to find out, how to raise and to support the motivation of people to change sustainably their dangerous behaviors. There is a need to find the right balance between specificity (focus on the main purpose of the group) and attractivity (diversity of topics and angle of view, pictures, news etc..) in such a way that users have a feeling of distraction while they are exposed to the key messages of prevention of CVD. I perceive that in my context, Facebook is first of all used in for distractive purposes. The online facebook group, is not a tool for curative or palliative care such as online consultations with drug prescriptions. Medical doctors are involved in the discussions and if required, they can give offline, specific orientations to go for curative consultations; but discussions in the group, do not involve curative or palliative care.2- How do we collaborate? Online, each member has the right to share what matter for him, that is related to the focus of the group. This can be a question, a picture, a video, a comment etc... The use of this right of free expression in such a group is not so high everytime of the year. If you scroll down further, you will find periods of high participation  on some specific subject with high interest and later some period of low or no engagement. This depends on several factors, that we are still learning about. I attach to this comment a screenshot that presents a collaborative construction of an answer to a question raised in the group. I can send to you the whole power point if you want.3- Dealing with the traps of facebook, how? Facebook is the social media that lot of people use in sub-Saharan Africa. The way they use it, seems to be more diversified and intensive than in Europe for instance. Other social media like twitter have a much lower audience in sub-Saharan Africa. So we use Facebook as an important collaborative platform in Coeur d'Or, with the risks that you mentioned including spams. The facilitation team has a critical role to cure the wall of the group. This team has to approve all the primary posts, but can not approve comments before their publication. The team has, however, to be vigilant to remove all the inappropriate comments regularly. Private birthday posts are treated as not alway treated as inappropriate. We tolerate them some time for active members as a mean to reward them and to sustain their motivation to collaborate more in the group. 4- Offline events. We realized early in our learning process in the group, that online presence alone is not going to help us reaching our goals. We organize collaboratively offline events: physical activities (walks), risk factors screening, interactive conferences and workshops. All those events are organized by members of the group. We use the online tools to recruit members who want to collaborate in the organization. We share with them some key principles and support. We use the online tools as well for advertisement of the events. The access to all the physical event is free of charge. We use a collaborative process to raise the funding, using members of the group that has skills and key positions in potential funding structures. By doing so, we were capable of raising up to 25000 dollars in 2015 to organize physical events. This is happening in a context where the ministry of health do not have any internal budget for this kind of event. The local representation of WHO makes about 2000 dollars only available for this kind of event. In the organization of those offline events, community members hold a lot of power in the process.We still have a lot to learn, about this experience. Thanks for your attention. I'm very interested in learning from your reactions, analyses, and suggestions.Thank you for being here with me.
Somewhere people were calling for money to buy food to be distributed on poor people during the Ramadan. I can't see how do you waste food. Do you cook food, eat and through the remaining away instead of storing it in the fridge for next day?
I am researching the alternative economics initiatives to hold an event to experiments the different concepts here in Cairo. I was fascinated by the use of alternative currencies in some communities in Brazil and had the chance to meet someone from Banco de Bem. I basically have many things that I am interested to sell or donate. It has been 3 years since I started to reduce my belonging starting by donating more than half my wardrobe, old functioning computer, extra blanket, etc. Now I want to make some money, can exchange some items for other and donate a few. I started gardening. I planted zuccinis and pumpkins, have herbs and trying to expend :) I am interested in your initiative. I can open another discussion to get ideas for my event. What are the tools known as alternatives to the current economic system? Examples from around the globe? What should I be experimenting and spreading awareness through practice? How? I feel a little bit confused unable to cluster or organise these concepts: - Bartering - alternative currencies - BitCoin - Gift Economy - Swap - LETS etc. Finally what Oasis Game are you talking about? I am in. Dina
Hi @steelweaver, Just to thank you for the contribution and to say I'm intrigued by what it means that you're operating while waiting for a license, is it dangerous or do you risk anything? Or is it more a matter of time.. and you will get it anyway, be in the books etc? Ever since we heard about the volunteers led clinic in suburban Athens and the potentially many similar ones, it makes you wonder what it is about these grey areas in between formality and informality. Maybe involving people who are not health professionals in the system definition is a requisite for the kind of services you mention - precisely because the ones from the system are too trapped in it to get out alone. 
Like @Carolina, I am interested, mostly in the traveling tour. @noelito pointed me years ago to a project by European Alternatives called TransEuropa Caravans where a group would go from place to place to meet initiatives and work out storytelling formats for connecting them. See this video as example:This wasn't moneyless though, and probably costs a lot of time and work. and only as a starting and learning point. We tried network building last year in Bucharest with a project called Futurespotters -wasn't food related but it was also about getting people who are very much aligned in values and agree on a lot of things that need to be solved, to meet each other and collaborate. But then a lot of other things are needed to make a network be self-supporting as you say (not sure if it can though), I don't even know where to start - leadership, vision, headspace to get out of your own bubble and hyper localized projects -there are so many great initiatives out there doing good. Someone once said to me that they're actually meant to be small, informal, cheap, and operating at any other scale would ruin it.This said, food sharing and looking at reducing waste sounds like it's part of the future, I dont see anyone here disagreeing, so you're on to something..! 
I just wanted to quickly express my thanks to @Sam_Muirhead for making this video. I really really like it, the people in it and also the animation, you've gotten better and better at this! 
Hello Alberto, nice to meet you too! „But I guess what annoys you is that you do not agree with the idea of success that mainstream society is promoting. In that case, the first move is probably to accept it, and decide you are going to measure yourself in some other way.“ Exactly! Thanks for your ideas and input. I think that your idea of changing my own perception on success and failure is really a good starting point. But it is a piece of a much more complex puzzle, I guess. Building communities of like-minded people sounds good, too, and I see how the unMonastery project contributes to that. Maybe one could also find a way to promote an alternative vision for society within „mainstream culture“, whatever this is... 
Good morning, @Paul Free, I'm totally in! :)I really liked the way you approach this issue, starting with traditional economics basis and then ending in something more like socia/ecological/inclusive economics and global welfare. 
The Foodsharing idea (https://project.yunity.org/about_foodsharing in English) just makes so much sense. I am not completely sure we can classify it as "care", though. But perhaps it's not even  that important. @Paul Free, I know there are plans of community (vegetable) gardening as part of the city of Galway's bid to become European Capital of Culture 2020. This is led by the Transition Town people in town. @Noemi and @NiallOH know more about this. Should we put you in touch? 
Agree with @melancon. And don't get me started about food culture in Italy, which is strictly regional rather than national. Northern Europeans seem to make less of a big deal of it, though. 
As a former North American (left 25 years ago), I keep being flaggerblasted by how much food links people in France. Everywhere in France. I guess this is a country where everyone has a very personal perspective on how "blanquette de veau" should be made and is ready to debate about it even with the president of France.Food market is where you go not only for food, but to meet people. In my village, the Saturday morning market deploys its fantasies before a magnificent mixed style Roman-Gothic Cathedral with teraces filled with people chatting and laughing. The Saturday market is is a favorite meeting point. Going to the market is the supreme alibi to act as a "cigale" (it's only now I realize there is no english translation for this word ...), enjoy the sun and spend time with friends. This is where you go to distribute flyers and mobilize people for your evening concert, or politicians distribute tracts and shake hands to get reelected, ...The evening my wife delivered my daughter, we were discussing wine tastings with the obstetrician. The thing French people bring back from the place they visited on vacation: food, to share it with others.And do you know what French people talk about when they share a good meal: food, remembering the meal and wines they tasted together the last time ... I am ready to believe Germans prefer chatting about the weather. The French also talk about the weather, debating on how it will affect the harvest and quality of the next "millésime" ... :-)
So, here's what I'm hearing. We organize a call for the "Edgeryders DroneTech Instant Group". You introduce. We discuss use cases. The output is some form of documentation. The EDTIG gains a small stake in your entry, to be formalized and quantified in and when. When could that be? Early next week OK? (BTW, at LOTE we got friendly with two young Romanian aerospace engineers who are doing a stage of sorts at Euro Control... might be useful, and they are nice people). Also: do we go off platform? How public are you comfortable with being?
Just as I had finished reading you post  @Cindy_P. this piece of news floated past my feeds:
They also have a different market position, in-house capability, and thus motivations. On top of that the amazon drone skit is highly effective advertising (6M views) for people who don't chuckle at the drone performance pictured there (which is also just a placeholder of course).
Up to the last bullit you are pretty much correct.Not exactly a white canvas session but it is early stage none the less. I already have a very specific use case in mind. But it is a tickly one. I would like to push it with @ElaMi5 and perhaps one or two people from EdgeRyders who can attest that this is not completely bonkers and makes some sense (from their experience, and also so we don't completely rely on the UN to push this). It is out of competition for the ongoing challenge though. That challenge just sparked the idea. The idea does not threaten any business field of Airbus and they could use it as a test case to see if they actually can get more agile.Other story:If Edgeryders were to help me with my current entry in the challenge (e.g. through illustration, or something I can't think of right now) - and I make a lot of monies. Then I would be very happy to fork some back. They have 3 categories including community prize, I don't think "storming the election process" would be fair - even though it would be easy money with 10k$ for the first prize. The other prizes are considerably more substantial.@johncoate : I'll answer here if that is okay. Airbus is a organizational dinosaur that has existed with no real predators going after it for decades. It is afraid that natural selection will soon ring its doorbell. They can see the future markets shifting to their disadvantage and realize they probably have to re-invent themselves. This drone challenge is only a placeholder (even though it is one of the actual threats to many of their products). It could also be the move to electric aviation for example. It is probably just as much a test case for implementing different info flow/process architectures
Other than it being non-commercial.http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011 
@trythis, you'll have to walk me through this. Let's see if I got it right:You already submitted an entry, and are now looking for use cases"Use cases" is shorthand from "plausible revenue models". Use a drone for something, get paid as a function of the value of that something.You are thinking about use cases in disaster relief and development in general, as per this thread.So, you would like a brainstorming session with (a) a few Edgeryders; (b) someone from Local Motors, that you have already identified; (c) someone smart from the dev sector. Is this right?Suppose we do come out with 2-3 plausible use cases. What happens next?What does success look like? For you, for Edgeryders, for the people we involve?Sorry, all of this is probably obvious to you, but remember we have never remotely done this before. 
Thanks, @Alberto. Couldn't agree more about the conveyer-belt paradigm of mainstream medicine. Acupuncturists who have tried to work in the NHS have been similarly frustrated to the doctors - more, in fact, as their treatment is so individualised.But as the era of individualised medicine gathers steam, this is something that all forms of healthcare are going to have to grapple with.2 months is an extremely long time (2 weeks would be more usual). I won't bore you with the details, but essentially, acupuncturists are licensed at the local level in the UK alongside tattooists and body piercers (which have far greater risks of injury, blood-borne contamination, etc, and are, clearly, not any kind of healthcare) - and are thus entirely at the mercy of whatever inappropriate regulations the district council chooses to impose.As I said, the knock-on effects are common to any such grassroots community project - but I do think that there is a particular momentum that comes from the project delivering a treatment that directly makes people feel emotionally and physically better;and, of course, the community clinic model is unique to acupuncture because you can't treat multiple patients at once with most other modalities!
@Matthias and @Natalia SkoczylasI've submitted an entry to a design challenge over at local motors (also warrants a visit for they technical platform implementation):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iznBFghD4oIt is a design for a civil drone. I've been going through likely use cases now and in the future for a while, and there is one in particular that I would like to discuss with you guys and ideally Millie. I've already contacted her and gave her a heads up. This is relatively tight deadline (26 days left). If you would be open for a group call, I'd like to proceed as follows:Pick a tiny team of EdgeRyders with complementary skills and creds, find the right person at LM - probably Florian Feise, and the right person or two within UN/NGO scene (Milie +?), sit down together and build a very rough scenario / 80-20 business case that has just enough detail to get a Letter of Endorsement from the next higher level, and with that knock on Airbus' door.If you (anyone) is interested in what this is about, and would like to help please get in touch with me. I don't feel comfortable plastering this all over the web at this stage, but it is not a state secret. Also it has nothing to do with military applications.Lastly, while I was browsing around local motors I thought that there could be a good bit of symbiosis & learning from each other going on between the two communities. So if someone of you talks with Alberto anyway, perhaps you could mention this to him. Local Motors could really use someone who knows networks and communication patterns. On the other hand they've been around for a good while and could probably give Alberto some pointers on mentoring possibilities.
Inspiring, @KiraVde and @ivan (welcome back to both of you!). But I don't think it's quite that simple. "Being different", going by a different value system, is itself entropic. Here's why: to accomplish anything, we humans need other humans. Other humans are attracted by "successful" (as per the dominant canon of what "successful" means). Moreover, we suffer from a documented psyhological bias called the halo effect, that makes us assume that success trasfers across domains. If you are a successful marathon runner, I will rate higher your chances of starting a viable company, even though the skills involved with running marathons are not the same ones needed to run a business. People will help more gladly others when they think they are winners. By doing so, they will increase the chances of success of these perceived winners. So, being perceived as successful increases your chances of actually being successful. That's not to say you cannot define your own measure of success. But it does mean this is a lot easier when done in tribes. If you inhabit a cluster of the global social graph that goes by different rules, you are kind of OK being different, because your social network is also different, and that means you can mobilize those people to help in whatever it is you are doing. You can enjoy a reasonable measure of social esteem, even if it is localized in your corner of the graph. An unfortunate consequence of this is that, the more different you want to be, the more energy you need to invest promoting yourself. The message is "look at me, I am not a failure, I am a success by my own measure". Social media are full of this, often cloaked in hyper-individualistic narratives, of the "I quit my day job to follow my dream" type. Which is ironic, because hyper-individualists (if they exist) do not care about what people on Facebook think of them. Self-promotion is, in my opinion, the expression of a deep need for social acceptance. 
Hi Jean-Paul, a warm warm welcome to Edgeryders, we didn't have a chance to meet in Brussels last Feb I think.Impressive indeed, how many community organisers are needed to cater for a group of >21000?What I like most about your initiative is that you organise offline gatherings like the walk, and I'm curious how they work, if you learn new stories. For example, some people here in the community mentioned how for them health- or social care is about reciprocity: People help other people in need and receive help when the time comes when they need it. Do you know how the people in your group relate to care? Is it a service or more a commmunity that they are part of?Thanks again!
.. Hi @Jasen Lakic thank you for your candidness. and welcome back, it's been a while since Brussels! I think there is somewhere a click one must do even to say: "i'll stop and think and find myself" as you said you did.. and that moment is so relative that a lot of the time you don't recognize it and think that maybe you should push yourself a little more because the problem is in something you're doing wrong.  Unless you have gurus around you who can push you into that realisation. Did any of you try seeing a therapist at any point? Or @ivan, did anyone advise or help you get to a strategy of taking better care of yourself?  (btw nice to see you back as well!)
Hello friends,Very interesting topic and quite a common problem as well i believe. I will share with you few things in hope it is beneficial :).Haven't felt depression in years, sadness very rarely and short termed. I believe sadness comes from our inability to accept a certain situation, our resistence to it. If there is a situation we don't like we have only two choices: Accept it as it is or change it or at least try to change it. In both situations we shouldn't be depressed. If de did all in our power and failed to change it, we should be satisfied with ourselves and accept the outcome, since there is no alternative. However i do believe once sadness comes we should not try to supress it, let it run its course because anything else would be commiting violence upon our own nature and sadness would still manifest itself somehow.Good at school, always calm and good kid, inventive, reading since i was 5, playing chess since my 6th year...i can't really tell how many times i heard my family members say this dreadful phrase to their children: "just take Jasen's example, can't you be like him". Than i was 27, married, hated my job, didn't love my wife, i was miserable and had a lot of health issues. I started wondering: "how did i end up right here at this moment in life?" I knew i totally went off my path but didn't yet realise how or where is my path. After realising the community in which i grew up actually applied huge subconscious pressure on me through their projections of myself, through their expectations especially, and that so many of my life's actions were led by those thoughts in my head which were not really my thoughts. (i actually got married because everyone was telling me it's the right time and after some time it made sense...how crazy!).My next step was selfexploration, i had to get to know myself. I stayed at home reading books for months, Carlos Castaneda's books were an amazing discovery at that time. I went into nature for periods of isolation where i spent my time in silence and thought, and finally after some time i started meditating. As far as success is concerned i agree with Alberto. Should we measure ourselves in comparison to others or by finding our own system of values and definition of success? For example i have 0 debt, built my own house by the age of 28, a good car and pretty much anything i need materially now...most of my friends think i am succesful. I would however consider myself succesful if i could succeed in creating a well balanced family full of love and respect, or if i could be nothing but a positive and inspiring experience for anyone who meets me. Or if i could attain permanent state of meditation for example. Also i have been with many women, and ofcourse friends i went out with always considered me lucky or succesful with women. Well again my definition of success is very different: i would have preferred to stay with the first one i loved...or with any i loved. Now, in retrospective i rather think i failed miserably with some of those women and brought really bad kharma on me through those "successes" :).
I feel your plea, and as @KiraVde says I also wish I would not give too many fucks.Myself, I am afraid of taking things easy and slowing down, because I feel that if I am not going forward I am going backwards (by whatever standard!) and.. what if I stopped caring? That scares me the most I guess.At the same time I see a spiritual path in finding new ways of changing yourself to overcome challenges. I see these situations like signals telling me to adapt and find a new way to fit better. Saying that, the best strategy I have found up to now is to try to be rested, eat well, exercise, pursue some hobby and be happy. In exactly that order. As you build up energy the number of fucks given dramatically decreases and you are psychologically more resiliant. Sometimes very resiliant. The really hard thing for me is to realize when I am eating too much into my energy and I can become tired, grumpy, worried, overworked.. and then fearful without even realizing I am getting there. So, when you are there.. just press reset and rebuild your energy, then much of the fears of failing and checklists will just evaporate.
Hello @steelweaver, welcome back! It's been a while. I am not sure about acupuncture as such. On the other hand, I am very intrigued by what your model adds to acupuncture. You add:Humane treatment. On this I have to disagree with Steven Novella. He says: "All good doctors are empathetic and patient-centered." And this is true, but it misses the point. Because most doctors work in systems which are not humane at all – and can't be, because they run on an industrial age paradigm. They derive efficiency from scale and standardization, and that requires patients are treated as production batches in manufacturing. Many doctors absolutely hate this, but it's the only game in town. Acupuncture is out of this system, and therefore it can afford to at least try to be humane. Collective treatment and destigmatization. No brainer.Affordability – always a good thing.It seems to me these are tenets of anything we can rightfully call open care. Another interesting data point you have found is about licensing and regulation. Is two months a long time to get a license in the UK? If so, what do you think is going on, and how could it be fixed?(I don't buy knock-on effects really, because you'd have them also if you administered any other treatment than acupuncture (as well as not delivered in the patient's home). 
Welcome, @jdossou80@yahoo.com. And congratulations! Coeur d'Or seems like an impressive achievement. I wandered a bit within the group (also applied to join). It has all the glory and the traps of Facebook itself: super-easy to join (and that helps your numbers), very mobile-friendly, but also difficult to sort out, with important content mixed with personal stuff like birthday parties and  even spam (as I write this, someone calling themselves "Marcel Enyonam" is offering cheap loans on about ten posts).My main question is: do you get people exchanging about their experiences as patients (or perhaps care givers, like parents or adult children of patients)? How do they collaborate, and on what? I scrolled down a while, but I did not find much. But then, I am not a power user of Facebook, maybe it's just me :-) 
Hi guys!One time I sat in grand écart position for 48 hours so that I could join the pro gym team. Just to illustrate: I'm very disciplined and am applying to be Tina's new best friend. But the latest skill that I've been training is to do nothing. The saying goes that a little hard work never killed anyone, but after a burn-out and a crushed nerve at my young age, I'm not prepared to take the risk.When the going gets tough and I feel guilty about my time spend doing non-productive things, I remind myself of two things.One: when you look at discovery channel, animals don't spend all their time chasing. Most of it is just lying in the sun. No judgement necessary.Two: doing nothing is very rebelious these days. Why think of myself as a lazy-ass when I can think of myself as bad-ass?On the question of how to help people to cope with expectations they can't and don't want to meet -  I think it's something we each do for ourselves. Personally I draw a lot of inspiration from people who don't give too many fucks. So I try to be that person, too.
Just to add to @Alberto's last point: one of the most useful things about the paradigm of Traditional Chinese Medicine is that it can also be applied to food-as-medicine - without requiring a spare decade to study nutritional science!A patient given a diagnosis (e.g. 'Excess metal constricting the breathing', or 'jing deficiency') can be treated with acupuncture and herbs, but can also adapt their diet to help reinforce those effects (e.g. eating more spicy food to open the lungs, or eating more dense, proteinous foods).I understand this is fairly common practice in China, where the terms of the medical paradigm are well-established in everyday life and language.Relevant to: the story I just posted on community acupuncture.
Very interesting, @Ezio Manzini! Here's the money quote: In principle, everybody can care for someone else [...] in different forms [...], but all of them require attention. Given that attention is a limited resource [...] care [...] is [also] a diffuse but limited resource. This vision of care activities reminds me of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is quite a coherent object. It's also very decentralized in scope and authorship; and tasks are allocated across contributors by self-selection, without central control.Contributors are extremely diverse in their interests, experience, and in the time they contribute to Wikipedia. Some Wikipedians, like me, might fix a typos or repair a broken link here or there, and only very occasionally enter a factual information. Others take full stewardship for entries that are important to them. Others, still, make tens of edits a day. A lot of Wikipedia's advantage comes from the fact that it can use effectively small contributions. Open care might be the same. A mature open care ecosystem, I propose, is one where the natural human impulse to care and help can be easily translated into a contribution. One, in other words, where, if you can only contribute 30 minutes, you can, and your contribution will make a small, but tangible difference. Works? 
Thanks for sharing this @HoneyMk, I was very impressed by Philipp's grandparents story (is he @makerphil?), which tells things so many of us experienced, albeit not to the same degree.. my family had to take care for 5 years of my grandmother, who also suffered from dementia.She was lucky because she had a large family and they all shouldered this, but for the two people who lived side by side with her it was immensely difficult. I don't know if it has to do with the medical infrastructure in a place, but where I come from it's always the family who takes care of ill members, never long term professional services, mostly out of duty and love.You say you don;t know how it has affected your life,  but maybe you know how it has affected your mom's life? To give you an idea, my family was so unprepared to cope with this that the new roles they were finding themselves in completely messed up the family. It had to do with matriarchal/ patriarchal figures not being so present anymore and then younger ones having to cope with a ton of things and make decisions that they felt unprepared for. A takeaway point from your story: love and laughter, the authentic ones, make for an important variable in any care relationship, just to keep that in mind.
@Cindy P. are you looking to gather more projects about food? Should other people here in the community help by pointing you to interesting initiatives?Ideally whenever you post a story make sure include a note asking for help, that helps others jump in with something you actually need :-)
Well, hard to disagree with what you write here. I am curious about the practice of care, though. What does it look like for you? How do you personally give and receive care? Is it babysitting for a friend? Is it spending time with a sick relative? How does that experience influence your views?
Hello and welcome @Cindy P. Thanks for these reflections. They make a ton of sense not only to me, but, it seems, to a lot of people.It brings people together. During LOTE5 (we had a workshop called Collaborative Inclusion, you would have liked it It think) we learned about a project in Belgium called DineWithUs. Elizabeth, the lady who started it, said: "Once a migrant has been processed and is "legalised" in Belgium there remains a wall between Belgians and newcomers. I was personally frustrated that I did not know any of them, and all my friends were white. Our idea is pretty simple, just share a meal, learn recipes and teach your own. We have now over 100 registrations, it's working OK but we need to grow."It has direct consequences on health – it is, in fact, health care. I recently learned that a medical school in the US started giving cooking classes to its students. The key person is a man called Tim Harlan, "who is both a doctor and a chef", and heads something called The Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine. Theirs is an open care initiative, I think, because they teach mediacal students, doctors and the local community to cook in a tasty and healthy way. This way, they are making patients into caregivers (because patients cook too!) and even inventing a new shared language whith which doctors and patients can talk about health. "We are not talking about nutrition: we are talking about food."  
@Milan Siegers thanks for keeping us updated. Curious, how do you go about finding answers? Do you go into academic literature or more practical surveying, or..?   A friend of mine, expat living in Cluj, has similar questions to yours and he's starting to design a project with psychology students: to bring people in town of different ethnicity, ages and occupations together in meaningful socializing, because everyone is so into their own clique. The proposition is to just give themselves an opportunity to meet new people, no strings attached for a couple hours? Basically they will run events branded as such - "you should spend time with strangers, it's healthy and fun".It's nice because it starts with a personal burning point and doesn't pretent it will find answers. Needing to find answers can be scary sometimes :-)
Hi @Cindy P., are you working with @Luisa by any chance? I see she has posted an almost identical challenge. Also, @makerphil was asking something similar and I offered an example of a (public) happening and eyecontact experiment.How can we, others in the community, help? 
How can learn people in this society to be tolerant and patient with others. These are characteristics that I see missing for example in the context of design.
Hi Alberto I think people who stay react badly to people on the move basically because they did not have the same experience to go far away from home and rebuild a home in other place, the most of this people were always in the same place, maybe because this place was very comfortable for them. they are people who maybe do not want to leave the comfort zone and take risk. So they can´t understand people on the move because they maybe didn´t try go on the move. The other reason maybe that people who stay living very well in this comfort zone and are afraid that people are coming can interfere in this zone. They are afraid to the unknown. The question maybe be is how can lose the fear to the unknown in this society? and What can bring people together ?
Really hard one: We have a flag over our head, marking our belonging to a certain group of people with common "values", the first one being same nation based on tradition/culture, language and everything else (while in fact the flag only marks the territory owned by a certain power structure). Then the bigger group of religion and even bigger group of race. We have been conditioned to think in certain patterns (mostly as means of control and achieving power by few) and great majority of people don't have time/will to question all those things. Not even counting that, just take into consideration collective history, how many bad past experiences have their been? We Europeans have destroyed and dominated every other culture we encountered in our "benign attempts to civilise them"(if we had means to do so). All those things are big obstacles, it will take a loooooong time i believe before we undo several thousands of years working against us.The only way to truly build bridges between communities is to  have them work together, eat together, talk and exchange knowledge about each other. (even then you might get an incredible reaction like "hey Mohamed is such a nice guy...FOR a Morrocan", so one stops regarding him as a foreigner but  he stays an exception, he is UNLIKE those others :).All those divisions are totally unnatural if you ask me, in fact it is beneficial for human species to mix as much as possible, greater mixture of genes leads naturally to better results and greater mixture of cultures/difference of experiences is of immense value.I dont really have a flag above my head, i am a human and i believe all humans have equal value but it took me years to realize that and bear in mind i question everything, even my own actions, thoughts, feelings. So maybe travelling inwards might solve issues as well? Asking important questions to ourselves or others like: Why do i keep distance from this person? What is the origin of my fear, mistrust, why am i judgemental? Again, how does one accept the idea that he/she is wrong in some fundamental ways? Ego is an obstacle :).
I am no expert, but I think you are on to something @lujia. This idea of everyone being simultaneously care giver and care receiver is the cornerstone of OpenCare. The commercial is cute too! 
Wow, thanks @lujia, this is really good insight. I had no idea this stuff was going on in China.I am particularly interested in the conflictual relationship between doctors and patients. This could be a very serious drag on the system. Liability laws, even when they are well-meaning, end up disincentivizing doctors to intervene, especially on cases that are serious and desperately need help. One of my uncles, a gynaecologist in New York, once told me that his liability insurance was far and away his highest cost, and that patients would sue for absolutely anything. In America, you can sue for astronomically high sums, because they have a legal insititution called punitive damage. If somebody causes you trouble, you can sue not only to recover the costs of the damage done, but also to "punish" the offender. Punishment depends on subjective evaluation of the offense, i.e. on how deeply you have been made unhappy by the offense: the more unhappy, the more money you can demand. Unsusrprisingly,  most people say they are very unhappy, and demand a lot of money.In this situation, he explained, if you see a woman with a potentially troubled pregnancy, you'd better stay the hell away from her. If you try to treat her and she or the baby have issues, she'll sue you into a smoking hole. But if you don't touch her, then you are good. Of course, she might suffer from lack of treatment, and that's too bad but not really your problem. But doctors, mostly, choose this career because they want to heal patients, so some (including my uncle) buy expensive insurance and carry on. Eventually the premiums rose so high that he just decided to go out of business. In Europe, this problem is less exacerbated, also because we do not have punitive damage. What is the situation like in China? Can you tell us more about these "professionals"? Do you know of any community-based responses, like this one in Greece? 
Hi Pauline, First of all, I am very happy to know that one of my classmates has been to my country and lived there for so long! Secondly, please trust me when I say I totally understand how much trouble and frustration you and your family might have faced. I have studied in the USA for over six years now, and it was very difficult for me in the beginning. However, at least America is organized and has more serious regulations. On the other hand, China is this crazy place with things that I don't even know how they work XD. The healthcare system and medicine and food safety are two of the most serious issues that is occuring in China right now (along with hundreds of other ones...). If you think about it, China is a country that is both old and young. Modern medicine, science, social structure, and etc didn't become a thing until very recent in the history. The China now was established in 1949, and after that the country went through a four-year famine and a ten-year cultural revolution. By the beginning of 1980s, the entire country was behind on technology, education and many other things. Medicine -- a crucial area  -- unfortunately brought harm to many people due to the doctors' lack of professional knowledge. Many people in my generation, including one of my best friends, suffer hearing loss because of antibiotics over-use. I have a permenant arm injury myself because of the improper obstetrics practice. Today, the relationship between the doctors and the patients are super intense in China. The patients and their families would blame everything on the doctors and the hospitals if they think they are not treated "correctly". There are even groups of so called "professionals" who are paid by the patients' families to make a mess at the hospital: break things and even physically harm the doctors. I am not quite sure exactly how this works, but it seems to me that Chinese doctors like giving the patients all kinds of pills. It is very common in China to see a doctor just for a common cold, and you would recieve medicine for that (I never took anything when I was sick in America). People say that the doctors recieve benefits from giving medicine, but don't mark my words on this. I can definetly do more research later. And then, there is the question of how safe the drugs and vaccine in some places are. But I'm afraid that is out of my knowledge. I'm not sure if any of this information is helpful. But one thing for sure, it is not just because you and your family are foreigners that getting a treatment is confusing and frustrating, it is becasue the entire system is a mess, even for locals like me. Lujia
Hi Dennis,My comment has little to do with refugees, but this project I did last semester back in New York was about the relationship between the provider and the receiver as well. The area I focused on was disability. I interviewed a few people on the street who were in a wheelchair, and did a half day experiment rolling myself in a wheelchair. It was quite an experience I have to say. I suddenly found myself shorter than everyone else -- both physically and psychologically. Many people offered me help, and of course I told them the truth, but I felt if I were really disabled, I wouldn't simply say yes because I wouldn't want to trouble others and would want to be as independent as possible. On the other hand, when I see a handicapped person, and a few of my classmates agreed on this, sometimes I am not sure if I should help him/her because I don't want to assume that they can't perform certain actions and offend them. As time goes on, I realize the unbalance in the relationship between the abled and the disabled. The abled is always the benefit provider and the disabled is always the benefit receiver. Hence, this automatically, like you mentioned, "belittled" the handicapped. Therefore I began to think some solutions that can make the disabled offer something back so that the relationship between these two group could be even. We didn't spend much time on this project so my answer to my question might sound cheesy.  I focused on wheelchair only, and added a heart-rate monitor on the handle so that the person who pushes the wheelchair could use that time to work out. Here is the link to the commercial I made for the product. Hope this gives you some inspirations :).  https://vimeo.com/142760828Lujia
Thanks @CommonFutures, good tip. I'd like to get in touch with them. Unfortunately, the "health" link from that page to a more detailed breakdown of the services offered is broken (http://salut.cooperativaintegral.cat/), and it there does not seem to be another from the home page of CIC. Do you know them personally? 
Welcome, @Charles_M_Lines. I agree. When this kind of collaboration kicks in, the whole evaluation model collapses. Helliniko is not an improvement on existing provision models: it is radically different from them, and uncomparable to them. But what do you mean by "skilled and well placed partners who are willing and able to act as brokers within the system to get things done"? Do you have any example in mind?
This is an extremely interesting development which shows how collaboration is evolving at pace before our eyes: social media and internet driven; bottom up and middle outwards rather than top down; redefining value, cost and currency; beginning to redefine what is acceptable, allowed and treated as 'legal'; finding and using not only skilled partners but also skilled and well placed partners who are willing and able to act as brokers within the system to get things done. 
Hi Dennis,We see this same problem with many of the short term volunteers in Calais.A lot of very well meaning people want to come to 'help' and 'care', but they act in a way that robs the people they want to help of their agency; their freedom to act normally.When i first started working on the camp i fell into the same trap. I was helping to build shelters, but i was also a little scared for myself: my safety, my equipment, 'getting the job done correctly'. It was only by standing back from the action and just talking to some of the camp residents who were trying to help us that i found out more about them. Many of them had been engineers or builders before they embarked on their journey to a safer life.I realised that these people were more qualified than i was, had more reason to make sure the shelter was built well and could be trusted with our equipment because it was of great value to them that we had brought it to the camp.I had to turn off the switch in my head that was about 'me' and truely be there for them. But it could only be done by firstly opening a dialogue, then through mutual understanding and cooperation.As the day went on the residents who were working with us drifted away (to do tasks like cooking, eating, prayer, preparation for the nighttime, talking to family at home/friends in other countries) and we found ourselves continuing the work as our orginal team. That was the moment that we really started to help them. We could treat this task as a job, we could committ 100% of our time and resources to finishing the job quickly, because that's why we had come out there. As a result 16 people had a drier, warmer place to sleep that night.But we could have walked on site, dropped all the materials and equipment off and sat drinking chai and talking to the residents for the whole afternoon whilst they built the shelters themselves and we would have been just as helpful, just as caring, just as useful to the people.People first, mission second.
Welcome back, @trythis. Well, I am way out of my depth. But will help as I can, of course. How can we help? Would you like a dedicated community call, see who's out there who can pool skills? Anything else?
Hi @Pauline, Since you're into family care I thought Alberto's post about 3 adult couples going into an alternative living situation together might help. They are doing this as a personal project and a way of tweaking their own needs. Here it is, let us know if you want to connect to other people who have experienced this or new models, as a way to go deeper into your design.I don't know if this is about family per se anymore. Most often I hear about initiatives where you have supplementary support offered to a group - through projects that are services, like co-work/ living spaces for mobile travellers (although it doesnt get to solving the deeper care problem).A more interesting movement I keep coming across is around downshifting and how that redefines the way we relate to the very idea of family and connections - the latest I've read about is @vvorski's idea of smart villages, let me know if this is interesting for you:Ultimately, what we crave are more meaningful moments and life-experiences; more time to spend following our curiosity. Time to build nourishing relationships and friendships. Time to enjoy the simple things in life and really experience the world. Time to be present with our loved ones, our friends, acquaintances and the strangers we meet along the way. Yet too often our jobs starve us of what is most precious — the time and space to express who we truly are — social, curious, playful and purposeful humans. [..]We believe that there is a growing demand for smart villages where we can design our ideal balanced lives. Places where we can live in harmony with nature. We can create a safe and happy home for our families. And we don’t have to sacrifice our careers and dreams to make this happen. We can continue to build and participate in virtual companies, occasionally travelling to cities for important meetings or conferences.
It's so sad to see that there is no way to move beyond that. And yet you hear stories like this school built by a Nigerian: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35714129 It's probably fragile and temporary though (if still there), but good example.

Very clear, thanks @Alex_Levene.
Interesting - thanks - another example which might be worth a look: http://cooperativa.cat/en/cooperative-public-system/health/ 
Some of the facilities and services on camp are staffed and operated my residents of the camps. Both the Ashram Kitchen (link above) and the Jungle books use people from the camps to organise (cook, clean, serve, staff etc) their operations. Some parts of it a situated in specific areas of the camp and the people who live close to those amenities operate as security and safety overnight.It's very much a case that the residents are very active on site. Whenever organisations start to build additional shelters, or do maintenance/repairs the locals get heavily involved. At the moment we aren't allowed to bring large-scale building material onto the site so resourceful communities and individuals are doing a lot of self building using scavenged wood and tarpualin/waterproof fabrics. There are lots of skilled people on the camps, some of them have been engineers, large scale construction workers so us volunteers are always happy to bring equipment, hand it out and then stand back and let the professionals handle the work.It is probably true to say that there aren't any refugee-led projects on site, or if there are, i am not aware of them yet. It's certainly something i could find out more about by asking around.My view is that most people living on the camp consider it to be a temporary pit stop before they get to the UK (even if it's 'temporary' for 9 months or more) and so aren't keen on setting up services long term on the camp when they could be in a lorry tomorrow night heading to Britain. Longer term residents who are more settled in the camp and are looked at as community leaders do a lot more than i am aware of, but in order to find out more about what they were doing to support each other it would be really benefitial to have a few translators who could have more detailled conversations with them. It's those guys who are the real heroes of the story. The volunteer workforce are just smiling, friendly couriers really.
Thanks Luce for reporting on the successfull submission of deliverable 2.1It's not as if I did not know about it :-) I added a few words myself to the accompanying document. I invite all to have a look, the few additions I made to Nadia and Alberto's text aimed at facilitating the work of reviewers: helping them to get the idea, identify the relevant resources and in this case easily access them on the web.
WP2, Deliverable 2.1: Deployed, tested OpenCare online space on the production server - SUBMITTED :)A copy of the document is stored under the OpenCare Admin file, see Deliverables.
Hey people interested in co-creation:There is a drone-challenge for a civil application out now. It has just started, more info:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iznBFghD4o
I am not convinced about this particular choice I have made - in fact, I am mostly deeply irritated during these debates.But it helps me escape the bubble I live in, inhabited by people that agree with each other. Though, I am still pretty far from understanding why they think what they think. 
This is a great story! What it seems to have to teach is this: refugee camps could sprout many more and better services if people were allowed to provide for each other. Score one for self organization.However, from what I read I have the impression that this is a story about the volunteers. It is them (you!) doing all this amazing stuff. Are refugees themselvesd involved in building and staffing these services and efforts? 
@Natalia Skoczylas your story reminded me of something and now I'm wondering. I decided not to break a friendship when I saw a (rather distant) friend of mine was a supporter of a right wing extremist social group on facebook. I guess, like Alberto explains above, I was giving up on any possibility to change their mind. The fact of the matter is, and I've tested it before, that you can't beat emotional arguments with rationality. Honestly, that feels like a dead end. But maybe one still needs to at least make a case before deciding to tolerate attitudes around you that go deeply against your owns. Mea culpa.
Oh, this is familiar. I've read so many stories on Edgeryders where young people ask this very same questions, myself included.  Then what helped me was spending time with others and realising that we're all in the same boat and this is not a personal dillemma, it's a collective one. Finding each other really gives you a sense of support, somehow it helped my mind get over the fact that there is a problem. Then things would only get easier in time, because you surround yourself with people who are like you - not only that they feel the same (most everyone does!) but that they talk about it in the same uncompromising way. What is your entourage like?Have you read @Dougald's piece? You'll love it.Oh an @Katja_Feldmeier, you should really talk to @NeleG, she touches on some similar questions in her post!
@Cindy, I was reading on your user profile about the support you get from the family you work for. Does this more positive experience reveal new approaches in your design? Or can those people on the "right" side of the debate also offer helpful insights? The advantage is that they can relate to both German peers and foreign peers, and so have more complete information. I would think they can become bridge builders in a solution design. 
I fully recognize myself -maybe a year back or so - in this picture. The advice I've been given is to learn first  to go easier on myself if I want or expect others to do the same. Like you say, practicing some sort of spiritual education helps. Supposedly it would also allow you to change the focus from the "professional" aspects to personal wellbeing and better self care to balance your life. The problem is that sometimes you can't do it alone, and shouldn't. So the challenge is finding those like minded communities which Alberto mentions and dreaming up solutions to make it better for more people. If you know of good projects do recommend, I'm very interested.This talk on vulnerability really hits the nail, I wholeheartedly recommend it, if you havent seen it already:
Hello @Cindy. Great to read about your discussion there. So, what's your conclusion? Why do people who stay react badly to people on the move? How do you think you can turn fear into trust? And is fear really the right word?
It comes down to this: patients need to actively cooperate with care givers for the system to work at all. As a Westerner in China, your patterns of cooperation did not match with those of the Chinese doctors and pharmacists. You could not collaborate effectively: a doctor would tell you "yes, try this" when they meant "I don't know" or "there's nothing that can be done". And you would not understand, and this would lead to misfiring and frustration. I can only imagine how much worse this is for people on the move in a less secure position: economic migrants, refugees etc. They must find Western carers (doctors, nurses, social workers) very hard to read.
Hello @NeleG, nice to meet you. Your reflection is recurring in Edgeryders. I guess this is a common thread to the people on the edge. For example, the unMonastery was in part a product of the need for finding one's own rhythm. It turned out to be very challenging, but at least it was not the usual challenge – it was a different one. My personal way to look at it is to draw inspiration from biology. In the natural world, there is no one but you to underwrite your pains. Even parasites have to be good at parasitism, or they will die as individuals or go extinct as a species. At the same time, a successful species in biology is definied as one well adapted to its ecological niche, not in terms of how close it is to to the top of the food chain. A frog is not a failed crocodile: it is a successful animal by its own yardstick. Put a crocodile in a European pond, he'll starve to death, whereas frogs do just fine. By the same token, it would be weird to say that a craftsman is a failed CEO! He is just not.We should not take the analogy too far, of course. But I guess what annoys you is that you do not agree with the idea of success that mainstream society is promoting. In that case, the first move is probably to accept it, and decide you are going to measure yourself in some other way. Maybe, then, it will not be a vulnerability at all that you do not like ticking boxes! In my experience, it helps to find communities of like-minded people, because it takes a lot of effort to be alone in upholding an alternative vision of society! 
Hello @dennis, welcome!You are  a designer – you tell me! I guess it starts by stripping ourselves and others of labels (I am a volunteer, you are a refugee, she is a person in need...) and decide we are all people, and we have got some job to do. If we do that, we can design the capacity of the people we are supposed to help into the action itself. For example, suppose that you want to erect a really large tent or an hexayurt in a refugee camp in Lesbos. How many people you need? If you think of the refugees as resource, you only need yourself to drive into the camp with the materials. Once there, you can ask for help, and chances are you'll find it! 
Unfortunately this dichotomy between provider/ receiver of services is still very common in the non-profit sector. Just look at how funding applications for initiatives supporting refugees are framed. It seems that the moment you define them as category in need- no matter the language variations, you have a problem already.Curious if our friends in Milano who are now doing many workshops to engage with groups in the city are seeing this kind of differentiation felt at the very level of individuals who are "in need" of care? Ping @zoescope @Alberto_Simonetti, as we were lately wondering how to frame discourse..
Hi @Pauline, a very interesting read, thanks for taking the time to upload your conversation. You're also pretty much the first edgeryders connection to China!I'm not sure I got it right (used Google translate): in your last paragraph you say that the medical system tends to behave same as the social, meaning that doctors treat patients using cultural language in addition to medical language - more scientifical language - and that makes it that sometimes treatments are less acurate? very interesting indeed.
Heya, thanks for the piece of thought. It reminded me of the story of Rete G2 shared by @Medhin Paolos some time ago about second generation migrants in Italy who were organising themselves at the grassroots level - although the movement was meant to advocate for their citizenship rights, it seemed to be equally so about building bridges. They  did so by producing cultural artifacts that illustrate at deeper levels issues of identity. Here's the story, although I'm curious how it's doing nowadays..  I find that food and arts are great equalizers in terms of making room for different identities to co-exist in a way that birthes new ones.
See you thursday in the call btw.
Hey Nadia,Shame not to see you as well. I'm sure i can fit aother visit in when you're around.Sorry this story isn't filled in properly yet, i've basically been writing massive proceedural documents for the camp people which has taken a lot of my time.I think i'm about half way through the full write up, so all things being well it should be on the site tonight. Fingers crossedAlex
As part of our outreach and engagement work, Edgeryders brokered an agreement with the College of Architecture, Media and Design at Berlin University of the Arts (UdK Berlin) around a new course in which we involve students in the OpenCare research project: http://hackingutopia.cre8tives.org/about/The agreement was finalised in mid february. While the website was already online by then as agreed, we decided to prioritise preparation of the course as an effective outreach and engagement opportunity and to finalise validation of the website design and contents based first experiences of using it as the primary collaboration, interaction and documentation space for the course activities. My documentation from the first day of the opening 4-day workshop: https://edgeryders.eu/en/you-and-me-and-everyone-we-know-the-many-faces-of-careThe Final exhibition has now been announced http://www.designtransfer.udk-berlin.de/en/projekt/hacking-utopia/Exhibition has now been announced here:  
Hello, @Alberto / @Noemi / @Nadia: I get back at you about the deliverable, again: we also have to justify our delay upon submitting it.I will therefore need you to explain in a paragraph why links to the OpenCare platform are submitted in in April instead of February (planned in the DoA).As I already posted, it sounds acceptable to explain that the platform was mainly ready in due time, that edgeryders introduced it during the kick-off by the end of February, with extra adjustments related to users' experiences being carried out in March. You also have to describe the impact this delay has on your activity as foreseen for WP2 (using more person-months, needing extra staff, or else).   
Hi Alex, how are you? Sorry to have missed your visit- just back  an hour ago after an intense week + in Berlin. Very curious to hear about your experiences and reflections. In part because I would like to volunteer this spring but am unsure as to where I can meaningfully put my skills etc to use. In part because both Ezio and myself are adamant that this should be one of thd focal points in opencare 
I'll double-check and submit it :)Thanks again, Luce
ping @LuceChiodelliUB as agreed yesterday.. hope it helps. I checked the links again and it seems they're all working, but won't hurt to have another couple of clicks when submitting, just to be sure.
Hello, As I see you keeping the wiki updated - just tell me when we are good to go with the delivery to the EC. Thanks ! :)
Thanks Noemi! I will look into it!!!
I was wondering too. The reason why comments are now disabled in the Meetups is to focus all conversations there on stories (Challenges page) with all the pages read-only for easy navigation by first time users..Ideally we post documentation after the events in our research group. This is still open for ideas, there's no best solution, what do you think?
Hi @Neolie, tough question! A case from Nepal where we did some work last year might help: change makers in that space were all motivated by the need to re-build their communities and help each other just after the earthquake, but from our team on the ground we learned that it in fact doesn't last long enough to make people keep on working to care for the greater picture. Intrinsic motivation seems to fail there, especially when the work is hard, unthankful, unpaid and mostly it doesn't solve people's personal needs - especially if those people are at Maslow's rock bottom.There are more insights from working in Nepal which might be of help to you. Here it is: Earthquakes create movements - but can we?
Hi @simon.messmer, thanks for sharing thoughts from your process. How's it coming along? Are you trying to design a project, or a product, or..?Good luck with your course!   
A very basic event which happened in a lot of cities over the last years, including where I live (Cluj) was to have hundreds of people - strangers - staring in each others eyes for one long minute, two by two. After that, one would stand, leave and go to sit with someone else. And so on. It was an interesting human connection experiment, although it mostly brought young people in.More about this and a video: https://inspiralight.wordpress.com/2015/06/21/the-touching-truth-behind-the-eye-contact-experiment/ 
Hi Phil,This sounds wonderful. Make sure you let ER community know when you are planning this to happen. I know i'd love to come along if i can.Alex
Hi, is it possible to allow comments to Meetups?Hi think that it's the right place to post question or comments about the Meetups! What do you think? @Nadia @Noemi
Hi @Noemi, do you think we need to create Meetups post also for past events?   
Hi @Cristina Martellosio - because this is part of community outreach activities I recommend posting it in Meetups on the community site.For reference, maybe the Guide we set up will help you in the use of the online environment
Added on the Op3nCare homepage! I guess I was expecting this wiki to reach more structure and consistency. If there are things we're missing or questions we should answer in it don't hesitate to add them.
https://edgeryders.eu/en/op3ncare-community/resourcesI have to admit I get them sort of mixed up.  But I can also see that if you go to the ER homepage, then click projects you can see the two choices.  But now I would say, given the importance of OC, why not put a discreet link to it righ there on the first page and avoid that extra clicking?
Given its improtance, shouldn't this wiki be linked around the top of the OpenCare Research page?  ALso, I would put a link to Nadia's recent presentation someplace prominent as well.As Guy said about what reviewers want and don't want, it's also crucial to always remember how fresh eyes will see the site and what actions they are likely to take once they get here.

Thanks @Susa. Between caring and being careless there are many shades I think.. i for example can.t remember when was the last time I asked for  help. Or offered it when someone needed it badly. It.s a function of just what you say: isolation, feeling overwhelmed and especially embarassed. Subjecting oneself to embarrassment is not something today.s societies encourage.
This is informing so many directions in which Edgeryders have been looking and approaches that we've supported over the past years.Paging @Thom Stewart: what I mentioned to you and David Boland the other day about deep thinking behind the idea of moving and working in a secluded place. With your own Pilgrim project in Galway perhaps you will be able to get to a deep narrative that makes it URGENT for it to happen.. because it would solve problems for whole collectivities. 
Thanks for updating the wiki with more relevant info. The dashboard was meant to be a nice page/visualization with all the places people can engage with. At the moment this is probably all the community space - with its different pages. Scraping the formulation from the wiki then. 
I have done a first editing pass. I have some question.The most important: we are now live, but our consent funnel is not ready. ScImpulse has designed it, but not yet deployed. Is this OK? @markomanka, what do you say as the person in charge of ethics?General question: it seems the wiki is written with the OpenCare team in mind, but in the beginning it says The purpose of this document is to help OpenCare project team and members joining edgeryders.eu [...]Less important: what do we mean by ENGAGEMENT TOOLS WE ARE USING - DASHBOARD? There is no dashboard other than this, but that has got nothing to do with social media, meetups etc. I propose to eliminate that. @Noemi I think you are the author....
Ok, settled then:We improve the wiki.We point the Commission to the wikiWe spread its content. We normally spread content in the form of links: in practice, it means that you share (by email, or Twitter, or whatever) a short message that says "We have made XYZ, it's really interesting. Check it out here: [link]." If the [link] points to our own online space, even better: people who are intrigued can very easily find out more, and even start participating.@Noemi and @Nadia; agreed?
Guy, I agree with you, we have to put ourselves in the reviewers' shoes when we have to submit information on the project to the Commission. Alberto, if you wish to use the content of this wiki, this is fine with me, but my point is the following: this mini-presentation  is also a mean now to come clear to the Commission but also to the public about the scientific interest of putting up this platform.When I mean public, I do think of the people already following the project, who may find the wiki just fine, but I also think that each partner could further use this documentation to bring people here together, using our own networks. 
Well, your friend certainly got me wrongfooted. He thinks we should all keep separate to keep cultures pure, yet there he is, a catholic Slav in an Anglo-Celtic protestant country. He does not like the idea of blonde girls sleeping with black guys, but I am sure he, like most men of any shade, enjoys the sight of a pretty black woman. Very hard to argue on these basis. We can only hope that the people bringing back the good stories will be more credible and cooler than those bringing back the bad ones. This way, we can win over more of the new generation – aim at cultural hegemony, in other words. People who believe in cultural purityafter the age of 18? I am afraid they are a lost cause. I do not recommend investing time in trying to change their mind. That's their loss: they are going to miss the music and the food and the laughter and the glorious diversity in Vuka! 
-- we are on the same wavelength (sounds French, "sur la même longueur d'ondes"). I shouldn't be surprised after all :-) A two-pager wiki works fine. @LuceChiodelliUB maybe can build a short printed (pdf) document describing the resources (what's in there, and how/where to find them) to be uploaded through EMDesk.Anyway the point I make remains relevant for all subsequent deliverables. Adopting a reviewer-compatible standpoint makes reviewing material more efficient.
You misunderstand me, Guy. I propose to point [reviewers, the Commission] not to the platform itself, but to this wiki. Which is a 1200 words document that describes the processes – exactly your two pager. But with one advantage: we need it anyway, so it is in our best interest to write it clearly. This gets us rid of the hollow feeling of writing a deliverable that no one cares about, just another box ticked, that I have sometimes felt when doing funded research. Makes sense now?
It gets even worse when I talk to my friends who migrated from Poland and who, living surrounded by people from Arabic countries, India, Pakistan, radicalise even more. One of my friends, after 3 years of living and working in the UK, says that indeed, these people are sometimes good, but the best thing for all of us is to stay away from each other and keep our pure cultures and races. And that it worries him blond girls decide to sleep with black guys. I know I come from an extreme country, where 96% of the people are Poles, and we're all white and catholic - and now imagine even with this huge wave of migration, only some of these people will bring back some good stories of the others. It really makes me wonder that if the stories do not help, if own experiences do not help (wait, I even have a friend living in Brussels who didn't join us on the LOTE evening because it was in Molleenbeck), then how do we make people trust each other and grow a positive, open, supportive, inclusive society? It is also a challenge to create this environment for meetings that would not feel like encountering something exotic and different due to some voyerist instincts - I used to work in italy for an NGO and we organised human libraries there, but even though it is some sort of step for people to have a chat with migrants from Ghana and Bangladesh, to meet transvestites and gay community members, it felt a little bit like a show. These people run into each other on the streets, you see them every day - why so many of us decide not to interact, discover and understand them? It's a puzzle. 
Some case studies showcasing the benefits of shared living.
Here is my view of things, and I am sure this is what Luce has in mind when asking any of us to provide reviewing material. @Alberto @Nadia @LuceChiodelliUBThe idea is to go as smoothly as possible with the reviewing process. The platform and its content -- as suggested by Alberto -- of course tells the story by itself, it's all there ! And it is a living thing, you see the organism in full if you take time to look at it in action.But, but, *reviewers* (and I ask you to believe me, I've played that role quite a few times). You have to put yourself in the skin of a reviewer when deciding what/how/why to deliver. Think of this person, reading about OpenCare a week before the review (sometimes more, but reading ahead of time doesn't mean giving more time reviewing the project). Think of this person who wants to get information in a synthesized way, yet who wants to get a "feeling" about what's going on.So, my take is, it's worth to put up a short, crisp, one or two pager that gives an overview of the deliverable. That tells this person where to go on the portal and what is to find there. You guys are professionnals at communicating ideas with so much enthusiasm. I am sure you all know what I am talking about.I know time flies like an arrow. Reviewers don't like to dig for information, they don't like it when they need to summarize things themselves. Plus, when letting them do the work there is a risk that they don't focus on the right thing -- because yes, they come with their own set of glasses, with their domain of expertise that do not necessarily fit ours a 100% percent ... and well, OpenCare is quite a unique "assemblage" of people, isn't it?
It was great fun. But, hey – we know so many global people now! We can just make more parties like it. In fact, I have half a mind to throwing one in our place this summer... I am sure you can find a DJ in Calais, @Alex_Levene .I also still like the title: Vuka! (apparently it means "arise" in Zulu – or so our South African friend Dan maintained). It's a cool word.
I wish i could have come to that party! It's sounds like so much fun
Great post :-)It seems to me that the experiences you describe are all community-based. It's always people, it's always peer-to-peer. People give each other acceptance, encouragement, sense of direction. This a lot more resilient than being socially validated by how much money you make – if only because the people in these experiences have two ways to get acceptance and validation, one through material achievement and one through the community. So, probably, this is the best path to making all this become "somethings serious": invest on developing as many ways as possible for people to regenerate meaning and validation for each other. 
Direct income support is not part of the package in our group – at least not at this stage. We do help each other financially, but this is mostly a consequence of the economies of scale that exist in family life. The other part is a willingness to cut each other slack; this all started with us accepting to sub-rent to recent migrants, who did not have jobs yet. We trusted them to make it happen, and they did. Later, when we grew from four to six, same thing again: one of the two new people did not have a job, but we took them in all the same. But in the long run, the deal is that you have to pull your weight. Maybe in the future we will have become so attached that we will change the deal. Who knows? Certainly this setup gives us a couple of shots before we have to give up completely. For example, we could sub-rent the extra room, and take the additional income from everyone's rent. Maybe the reduced privacy would be a sacrifice worth making to keep each other close, already now. Depends who you ask, I guess :-) 
This, for me, is a really difficult design challenge.Years ago, I was living in Milan. I got frustrated because, though people from every corner of the world lived in the city side by side with me, almost all of my friends were white Italians like myself. WTF?With a small group of global friends, we responded by throwing a party. The idea was:dance to world music, not just Euro Techno or Detroit House or whatever was in vogue in 2011;stress the "everyone welcome" themethe core group of non-italians, globalised Italians and second-generation Italians would advertise their presence. This was to let people know that (1) no matter where they came from, they would not be the only foreign-looking people in the room, and (2) no, this was not a party of the Eritrean community, or the Peruvian community; it was a party of the Milanese community, just some Milanese happened to be of Eritrean or Peruvian background. I mentioned it in my blog:And so, with a small group of Milanese from all over the world we decided to organize a party to celebrate the diversity of our country and our city. We called it Vuka, which means “Arise!” or “Awaken!” in the Zulu language; and we are going to throw it tomorrow, Tuesday March 22nd at 10 p.m. sharp, at Casa del Pane di Corso di Porta Venezia 63 (map). We designed it as a club night for dancing to the sound of the most cutting-edge clubs of Lagos, Karachi and Barletta [a small town in the south of Italy]; and where the Milanese of any origin are welcome and respected. Join Medhin (Milano–Asmara), Nadia (Stockholm), Dan (Johannesburg), Davide (Verona-Sydney-Osaka) and myself to dance away to the world’s beat in a space where everyone’s welcome, and our many differences of living out Milano power up the party.It worked pretty well! But then, we left the country and could not continue with the experience  :-)
Hello @Mørbeck, good to meet you. I am not sure I understand you completely, but you seem to be saying something like: what you call the natural family is the default locus of care. But some people do not have access to that. They have to make their own, so that they can reproduce that locus.The traditional way to do this was this: you would leave your parents' house, marry, settle down with your spouse and have children. This produced a "one size fits all" world, with most families were very similar to each other in composition. You seem to be saying that now this is untenable, and families should be (and in part are) allowed to be more diverse, like a Lego construction made of different-looking pieces. A DIY sort of family, heavily customized. Is this broadly correct?Because if so, you might be interested in my own quasi-familial thing in Brussels. I love my original family very much, but none of them live in the same country as I do! https://edgeryders.eu/en/living-social-in-brussels-co-living-as-a-lifestyle-for-grown-ups
Nice meeting you "virtually" as well, @Noemi.  See you in the next call :)
:-)@Noemi, @Nadia, should we assign this post to the community space group as well? 
The deliverable is the platform itself, not a report about the platform. Here's a suggestion: this very wiki could serve as the documentation to that deliverable. We clearly need it, so time spent on it is not wasted; and it tells users and the team how to navigate the OC community space. So maybe stick a Horizon 2020 logo into it; add a couple of screenshots (Nadia's slides, I guess), and send the EC, I don't know, a good-looking PDF file containing the link to the wiki? @LuceChiodelliUB, does this work?
Hi @Moushira, lovely to meet you virtually. I'm noemi, doing part of the community mmanagement online in open care. I'm saying part because I see you are also attached to somehow being close to our growing community, like many of us involved. Hope to see you on Monday at our regular online hangouts 16:30 cet? https://edgeryders.eu/en/op3ncare/op3n-meetups
Thanks for introducing yourself. I look forward to hearing more about your project and seeing what WeMake!Alex
Lets see how we can grow a happy OpenCare community :)
Hi Moushira, Welcome to the team ! Hope we'll get to know you soon :)Luce
Thanks for your thoughts @Tomma and for keeping the rest of us not in Berlin up to date.My name is Noemi, and myself learning to live daily with a smiling face. Not very easy, but I enjoy being in my home environment - and the feeling of safety which it gives. Here is my story, looking forward to read you. By the way you can Edit your post anytime should you want to add more info about yourself. Cheers!
Hi @Cindy, how is Berlin treating you, did you find inspiration in ways in which the community welcomed you? Back in the days Berlin used to be one of the most interesting, rich-in-diversity spaces to be in. Actually even now Edgeryders has a strong community base there, if you're interested to meet up let me know. I bet you met Susa and Nadia already, so that should give you a hint.I look forward to visiting again, art festivals there are a favourite of mine.
@Alberto is this really necessary?
sorry. Back at end of week.
Hi Nadia, Any news concerning the platform presentation ?I know you've been busy those days - if you need more time, just let me know :)
In Azerbaijan and Armenia
Thank you @Alex Levene! Though it's temporary ceasefire, Azeris still shoot but not as much as before, now we need to wait and see...apparently there are 2 solutions out of this: full blown war or back to frozen conflict. The thing is Armenians are united against a common enemy and ready to protect their land while for Azeris this is a matter of principle - after all NKR has been a part of Azerbaijan during USSR, so they can't accept to lose it. Apparently no way to solve this conflict in a diplomatic way...maybe in a 100 years, when the rulers change and the new open-minded generation comes to power.
Hi @Cristina Martellosio, looking at the Challenges active now in Open Care to discover inspiring stories I wonder if there are people/ cases that you learned about during the Milan events (this one and others)? Maybe someone who was especially interested in joining Open Care could be invited here or interviewed? If it's in Italian rather than English, it's also fine.I'm thinking it would be helpful to get a sense of how people you engage are responding and what we can offer as a community.
This is awful news given all the psoitive information you were sharing with us at LOTE5. I'm upset (but not surprised) that this issue is receiving absolutely no attention in UK.I will do what i can to share storiesAlex
Nice to meet you @JanStassen!I don't speak German so I used google translate to understand your post (English translation here). If I got it well, you have said wise words: we don't need to reach the care utopia with normalized approaches, but with trial and error. Are simulator workshops something to look into with more detail then? Any other tells or resources you know, do tell. that would be useful to OpenCare where we are supposed to look into promising ideas and prototype them - but prototyping in the "lab" so to speak could mean a due dilligence fail test (?) hm. 
Hi @Luisa, nice to meet you and welcome on board of Edgeryders. I'm Noemi, and like you I was disappointed at the lack of empathy people around manifest when it comes to displaced populations.End of February in Brussels many of us edgeryders had a community event to look at what is out there and how people like us can be part of a constructive mobilization. We had a powerful case study from Armenia where @Iriedawta shared mind bogging numbers and wasteful efforts in her country to deal with this, but we also met people like the group at Dine With Us in Brussels who are one step ahead of the game. That, for me, is an illustrative answer to your question "can we trigger it at home?"For me, the test is winning arguments with family and close friends whose opinions are a little far off from mine. What is your practical experience? 
Interessante Dialoge zwischen Produktdesign- und GWK-Studenten ausgehend von den Themen "People in Move" und "Peer to Peer":Jan, Marie:J: Ist das immernoch Design, so ein Community-Projekt zu gestalten?M: Ich finde es sehr schwer, Design zu definieren und mittlerweile umfaßt der Designbegriff mehr als nur Produkte, sondern vor allem auch Prozesse.J: Was ist dann der große Unterschied zwischen einem Designer und einem Manager, wenn es um Prozesse geht?M: Das klingt jetzt eher klischeehaft, aber es heißt, der Manager sieht alles eher auf sich bezogen, auf Profit. Als Designer ist man vielleicht eher ergebnisorientiert.              J: Hast du schon eine Idee von etwas, was man im Sinne von OpenCare gestalten könnte?M: Ehrlich gesagt, nein.J: Man könnte erst einmal von Bedürfnissen ausgehen, z.B. eine App, die deine Bedürfnisse aufzeichnet und ein Profil erstellt.M: Ich bin skeptisch gegenüber Apps. Es sollte andere Möglichkeiten geben. Ich persönlich benutze nicht so oft Apps, weil ich nicht gerne von meinem Handy abhängig sein möchte, und es andere Möglichkeiten der Kommunikation geben sollte.J: Aber hast du ein Beispiel von sehr guten Design, was dich dazu inspiriert hat, Design zu studieren?M: Ich bin eher zufällig darauf gestoßen. Ursprünglich kam ich auf die Kunst, aber das Design gibt dir die Möglichkeit mehr als nur auszudrücken, sondern auch einen Nutzen zu kreieren. Kunst ist zwar Kommunikation, aber nicht in dem Ausmaße des Designs.J: Was denkst du, sind die Stärken des Designers im Gegenzug zum Künstler?M: Der Künstler wirft Fragen auf, ohne jedoch eine Antwort zu geben, er macht nur bewußt. Der Designer hingegen löst die Probleme, die er findet.J: Sehr schöne Metapher. Kannst du mir ein Beispiel von flüssigem Design nennen? Also etwas was nicht solide im Raum steht? Oder habt ihr so etwas schon im Studium gehabt?M: Wir hatten im letzten Semester Critical Design zum Thema. Das war eher prozessorien orientiert, würde ich sagen, da es Awareness kreiert, ohne ein solides Produkt.Ich hatte dazu ein Spiel gestaltet, das Leuten wieder zu einer analogen Kontaktart verhelfen sollte, und gleichzeitig zum Nachdenken anregen soll, was Menschen im Internet von sich preisgeben.J: Jetzt zu OpenCare. Sagen wir, viele Menschen bewegen sich, und nehmen im mer wieder andere Systeme in Anspruch.M: Eine Möglichkeit wäre zB ein nationenübergreifendes System, daß jeder, egal wo er sich gerade befindet, auf sein CareSystem zugreifen kann.

Hi @Alberto, nice to read you again on this topic.So: together when you want to be, but apart when you want to be apart.It seems like your group has found just the right balance between couple intimacy and social sharing of the space, which is something that would scare many of us grownups. There is something about growing mature that makes one more and more into their own ways, and less willing to take on 'adventurous' lifestyles. Maybe it's not obvious now how that pays off tenfold in the long term (i.e. family surrogates). Do you think this setup can work if not all of you were middle class (as precarious or as unstable as middle class can be)? If someone joins but they soon fall off because of too low earnings, will the rest be able to catch them?
Great, thanks !Just let me know when you are ready. :) 
and we can put in the stuff we need there. Will try to get done by monday.
We are late according to the EC, since the platform was planned in the Annex 1 of the GA to be fully operational by the end of February and we should have submitted information by that time.I think the delay may be acceptable by the EC, since we can explain in our reports that the platform was mainly ready in due time, that edgeryders introduced it during the kick-off, with extra adjustments related to users' comments/experiences being carried out in March.Unfortunately, I don't have any specific template nor guidelines about the way we should present the plateform, the content is free.We could prepare some short presentation (1 to 2 pages) using these themes: structure, motives, scientfic outcomes.It could then relate to the Description of Action and could be used again for public dissemination (maybe?). 
The online space is live: http://opencare.cc what other work you are seeing being done is tweaks. Unless I am completely missing something?Presentation of the platform: Do you have a template or questions we need to answer more specifically? It will not take long to do this and certainly before April 15 should not be a problem.
Hi everyone, We have another deadline (upcoming deliverable) :WP2, Deliverable 2.1: Deployed, tested OpenCare online space on the production server What we need to submit : presentation of the platform (structure, motives, scientfic outcomes) + links to the Op3nCare workspacesWhen: by April 15th (if possible). We are already late - just let me know if this date sounds realistic or not.  
In order for briefs to be efficient in terms of engaging people to relate deeply and submit stories, they need to be rock solid in providing background information about the topic - short and well packaged, but to the point and credible. It is that background info that helps us contextualize issues and ask very good questions. It seems that especially for dementia and suicide, it would be great to have people with medical training sharing information or pointing us to useful resources.Any way you guys can share the drafts linked above with your networks asking people what is it that they find most important to ask when it comes to coming up with effective, community solutions?Also, let me know if you know professionals that are also good writers whom we can approach for writing stories in response to the themes - personal experiences and takes on the issue (example of a contribution) 
I'll be going to EMF.Booked my tickets a few weeks back.They're still got workshop spaces open.You should definitely bring your biochar rocket-stove. Ian, the blacksmith who's running the open forge sessions, would be interested, as well as a few others i know.Also have a look at Wevolver.com. They're tring to be a Github for Open Source HardWare. I'm hosting one of my projects there, https://www.wevolver.com/billy.smith/reservoir-planters/main/description/Another project that i've been helping out with can be found here, http://r-urban-wick.net/events/learn-to-build-an-anaerobic-digester
Just caught this @phm - don't know if @ pinging was working correctly when you posted?I've been considering emfcamp.  I'm part of a mobile hackspace/workshop project and back in January made the proposal to do something with our workshop at EMF, but nobody else appeared interested. I've been thinking about doing some kind of fantastical area at an event for a while, something inspired by madmax, solarpunk and https://archive.org/details/NomadicEcoVillages - not quite sure how/if that would fit in with OpenCare, although I guess it could? pinging @Billy Smith in the hope that the pings are working again :) 
The event seems professional and that fact that it's well thought of in advance probably means it's good outreach if we participate. So already Edgeryders is in, whether it's us personally attending or OpenCare Fellows, that is something we can discuss. I would see projects we find in the community attend the hackathon as a project development perk, only those we'll know in some weeks from now. 
thanks!

Says "denied" when I try to go there.  The TED links work ok.
I'm game. We could organise an Op3n Hangout call dedicated to this rel. soon. It clicks with some things I am exploring including a pitch to Fedasil (Belgian Federal agency that manages all the refugee reception centres in the country).
an excellent opportunity.
EdgeRyders: @Alberto @Nadia @Noemi SCImpulse: @Massimo @markomanka EHFF: @Lakomaa WeMake: @Costantino @zoescope Milano: @Rossana Torriand I am sure I miss some people -- please let them know (the mention thing is not fu...nctioning, not totally).---I just met with the local organizers of the Bordeaux Health Hacking event to take place next Fall in Bordeaux. This post awaits a clear answer from everyone in our consortium. I need to get back at the organizers with a set of proposals in the coming month.---We are com-ple-te-ly in line with their view on Social Care and how Health Hacking can change the game. The Health Hacking event is actually a trademarked event that originated in Canada (I might meet with co-founder  Luc Sirois on the occasion of a travel in Quebec in April). They have a Europe wide yearly edition that usually takes place in Strasbourg.I believe we have advantage of being part of this event in Bordeaux. I would encourage as many of you as possible to join. Here are a list of things we could do:The event starts with a one-day of talks. We can ask to have a 1/2 hour slot to talk about what/how/why we are doing. I am sure a combination of visions emerging from EdgeRyders/ScImpulse/WeMake/(Milano?) will be of interest to a majority of people attending the conference. (Did you know 50% of gross salles -- chiffre d'affaires in French -- in technology related health business is made in Aquitaine?).The event then welcomes a hackaton where teams work on project that are pitched in by sponsors (companies, organizations, name it). Each project is pitched in on Friday evening; teams form around projects and useful competencies; other people are there to coach teams on tech, legal, medical or any other aspects during the whole duration of the hackaton.Project output are graded and prizes are offered to teams -- no money, but rather accompanying measures to help teams go forward with their ideas and prototypes. OpenCare could well pitch in a project on which team(s) would work. This could be an opportunity to recruit competencies we find necessary for a prototype we have in view.I feel this is a not-to-miss opportunity. I know the EC funded OpenCare has a short, two years life to live, but OpenCare should make it so to last much longer. By discussing with the local organizers -- they happen to both be medical practitioners and tech passionates, I could foresee potential future projects on a vast panel of topics. 
I'm glad to share with you this two short videos that, in my view, express the essence of Open Care. Innovation for everybody.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5EClZGelAvnejdjT0RPa2RuRXc/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5EClZGelAvncDdydTRxRmdLRzA/view?usp=sharingSome nice stuff to share with you soon! 
This is very cool, we should bring Nagler into the conversation! @Noemi
Ok,People on the move makes a lot of sense. It includes people who move for any number of reasons. But we then need to give people some examples of what might fall under that, e.g. People fleeing war, People moving abroad to study, working mostly online and living in different parts of the world etc.I'll prepare the  docs for the other two, for now, have a look and contribute to shaping the brief to would be participants for the dementia related initiatives in this shared document?Another  helpful contribution would be to share your own reflections on this after the workshop we both participated in during lote5. I'm doing the same further below in the same document 
Opening domains allows us to capture potentially more great examples. For example, there is probably nothing to be gained by restricting to hackers the suicide prevention story (we are looking into it as part of a different piece of work we are doing in Galway: apparently, suicide is endemic in the West of Ireland). If we just look into suicide prevention, we can still fetch all of the stories coming from the hacker community. On the other hand, suicide prevention is more suited to community-driven solution than treating mental distress. Why? Because it's about someone being there at the right time, pulling the suicidal person away from the brink. This presents interestingly specific challenges. In this case we might lose some focus if we move over to "mental distress". 
hi Alberto, we agree on you summary,we feedbacked Nadia on the other thread regarding the domains of actionhttps://edgeryders.eu/en/comment/22032#comment-22032bestZoe
Hi Nadia,We agree with what you propose, we have a couple of comments regarding two of the domains:social/health care to refugees Why focus only on refugees and not on migrants in general? Or if we don’t want to call them migrants and refugees, let’s call them something like people in movement without papers: Sans-PapierPrevention of Suicide in the hacker community This target is a bit too tight on hackers and becomes then necessary define what is a hacker and we think we could get stuck in this conversation (ie. why only hackers and  not makers? what are really hackers?) .Why don’t we focus on the domain of mental distress (or psychological distress) in high-tech service sector?bestZoe
Ok guys, here's what I understood:OpenCare studies community-driven care services. This means "activities of giving care to people that need it, and that are open to anyone's participation" (Ezio's A1). For example: the Helliniko Community Clinic.Our attention is on how these things come into being. This means we are focusing on the design choices of their protagonists and to the emergent social dynamics driving them (Ezio's B2). For example, we consider how the design move of not incorporating enabled the Helliniko Community Clinic to work like it does. This is all set against an institutional backdrop. Example: liability for doctors in Greece is attached to the doctors themselves, whereas in Sweden it is attached to the hospitals.This is all a bit too abstract to prompt an online conversation, so we start by looking at community driven care activities in three domains: social/health care to refugees; suicide prevention; and treatment of dementia (more). Is that clearer now? Do you all agree? @Ezio Manzini, I am particularly interested in your say. Here's why: at this point of my thinking, I am seeing design as the main discipline from which to cast our aspirational high-impact publication. I do not think anymore we (i.e. "society") can "solve" the crisis in health and social care, like a mathematician would be tempted to do. Nor do I think we can "optmise" for it – this is how an economist would go about it. But I do think we can make a move towards higher grounds in the fitness landscape; and moves is what designers do. But, if you (or the others) are not convinced, then it's back to the drawing board. I agree with you that we need to be on the same page here. 
I strongly agree with @Alberto The meaning of my statement above are: people are already implementing A1 systems (they deliver care and they are open) by making A2 stuff (inventing and producing services etc.). We conjecture that openness in the process (2) is an enabler of A1. More precisely, we conjecture that without open processes (B2) there can be no open care (A1), but the reverse is not true. You can use open, participatory processes to design closed systems and artifacts. I guess the implication is to study closely the B2 side of things, and how openness in the process results (or not) in A1-type open care.  -

Hi everyone, I have been thinking and trying to make sense of @Ezio, @LuceChiodelliUB , @Costantino and @Alberto 's points above. Firstly I think it is a phase in which we do need to have a few more calls to find a common direcition and this early phase in the project. At th consortium meeting we did the first part of setting the foundations, but that is only the first step. We now need to tackle the actual content of the research, how we will weave this all in together...and think together really :) Last week we did have the first of the open calls and it was very helpful. We tested a software that was not really up to the job, se we will stick to google hangout from now on. Now for the "meat" in the comment: Yesterday Ezio and I met in London to think together around how to proceed with our part of the research. I had been struggling to understand the distinction Ezio was making the sense in which we are exploring "Openness" in the context of care. I  think I understand better now, and think I am algined with Ezio, and away from Alberto, that it is the first which is more fruitful/interesting. For me the openness has to do with more porous interface between what is inside a cateogry or institution or practice, a place..etc and what is outside. And what happens in those situations where there is a fuzzy, or een decomposing boundary between them. Professional caregivers, vs others. Between insiders and outsiders of a community. Between users and builders of technologies. Less so the collaborative, participatory nature of our research project. Which for me is given. The very fact that we are having this conversation like this, in the open, with all the difficulties of comprehension that it involves mean that we are already doing this. Seen from here, the conversation we are really trying to have is one of research curation, where to direct our gaze and why. As well as the filter through which we look at it. During yesterday's conversation Ezio and I reflected on how Europe had reacted to the Paris attacks. How a small number of individuals could shut down two countries for a two days. Similarly it is remarkable that in the world's wealthiest continent, a relatively small number of refugees can destabilise the entire system. Can this  be tied to people's sense of being vulnerable, even with nice jobs etc? Can it be there is a sense of lack of social protection because of not being firmly anchored in caring communities?  But what does this term community actually mean in a contemporary, urban situation? Ezio's work at Central Saint Martins has been exploring this. His students have been looking at weaving together people and places in situations where connections are fleeting and ephemeral (not like in villages where you are stuck with one another in the same place for better or worse). Noemi, Alberto and myself have been working with related things with Edgeryders, creating a sense of place and community that remains even though the relationships which make it (who is there, who interacts with whom, what people connect over etc) are constantly changing. John, before us with other settings and constellations of people. It seems Ezio and I have arrived at the same intuition and this is where his interest in Opencare lies:   How can we use design to reconcile this need for the individual to be free to choose their level of engagement in care, with the need for the care recipient to feel continuity, local anchoring and coherence design these factors into existing or new initiatives?Can having an option to spread the care over more people nudge more people to engage in caring activities? And if so, under which conditions  does this happen or not (which are the critical factors)? There are three situations within which it may be especially generative to focus our research attention:Social and or health care of refugees in Germany/EuropePrevention of Suicide in the hacker communityHelping both caregivers and care receivers in dealing with dementia in urban environmentsThese three areas we choose because they are situations in which the crisis of care in modernity is very  visible. I think (please forgive my fumbling approach to articulate intuition into words with my limited understanding of your areas of expertise and interest): All three involve people in vulnerable situations where dynamics in community connections, or lack of, play a significant role. Can Guy/Alberto's network science perspective help us to make visible and understand these social flows?All three also involve some interaction with the formal health and social care system, conditions as well as norms/behaviors in society at large. Can Erik and Tino's approach help us make sense of this and translating it into institutionally comprehensible language?All three also involve and require a deep understanding of healing and medical practice, especially the ethical considerations for both caregivers and care recipients. Can Marco, Massimo's and other's work in the field and in the lab help us to identify and understand how to deal with these issues? In the research as well as in the intiatives themselves?The city as a place and institutions is where all of these interactions and relationships live (or do not). Can Lucia and Rossana and others in the city of Milano help us understand how a city can make visible and enable promising approaches and nurturing the people who drive them?Can we design interventions offer workarounds to the obstacles these intiatives, and the indivuals they attempt to support (caregivers and care recipients)? What forms could these interventions take in order to unlock more care in the different situations (artefacts, communication, services, processes, upskilling, administrative and legal hacks, policy changes and or something else? Here I think the ingenuity and very particular skillset of Costantino, Zoe and others in the weMake constellation could make a very important contribution.Thoughts?

Thanks @Ezio_Manzini. I did look up the Canadian case (Tyze). From what I see, it's aimed at professional home care providers (hospitals etc.). In practice, if you are a company or public hospital providing home care to someone, you are only a part of the patient's network of support. Other parts include family and possibly friends. There seems to be the idea that many decisions about treatments etc will not be made by the person in need of care ("client" in the company website's language), but by others. Perhaps the "client" is very old and doctors and professional caregivers relate to her children. So, make a social network centered on the "client" and bring down the coordination costs of care. Their USP is here:HOW TYZE CAN HELP YOUR BUSINESSPushing schedules and daily care documentation into clients’ Tyze networks = Reduced inbound support costs Ability to extend brand to those who share in the care journey of your client = Increased brand awareness Digital delivery of informational and support materials = Reduced printing costs Enhanced communication and care coordination via a Tyze network = Increased customer satisfaction and retention Tyze per se is low value added technology. Youy could do the same thing with wikis, Trello, Google Apps and whatever. They have a solid intuition behind it, though, and the people using Tyze, and how they coordinate, and who they are etc. could tell many interesting stories to OpenCare. The meaning of my statement above are: people are already implementing A1 systems (they deliver care and they are open) by making A2 stuff (inventing and producing services etc.). We conjecture that openness in the process (2) is an enabler of A1. More precisely, we conjecture that without open processes (B2) there can be no open care (A1), but the reverse is not true. You can use open, participatory processes to design closed systems and artifacts. I guess the implication is to study closely the B2 side of things, and how openness in the process results (or not) in A1-type open care. 
This is a feedback to @Alberto, @Costantino  and @Nadia.  The premise is that for what regards the the structure to be given to the OpenCare (the project). I will accept and respect what Alberto, and if I have well understood Costantino too, propose. That is, in Alberto’s words: “We study people who do A1. They will be the backbone of the OpenCare (the project) community. We (the research team) ourselves focus on B2, and hope to learn ways that we can get more A1 stuff out there by showing people how to set their process right. This is why, though A1 is the object of our study, in practice we spend much of our time on B2.” I cannot say that the meaning and the practical implications of this statement are crystal clear for me. But in a research it has to be like that. And I am curious.Regarding Nadia’s first post, I agree with her when she proposes to : “Having this option of spreading the burden of care over more people might be one way to nudge more people to engage in caring activities” this is only the strategy I proposed in my post. Maybe there are other strategies, but this one appers to me particularly interesting and potentially generative.Given that, how to go on?On my side, I can make some steps in the direction I know better, i.e. A1, leaving others to help me to find bridges with B1.  If this makes sense, the first step is to ask you, to give me some feedbacks on the other parts of my post above (they went  the A1 vs B2 options!).  I would like to have, if possible, some feedbacks on them too.Here I will highlight some one first, and in my view crucial, point. In my original note I wrote:“The practical/organizational side of care is particularly important because care is not only exchanging information and knowledge. Care asks also for proximity and action: doing something for each other, taking time and being committed.”Writing that I want to underline, is that care (by the points of view of who, in a given moment, need care), requires proximity and continuity. These proximity and continuity is, in a my opinion, a major difference with other, mainly information-based activities (that often can work also without them).Therefore, if as Nadia also says, a care strategy could be the one of “spreading the burden of care over more people”, the first problem that appears is that their different bits of care activity have to be perceived, and by all means, be, from the point of view of who in that moment is the care receiver, as deliveres with continuity: the different care giver must appear as one continuous entity operating in proximity.In my notes I indicated one case that I think could be interesting by this point of view and that I invite you to invite you see: the case of Tyze, in Canada.In my view this case is very interesting but … it is presented as a private, and therefore, closed, network of care! What do you think?
I'm more worried about people hacking into my computer. My computer is part of me / my brain. OSs have always been exploitable. The fact that everything is connected to internet all the time makes the problem worse, but not a new thing.I don't care so much if they hack my car. What are they gonna do? Make it drive off a cliff? Unlikely. Yeah, sure, it's a bit scary if someone can hack into your pacemaker and switch it off remotely, but how many people are this evil? Not so many. If you wanna be evil and kill people, it's not difficult to get a gun. That's just a fact of life, humans are weak and vulnerable.So my point is: This IoT security panic is being blown out of proportion. It's nothing new.Sure we will fix it, but it's probably going to take A.I. There is no easy solution. Telling everyone to stop using Microsoft would be a good start, if you care about security.
Peter thanks for taking the time to post your nots above. Would like to really read and reply to your questions, share reflections etc but am on the road till Sunday. Will post in soon

EMF is August 5th - 7th 2016, Guildford. https://www.emfcamp.org/We could do something there. @billy-smith @darren
Hi Nadia,That would be amazing, but i think i have to work tonight and tomorrow daytime which means i can't do anything. I'm waiting to hear back, in which case i might be able to come down tonight, but it's 50/50 at the moment.I'm busy from early friday morning as i'm going to the wilds of Scotland for a week to write poetry and read EU cultural documents!Alex
Hangout was good. Started in 'appear.in' but it was really laggy so we moved to Google hangouts.My feeling was that I'd be more likely to put effort into the open care thing if I believed it would come up with concrete results (e.g. helping people / reducing suffering) , if it was just making a big document that got read and largely ignored, I'd feel it was a waste of time, and I think everyone will share this feeling.I think Nadia agreed, and said that we could/should try to get some concrete change from this project (as well as fulfilling the minimum requirements of providing the research / ideas / documentation.)For the research part, I thought the only way to actually know what is going on would be to go to places where health care is needed, and talk to people first hand. Get a feel for their situation. (Rather that trusting info sources from others). So I think we could get people to visit anywhere that seems like it might lack good health care and talk to people in need, and the people giving the care. e.g. Refugee camps, impoverished inner city areas where there are too many people and not enough doctors / hospitals. Rural areas where it's hard for people to get health care. Go to places, talk to people get first hand accounts, do surveys and get numbers.For stats / raw data , I'd want to know:* How many doctors/clinics/hospitals there are in the area.* How the health care is funded: (is it governments paying with taxes? Charities? The communities themselves dealing with the problems, without outside help?)* How do people get to the health care when they need it? distance? cost?* How long do they have to wait? satisfaction with the care they receive?* How many people need care and are not getting it?etc.Someone (forgot name) asked an important question: Does our client (client?) care about the situation in America, or because it's EU money do they not care about far away places, with maybe completely different situations / cultures?For the UK, an important question i would like answered is: 'how good is the NHS?' Are they doing the right thing, and only limited by lack of money, Or could their methods / efficiency be improved? If so, how? How could they improve? Better software / organisation? a change in culture?(I know they wasted a ton of money on software, cos they gave money to some lame suit and tie company instead of getting real hackers that smoke weed. But I guess that's really a separate issue.)To me, the most exciting idea would be to get hackers involved in health care. Healing people is (often / can be) easy when you apply creativity and radical tech and hacker problem solving mentality.I think an important question raised was 'is the legal side preventing this from happening more? Or will it get in our way?'Maybe hackers are put off operating on people cos they might get sued if it goes wrong? Or 'pretending' to be a dentist is illegal and only people with official training should be allowed to mess with teeth?(Issues with stuff like law getting in the way of common sense hacking with pacemakers cos of stupid patent laws / lack of open software ?)Nadia said we can find people with expert legal knowledge, and see what the situation is.(Common wisdom is that dentistry is very difficult and takes 7 years training, or whatever. I can see why this makes sense. It *is* very difficult and can get very bad results if it goes wrong, so obviously 'amateurs' should not hack teeth.However, I actually think this is not as obvious as some may think. When talking about starting a radical hacker community on an island, one of the points that came up, is can we really mange without any outside help? What if someone has tooth problems, should we consider this when deciding on location? I said 'we can't do dentistry, it's too hard' but some in our crew actually thought it was not beyond the realms of possibility. He would have to spend a few hours reading, and time making specialised equipment (drills, maybe X-ray machine, etc) and make our own morphine (actually that's the easy bit, but general anaesthetic can be tricky/dangerous). So anyway, I'm not suggesting it will be common place in the near future for people to get their teeth fixed at hackerspaces. Just wanted to point our that genius hackers can do amazing / crazy high tech things if they have the time. Nothing is beyond us. So I imagine it could be very feasible for hackers to help with more simple aspects of health care, and there is no reason that they should not be allowed to do so. )Also mentioned: hackers making rucksacks for refugees.What about shelters for homeless? I've always been keen on squatting, using tech knowhow to get abandoned buildings into liveable states.This is not directly health care, but you can argue prevention is better than needing to cure. E.g. if people are living on the streets or extreme poverty where they can't keep warm and dry, and wash, of course they are more like to get sick and have many health problems.So the thing that excites me the most is getting hackers involved in radical change like this.Nadia said that actually getting positive change was something we could and should be doing (even though technically we don't have to DO anything, just provide research / ideas).So she suggested that I could help organise an event in London, where we get hackers together, and see what we can do.So I think a big event with lots of hackers would be good.Nadia mentioned planing to do something in London, and in June. Not sure why London (just cos I was keen to help, and i know London?) or were you thinking of doing something in London anyway? and why June? dunno. but anyway, that seems feasible.The minimum i would expect from this, is just lots of brainstorming / ideas by smart hackers that we can document and add to the report.The best case, would be if something more long term came out of it, and they ended up improving health care in London.London hackspace would be the logical place to host it (and I know the members and trustees very well).So if you guys think that sounds like it's worth doing, I will contact them and see what they feel and if there is any support / excitement about the idea. They would probably allow the space to be used for free, but if we wanted a lot of people and for more than one day, it could be a nice gesture to offer to donate some money from the grant for use of the space. (it's entirely non-profit and run by members) (they did look into charity status, but decided against it)Normally it's members only, but they will make exceptions for special events (and a lot of the people interested would be members anyway).I know one or two members that are involved in edgeryders, so I would also contact them.What do you think?
Hiyah Alex,was just writing up my notes from the call and saw this. I'm going to be in London from tomorrow through to Sunday.1) there's a dinner Im hosting (Ezio will be there as well) if you you'd like to join us. I've rented an airbnb so if you need a place to crash you're welcome to stay there too2) I'd love to meet them, with you also if you have time? I've no problem getting to where they are and if you'd like to join me that would be even better :)Let me know?
Hi John,I watched it when it was on TV in the UK. It was very powerful and interesting, certainly worth following up with them.The link to watch it through the UK BBC iPlayer service is here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b073jh6b I think it's only available to UK IP addresses, but i'm sure that won't hold you back, a simple VPN will get past that.You can also follow the link and buy it as a video download for about $2/2Euro if you're feeling generous.It s a couple of months old (they did their journey at the beginning of the year) so they visited the Calais camp which is now very different and in the process of being forcibly cleared by French Police and government officials. Sadly this will just mean that it's even more difficult to treat and assess the conditions of the refugees as they are most dispersed around the area and the clinic and social services that had been set up by volunteers and 3rd Sector orgs have been dismantled and closed.If you wanted to organise a meeting or discussion with them i'd be happy to act as an intermediary, or scribe so we could share with the rest of the community.Alex
I would potentially find it useful only if it can complement the semantic analysis - so on top of us finding what concepts are related and talked about most, we also have a map of feelings around those concepts that puts care priorities in a whole different light. Or the layers you mention ("opinion" "contradict" etc). But if you have an ethnographer analysing the more in-depth conversation, isn't that covered? @jimmytidey is involved in mapping tweets in online consultation processes, maybe he has some insights for how insightful twitter conversations can be for research purposes? http://localnets.org/
Hi Nadia,we will update you after the event! We have sent the promotional flyer (the one at the beginning of the post) to all the places heavily visited by elderly people.For next events, we will use the same strategy with the other social groups: families, immigrants etc.
@Alberto @MassimoMercuri [Je n'ai pas résisté à faire ce mauvais jeu de mots ...]My guess is you don't see value in sentiment analysis because up to now you have been able to track almots every and each of the users, and probably every and each post/comment on edgeryders.eu -- this is no surpirse, it's your job as a community manager!What if the community grows, what if the volume of excange makes it so that you cannot afford to track each individual or post?Maybe "sentiment" is not the good way of thinking about how to use this technology. And maybe, it's true, sentiment coloring is not that useful.Let's give it a second chance.- What if, on top of the topics that people discuss, I can tag some posts/comments as being "opinions", "knowledge sharing", "second", "contradict", etc.? 
I am no fan of sentiment analysis. I tried with several words ("edgeryders", "edgeryders OR opencare", "stewardship", but I can't seem to learn anything of substance. Hope that was not too disappointing, @melancon...
See discussion here? https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare/fellowship-program-timeline-and-rewards-each-partner-can
Open your heart.Imagine you read posts, you are trying to understand what is going on in the Op3nCare crowd, maybe looking how newcomers are doing, maybe looking for places where lively debates take (took) place.How does the sentiment scale used in the demo serves your search? How would you go from the sentiment map to the data you are looking for?Come on guys, be generous, tell me all -- I need it to fuel WP5. Thanks! 
Claudio will be our rockstar!!
You guys in Milano rock. Well done!  
Opencare press conference - Comune di Milano & WeMake   from WeMake | fablab makerspace
Hi! A couple of pics from today's press conference!https://www.flickr.com/photos/wemake_cc/albums/72157665517816471Betty
Hi @Betty Gorf !Sorry for the bad link - You can get the whole EC package of logos in JPEG format from here: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/communication/services/visual_identity/img/standard/standard-pos-jpg-high-all.zipSource: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/communication/services/visual_identity/index_en.htm
Hi @LuceChiodelliUB!Can you check the link to the logo? It's not working :-(Thank you! 
Loved it and added it to our visual repository in the google drive.  
Great idea, thanks !I could also lend you a hand with this - just let me know :) 
I'm preparing some template slides with standardised information about the project where people can then add their own content for their public presentations. So we all know we're "safe" in terms of fullfilling grant agreement requirement for comms while still enabling decentralised workflow :))
Hi Alberto, Great presentation !I would like to point at just one tiny detail - Could you please add in your presentation (maybe at the end?) the following information?- European Commission logo (available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxnwAmGNB9t9N2x0UE9ZeUx5eVE) - The project credits : "This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 688670."All partners within the project are compelled by the European Commission to display them on every communication related to the project.Thank you !Luce
Kidding aside. Very curious how you are structuring this event, what communication materials you have sent to whom and then what people actually say/do during the event.The reason being that if we can learn from one another, then we can help others maybe do the same workshops/event where they are based....
Ciao Alberto,thanks for sharing the slides. Due cose. Edgryders ha piu di 3000 members. E poi e intergenerazionale, non solo giovane :)
Looking forward to hearing what happened, especially how you guys introduced the project (got slides or presentation notes?) and which questions people asked!
Goodmorning everybody,as introduced by @zoescope , today we will present the project at Palazzo Marino. Here the link to our short slide presentation:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lrq3bHZR2WKeZ1vAYl7iCKWnr_P9650xr35EFLbUXvg/edit?usp=sharingmore updates soon!Alberto
Hi :)During the  Op3nCare community call today (tuesdays at 16.30 CET), we discussed how to structure the Op3nCare outreach so as to create the conditions for mutual learning and shared insights relevant to everyone involved.It could be that they are currently in a care-related situation themselves (as caregiver/reciever)......or someone who is not directly affected but cares, and wants to support their efforts in navigating the situation.It could also just be someone who is professionally engaged and wants to know how they can make a meaningful contribution.I wrote the comment above more as a mental note to not forget something ephemeral, a beginning of a thought really. A bit later I wrote a more reflective post where I try to start digging into it.. https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5-doc/after-lote5-where-do-we-even-begin-to-talk-about-failures-in 
Hello Nadia,thank you for your contribution.  Any clear idea of what is intended with the case-studies?  What would you like to do around these three examples?They appear to be interesting but I feel the urge of going deeper with them.  looking forward to the way ahead... 
@guy instead of giving here an impromptu example we're approaching these in a little more structured way. Just wait a little bit!  ;)   
!!
Either Lorenzo has a very clutter-free brain or you took great notes. Or both. Either way, this is really insightful. 
I had used the 3-person 'storytelling' approach before (possibly at another LOTE?) but I really found it effective here. Maybe because our current societal view of care can at times be very practical and mechanical: you take a symptom to a professional, and procedure or medication is applied... There's not often much chance for deep reflection. So this was a nice chance to gradually eke out insights from our collective experience, we started on a relatively basic level and then by the end we had covered a lot of ground, a sense of trust and intimacy was developed we got into some very interesting questions (and answers!)Here are my notes from the first interview, with Constantino asking Lorenzo about his experiences with care. 
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I'm the dummy guy in the gang. I need @Costantino to provide examples of what you put behind these classes: material / immaterial; simple / complex, low impact / high impact; low growth rate / high growth rate. Or is it the classification itself you wish to discuss? 
During LOTE5 some of us had a parallel discussion around narratives of care. We started with small listening triads where participants shared personal experiences around care. Then we had a larger free-wheeling conversation where more people got involved, including Erik.Some observationsOne conclusion (as I understand it) is that there are a lot of difficulties involved in setting the context for care. How to communicate and negotiate around the different needs, capacities, permission/willingness to get involved and constraints of both caregivers and care recipients. In part because the boundaries between the roles are fluid, especially in trying to deal with psycho-social distress involved. From a conversation that took place after LOTE5 someone mentioned "learned helplessness" and how to cope with this as a caregiver.Coping mechanisms: Networked careSomeone mentioned one coping mechanism being to require the person asking for help to spread the burden by reaching out to more people in their caring network. I mention it because I think this is something we could look into: how a network can help the individual nodes both identify signs of trouble, collude to preventing them from happening, as well as identify and respond to calls for help. Having this option of spreading the burden of care over more people might be one way to nudge more people to engage in caring activities. This is certainly the case for me: the fear of getting entangled in relationships that I cannot get out of is a big obstacle.Three possible situationsI found three possible cases around which we could perhaps better map/make sense of different kinds of caring activities involved.Possibly with the intention to co-design and prototype appropriate practical/organisational settings/resources/artefacts to support care givers/recipients... Case 1: Preventing suicides in the hacker community.Case 2: Negotiating changing roles and needs (emotional and practical) of family members as parents slip into dementia. needs, capacities, and constraints where elderly family members are slipping into dementiaCase 3: Helping refugees deal with emotional /psychological/ social challenges during the "waiting" phases in the asylum seeking process
A number of us got into really deep conversations, which I think everyone needed some time to process. But it is a conversation in progress, so I thought it might be a good idea to continue. Plus everyone's so cool, it would be nice to meetup again :)
... but it seems like a great idea. Where is it? 
You seem to have stumbled into networks as a storytelling technique. Of course all visualisations tell stories, but in OpenCare we are telling stories of collaboration and interconnectedness, so networks work particularly well. Is it worth doing some work on, trying to come up with self-explanatory visualizations?
In writing the proposal, I insisted that people allocate generous travel budgets. The idea is exactly to be present at this kind of event, especially in the early stages of OpenCare. The more we do this, the more serendipitous we will be.  So I would say: yes, Guy, please let us know more. I encourage everyone who is interested to just go. 
I re-read the paper and made myself a map of the story with Tulip, extracting names of persons and/or organizations by hand. The grouped nodes with outer/inner labels is one of the marvelous things you can do with the software :-)
@melancon how did you make it?it's generated or drawn and from what data you found in the article?thanksZoe
https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5-doc/documentation-masters-of-networks-networks-of-care
I'll share a short reflection.  We read your document and discussed it in our team. We agreee with your approach of framing the debate in the intersection between concepts even if we are not so sure to feel comfortable with the subdivision you do in page 1. We think in fact that it's possible to achieve part of what you describe in A1 through tools and processes you describe in B2.  In our activities we experienced that an open system of activation happens especially when people are empowered with knowledge and problem-solving solutions (even complex) and are able to build bottom-up services thanks to the process of co-design and collaboration.   We think that we need to talk about the design and implementation of B2 care "artefacts", for example regarding: - material / immaterial - simple / complex  - low impact / high impact - low growth rate / high growth rate    
Ezio, this is brilliant stuff, thanks. I will be breaking down my reactions into several comments, because I need to read it several times, it is so rich. For now, I would like to refer to your discussion of A1 vs. B2 OpenCare. The "big scary problem" we are looking at is, in my opinion, clearly A1. A1 is what the people out there are trying to do: rigging together DIY solutions to care problems. Where do I leave my children when I go to work, if state-provided daycare centers in Italy do not have capacity (Italy: the slots in daycare centers are 3% of the children of that age)? How do I keep on eye on the glucose in the bloodstream of my diabetic loved ones? Etc.But, OpenCare (the project) is not open care (the activity). We are running a research project. What we research is B2: we reverse engineer how those spontaneous solutions came about. We do it by formulating hypotheses as to what kind of processes the opencarers out there used to invent and deploy their solutions. One hypothesis – that is, at the same time, an enabling condition for our own research activities is what I am going to call the openness hypothesis:Community-driven care solutions correlate with open collaboration and open knowledge management practices. This is very clear in the hacking diabetes story. John Costik wrote code. If he had not open sourced it, the story would have ended there. But he did, so the next guy in the story, James Wedding, could reuse it and enrich the system. But now Wedding's own code inherited Costik's license, so it was open too, and so on. You can do that kind of stuff with proprietary knowledge and top-down permission structures, but you need moneyed organisations. I predict community-driven solutions will depend heavily on openness. Conclusion. We study people who do A1. They will be the backbone of the OpenCare (the project) community. We (the research team) ourselves focus on B2, and hope to learn ways that we can get more A1 stuff out there by showing people how to set their process right. This is why, though A1 is the object of our study, in practice we spend much of our time on B2.Makes sense?
I can't explain why I got it all wrong. Went back to the news article and read it carefully this time. Even made a network map of the story to claim your forgiveness ... (would be even more convincing if animated).
Solo heroes are not what I see, Guy. One guy writes code to upload the data to the cloud. Someone else reuses it. A third person starts a systematisation of the code to create an open source ecosystem. Then that ecosystem is enlarged to drive a pump, so you get an open source artificial pancreas. Then the insulin... I see it as very collective!
Great, great story.It is however reported as a solo heroic strive rather than as a community effort. The article does mention the "biotech hacker space Counter Culture Labs", and then the Open Insulin project, but makes it sound as if the individual initiative were what mattered in solving the situation.I would be interested to know more about the story, and learn about the collective effort that was put in. (Although it could well have been the result of individual effort after all.)On "where to put this stuff", I suppose we should start archiving these stories somehow. My guess is a wiki would do it ok (but I understand ER wikis have been used as single page wikis most of the time). A (collection of) hackpad (or anything similar) would probably be fine.
It was great to meet you Dora, you guys are really impressive and we hope we'll stay in touch. I have not seen pull requests yet...
Hi there, thank you so much for the event, it was a nice experience!Our Wikipedia code is a branch of the spaghetti-open-data GitHub repository. The branch is called "dev-moe" and I think Moe has already sent a merge request.You can browse the code here: https://github.com/FuturoAnteriore/visualizing-self-diagnosis/tree/dev-moeCheers! 
Great work, @RossellaB. I have made some improvements to the hackpad myself. The main thing we need now is the code for the Wikipedia track by MoE and Dora. 
Hi all,It was really great meeting you today! I have written a report on the spot on the hackpad for this group.Please have a look and make adjustments.Enjoy the rest of the meetup and see you all online soon!Rossella
I am not that used with Linux myself.Did you have a look at the sourceforge forum? In case you do not find proper help, please send email to Patrick Mary , cc'ed to me. He is the main engineer in charge of Tulip.Guy
am having problem with installing tulip on ubuntu...am still new with ubuntu so might need some help. will try again in the morning though
To those of you who plan to attend to Mn4, and more particularly to those I expect to actively "play" with networks:@Alberto @Hazem @dora @MoE @RossellaB -- I must be forgetting someone ...We will be using the Tulip network viz framework. Tulip can be downloaded from its homepage (follow the download link). Other options are also possible, but we might enjoy Tulip's python scripting capabilities. The Tulip API is quite intuitive, although the doc could be improved. I'll be there to help.Here is a file you could load after installing Tulip (install is easy, unroll the .exe or .dmg depending on the OS you are using). The file contains users, posts and comments, together with associated tags. All networks in this file connect different types of entites, users to posts or comments, comments to tags, etc. That's why it is named "bipartite".Our task will be to explore how we may then model interaction between users, inferred from the available traces (comments to posts, by whom, etc.).Once we have a user-to-user file, we will then want to use Detangler to inspect tags around which interaction takes place. I plan to make some code available to ease the process of producing Detangler files from user-to-user networks built with Tulip.
@MoE @AlbertoYes, multiplex. I find this a convenient concept, probably more buzzwordy than deep -- anything is multiplex if you think about it ... it depends on what you are ready to term a layer ... We'll have plenty of time to chew about this.You got things right. There are several ways to compute similarity between entities described by a "bag of words" (which you can actually see as embedded in a high-dimensional vector space ...). The better your index (words associated with entities), the better the similarity measures, from which you usually derive a topology by linking similar enough entities. As for the pagecount, I would expect larger time span to lead to somehow uniform pagecounts over all pages, while finer time spans may indicate when/if pages are simultaneously consulted.The link structure you consider, the similarity measure you computeIt all depends on what question/task you are supporting.As I see it, you have done quite a lot of work and will be bringing fantastic material to the workshop. This may well open the door to interesting future collaboration. I mean, people usually get together to finish up what has been done during the workshop, sometimes ending as blog posts, repots, or even scientific publications. In this case, my feeling is we may have things to say to the academic crowd. @Alberto?
I had no idea that was called a multiplex network but I googled it and, yes, it looks exactly like what I was thinking.When I mentioned a 3D visualization, I had in mind exactly this:where each coloured layer is a language, each dot is a page, each link between pages sybolizes a semantic affinity. @Alberto we're on the same page, right?Regarding @Alberto's and @melancon's concerns about time, I agree. The whole process might not be trivial nor quick.On one end, that's why I hoped we would have had more than 2 hours of programming; but after what @Alberto replied, I think it is reasonable to think of a simple proof of concept (we choose one question and prove via code how we "could" provide an answer). If that proves to be worth it, I/we can invest some more time the day after, to extend the code and produce something more meaningful.On the other end, I was trying to produce as much code and db data as I can, to have a good base to start with (and to share with everybody else, obviously).So far I have most of the code in place to do the data mining. I had to go through a few iterations, as we have limited db storage (free account on mongolab) and I needed to find a way both to do quick grouped queries and to store the results efficiently enough. I think I'm pretty close: I could store around 25K entries in around 6Mb (of 200Mb we are allowed) in a few hours. These entries count 4.5K English pages and all their available translations in any language. This means that within 24h we should be able to populate the db with all the pages, from scratch.This does not include the page counts, though, which require a separate query and I'm still figuring out if there's a way to optimize those (ie. not sending a query per page).I'll test this later or tomorrow, but I'm confident I can get decent results in reasonable time.This partially answers @melancon's question about what I'm storing. In terms of page counts, both because of time and storage restrictions, I was thinking to store sample counts for a given period (ie. 1 month of pagecounts, per day), instead of a tighter sampling.I thought that, for the sake of demonstration, any timeframe can be used to prove the concept, and we can assume that the real measures will then take place on more accurate/representative data.Do you think it is acceptable, as an assumption?Does it still sound too scary? I trust your judgement guys, seriously
Thank you for the explanation Guy, now it starts to make sense. I know more or less what a force directed layout is, although I'm not familiar with the maths behind it. 
@MoE this is great news. I didn't dare put that forward for MoN4 as I fear I would not be able to keep up to my promise.It's seems you have already done part of the work, and about all of the thinking. Then go ahead, I'll register to your session :-)I am quite sure I will learn from your experience. And if I understood correctly, you already have put up a db registering pageoucnts on an hourly basis -- all great news.Looking forward to see you in Brussels next week.
The mentions module started acting up after we upgraded the site to the newest version of Drupal Commons and is currently disabled. See here. 
I think I understand. You want to do two things.A multiplex network of pages connected by links. The multiplex part takes advantage of wikidata: we know that "influenza" in English is the same thing as "grippe" in French through Wikidata. So, we can follow all the links from "influenza" and all the links from "grippe"; these will induce two networks, one English-speaking and the other one French-speaking". The networks might be different, and we can analyze that difference. In practice, you have a multiplex network in which each language is one layer of the multiplex.A page count exercise. Page counts have a separate collection method, that we discussed and fiddled around back in 32C3.If both exercises are successful, you have a multiplex network of medical pages in Wikipedia, each of which is associated to a number in terms of page counts per unit of time. You could then map this information onto the network, even visually:What I like about the approach is that it is relatively simple to compute correlation coefficients across different versions of (medical) Wikipedia. Correlation betweeen two languages is high if the probability of being connected of two random pages in language A, conditional to those two pages being connected in language B, is close to 1. Notice that you could do this without even looking at page counts! It seems like a lot of work for one day of hacking, but if that's what you want to do, go for it. 
Seriously, I hope I didn't give the wrong impression. I can only appreciate the organic way topics naturally adapt, here on ER, depending who's active in the discussions. I wasn't for a while, so it's legit that the topic might have faded in favour of others :)I was asking, simply because I had spent some time on the Wikipedia thing and I thought something interesting could be observed (or we could at lease try). I tried giving a hint of my thoughts above, as a reply to @Alberto. I'd be happy to hear what you think.Peace :)s  t  e
Hi @Alberto (I have often problems with mentions' hints not appearing, and therefore such mentions not being recognised; is it a known issue or is it just me?)What you say makes sense and is reassuring. I'm trying to re-organize the several proofs of concept which we put in place with @dora, to have a unified simple tool that we might use to query wikipedia and store responses to a database, for later visualization.Based on what we managed to fetch via the API, here's what I was thinking:* we have a list of the medicine pages* for each page, we can query the pageviews, the links to other wikipedia pages and the translations into other languages* for each link to other wikipedia pages, we can tell whether they're medicine pages or not; if they are, we can record they're semantically connected* for each page translation we can repeat the above queries and store the relative dataWith the stored info we could try to analyze:* which pages are connected, assuming their sub-network might represent a certain topic* which pages (in absolute and relatively to a certain sub-network) have most views* for each topic or sub-network, what is the weight of a specific language in the overall page countThings we might learn:* higher page counts of certain topics might represent higher interest and/or practice of autodiagnosis for such topics (I'm aware that what's actually relevant is how to tell between the two but we can investigate this further)* existance of page translations in certain languages might imply a geographical and/or ethnographical relevance for certain areas and/or ethnies* higher page counts for a certain topic, in a certain language, might be relevant tooThinking of Edgesense and ways to use it (maybe) differently than what it was designed for, we might have nodes representing pages as "semantic knots" (more than "bits of conversation") and connections representing their semantic affinity. Edgesense could then be used to analyze whether the sub-regions it finds match the ones we found as wikipedia's internal links (mentioned above).We could also visualize page counts for each sub-region and each node, both as a global count (including all languages) ans as a "filtered" count, per ethnographic group.Finally, if we imagine this visualized in three dimensions, we might have:* a planar XY mapping, with all the English medicine pages, where all connections are visualized and semantic sub-regions are highlighted (the distributions of nodes in 2D space wouldn't necessarily have a geographical meaning)* a Z layering, where at each depth/height we have a "language plane" which shows which of the English pages are translated in a certain languageConnections would exists across layers, giving a "volumetric" representation of medicine semantic networks.I guess this last bit might sound particularly abstract or confusing, until I manage to sketch a graphic prototype. I hope I'll be able to do it soon, on paper at least, to try explain the idea a bit better.If anything of what I wrote makes sense to any of you, let me know :)
Hi @alessandro-contini,please join, I'll be more than happy to have you on board, I am most sure you can contribute with great design ideas and/or improvements, and even paper mock-up!d3 is so great, would be nice to have some of our stuff put up on the web too.See you in Brussels next weekGuy
@MoE, to what @melancon writes I would like to add two things.First, this is a hackathon, and that means we enjoy a lot of freedom. If you have done preparatory work on Wikipedia data, you are more than welcome to lead a track on Wikipedia data! We'll treat it as we treat the other tracks – in fact, I might drop my quality challenge and join it myself. We also reserve the right to keep hacking into Sunday – I'll definitely do it if we really get going.Second, the time limitations will be mitigated by several factors. The first one is good preparation – join the MoN4 call right now to find out more.  The second one is the usual trick of all hackathons: we just stay in touch (through GitHub and other channels) and finish our work in remote. The third one is the LOTE5 freedom that I mentioned above. We should be OK.
Hello!I'd like to attend the session and I think my skillset will be a good fit for the viz or interpretation team:- paper prototyping / brainstorming- D3js (HTML, CSS)Looking forward to join and hack :)
Hi @MoE,you are right, we decided in the end not to include anything about Wikipedia/data in the final program,mainly because we feared there wouldn't be much to investigate. The motto for MoN is to have clear domain questions together with data, and then mine and visualize the data in ways that can help refine the questions, then iterate until you reach some sort of answers.We had also included the EdgeRyders conversation data from the beginning, in order to also have a chance to look at this type of data -- although what we have for the moment is less concerned with care. It is that type of data OpenCare has planned to deal with (people interacting and discussing issues -> socio-semantic network).Pagecounts did not seem to offer a tangible opportunity to look at how people perform self-diagnosis. So we (@Alberto and I) had to decide not to include them in the final MoN program.--Now, regarding your comment on the risk of being "shrinked" by time ... well, it is real. Previous MoN sessions expanded over two full days. This time, we had to cope with lots of constraints both on the OpenCare and LOTE5 side. To help with this, I will make data available later today, hopefully with some code snippets, so we can save time and still do some work.Hope this helps.
I finally took some time to read thorugh the most recent program and comments and I am a bit confused...We started having a plan, with @dora, about what could be done with the Wikipedia data we managed to mine but I see there's no mention of Wikipedia at all, in this page, so I was wondering whether you're giving up on that end or it was just left aside for the moment, or... ?Again, I'll be catching up with the code stuff this weekend. In the meanwhile, I'd ask: are you planing to have just 2 hours of prototyping for the proof of concept? Ain't it a bit too shrinked?I see that properly structuring ideas is the most relevant aspect of the hackathon, but I fear that not having enough time to make them into proper, working pieces of code might risk to end up producing mainly fluff... I hope I won't sound harsh in saying this, I would just hear what's your take
Most people haven't signed up for sessions. We expect >130 people to come to LOTE at one point or another (hosts included).Come Friday morning, everyone who is there (say 60-70: we don't have precise information) will pick between this session and the one on open source collaboration. Seeing how much more popular this one is, you might end up with a crowded room. Just saying, have chairs prepared to be moved around.
Based on what?On the Edgeryders event: 23 registeredOn the Facebook event, 40 registered – but, as always, some people will not show up. I know for sure Medhin Paolos is not coming, for example. Maria Wahlberg, same thing. What information sources do you have? I ask so that we can take steps.
Just a quick fyi. @Alberto it seems there are plenty of people coming over to LOTE for the Collaborative inclusion workshop alone. I suggest you have a clear policy at the door or at least allow the morning session more people in. Maybe I'm wrong, but we need to be prepared.
Another useful reading if we intend to work with Edgeryders data from spring 2014 is this Spot the Futue report containing visualizations of the network: http://www.renoust.com/pub/STFNetworkReport.pdfI'm not adding it directly in the wiki because I'm not yet sure that the focus will be on this conversation. It's what I understood from the event page. Looking forward!
... so, on Google Hangout, because you can join them with just the link.  No Skype. 
Is there a tag or something I can grab so I know a post is relevant to STF.I also need to be helped on the ethno posts, which for now I cannot really exploit.We'll talk about all this tomorrow I guess.
I did it for the LOTE event.Unfortunatly I have to fly back to Milan on Friday evening...Lucia will stay for MoN till Sat morning.  
3pm - 4pm and more if necessary.I guess you had a look at the (tentative) agenda, and also saw I wish to give MoN4 a participatory design workshop twist.Do we open the call to all, or keep it between facilitators (@Hazem?), or us two?
Hi everybody,  I'm sorry for the long silence but it's been a long any busy period for me.I just wanted to confirm I'll be attending MoN4 with @dora (we have accomodation sorted).We also made some progress with python, relatively to my last updates on ER, but not recently. I'm planning to get back to the code next weekend and I'm confident I'll be able to give you a better update, then.I can't wait to meet you in person :)Cheers,s  t  e
@melancon, are you free for an hour on Friday, say 15 to 16? I would like to touch base with you on the finishing touches to MoN4.
Hi @RossellaB, good to see you are playing with Detangler.First thing you need to know is that nodes on the left panel (substrates) are the main focus. Those substrates relate to one another through nodes on the right panel (catalysts). Catalysts are the "reasons" why substrates relate to one another. In the demo example, people get connected because they co-participate to political lodges (you may have recognized names from the so-called Paul Revere night ride from the American revolution). The quest is to try to figure out, for instance, who was in a position to reach all of those guys pretty quickly (in order to organize a mutiny before the British authority could counterfeit them).The x, y position of nodes is decided in the following way: nodes on the right panel are displayed using a force-directed layout (ask me if you have no idea what that is). There is no absolute meaning in the x or y value, nodes are just positioned so as to have a readable display. Nodes on the left panel are positionned according to how they relate to nodes in the right panel. The layout attemps at mimicking the layout on the left, substrates are positionned "around" the catalysts to which they correspond (although catalysts are not embedded in the panel. The reason is to make the selection more natural: when you select substrates at the top in the left panel, you may expect the corresponding catalysts to be located at the top in the right panel.The main feature is the easy selection of substrates or catalyst using the lasso.We'll be using Detangler with substrates=people and catalysts=topics, for instance.Enjoy!
I was having a look at Detangler and I don't understand what the coordinates x and y stand for. I can see scatter plots and bar plots but I don't know what they tell about the network. Can someone help me out?
Thanks Guy! That is certainly true.
@RossellaB Do not forget we all were newbies at some point, and will probably remain newbies on so many topics till the end. I am real happy to count you in.Looking forward to code in your company :-)Guy 
@Hazem So you are now officially coordinating the interpretation challenge!Looking forward to meet you at LOTE5.Guy
After a fairly large detour, I'll be doing a "Pressure Cooker" workshop on Sunday afternoon. Originally it was part of this event (I think), but it's now a semi-official spin-off. Smaller, shorter and a tiny bit wilder.If you are interested, have a look at the event here.
I am relatively new to networks, but i'm working on a serious project with networks and i have a background in graphic design and in statistics. I can program in R but won't be able to bring a laptop.I am particularly interested in the visualisation challenge and looking forward at meeting you all!
Maybe ping @Kirst3nF, @whvholst, @Senficon on twitter? 
Could anyone suggest an article or paper written in human language to understand how Europe is attempting to regulate software transparency? It could help in having a more interesting Q&A if we could read the state of the art of the debate. 5-minutes intervention? Zoe 
The list of attendees is going to be provisional at best. Your main audience is the OC consortium. Several people from the ER community will also attend. Some will be more on the data geek side, like @MoE; others will be from the medical space (I spoke to a woman called Claire at the LOTE5 apéro). We'll have to improvise. My solution to this is: we announce clearly what the tracks will be, and people who come will be attracted by the tracks. To share the data ahead of time is a great idea. I suggest a GitHub repo. Take care! The dataset has the whole Edgeryders conversation at the time it was generated, so thousands of posts and well over 10,000 comments. But only those of the Spot The Future projects are coded with semantic information! For the rest, you can draw an Edgesense-style social network, but that's about it. Unless you want to try NLP stuff, which I would advise against because it is a totally different methodological path. 
sure will be there.
Thanks @NoemiHow about teaming up with @Hazem in the morning and then leaving (the most fabulous) MoN4 to join your afternoon session?@Hazem, please let me know whether this suits you.Guy
I'm meeting a Brussels based journalist specialising on EU related news. I'll prepare a first draft of a press release ahead of our meeting tomorrow and ask for feedback. Then once it's cool I'll forward it to some Press/comms people at EC and EU parl. I'd maybe print an A4 and have someone slip it into offices of people working on relevant issues/questions :))
The "Edit" tab is above the LOTE5 logo. @markomanka
Thanks @melancon. The only issue I see is that I have to moderate the European Capitals panel Saturday starting 2PM. I would also recommend @Hazem for the job, as he is joining us for Lote, has been doing previous work with Edgesense and knows the ER network well enough.
...However, I do not find an "edit" option for that event description. Maybe @Noemi can help me?
@markomanka, final effort:update the description of your even accordingly. Highlight that participants are more than welcome to get involved in the discussion with the panelists.add start/end date and timeI will update the program page, confirm with Julia and put you two in touch. Deal?
Sounds terrific to me.
@Noemi, I deliberately put you as coordinator for the interpretation -- without asking you first whether you would like to, or even be available! I only did it based on your past experience of previous MoNs. I know you would do a marvelous job.Guy
@AlbertoI was about to edit the text of the event, but I thought I should double-check -- I admit I have but no experience in organizing things the way it takes place on edgeryders.euI already asked for a list of attendees, thinking I could possibly format the workshop according to the audience. I could probably refine the different challenges accordingly.I thought I should share the data ahead of time for those who wish to have alook at the material we'll be using. I have a set of JSONs, and I also uploaded everything into a Neo4j database. Neo4j is nice because it allows to readily visualize the data without really doing anything special (but install neo4j). Note: the JSONs I have include much more content than what you describe. I guess the few hundreds users and comments you mention were obtained by discarding but items of interest (I see this as being part of the process).
@melancon, my friend: our text is clear and nicely written, but it is not a work program. I added a tentative agenda section. Please look it up and see if you think it makes sense. If it does, assign yourself as the coordinator of a challenge... or maybe let's decide to do only one challenge, so we can hack together!I kind of like the idea of the quality challenge. Input from all participants welcome! @MoE @dora @Betty Gorf @jimmytidey (Jimmy, are you coming?)
... please click on the "Attend" button. While you are at it, please do the same on the LOTE5 event here. @Rossana Torri, can you do it too please? I will explain better the rationale for this when we meet in Brussels. 
I'm in
I see your role as helping to shape questions, i.e. map the methodology we'll be working with onto care in general and OpenCare in particular. 
hi alberto!Can I facilitate even if I must leave at 1 pm?
Funny, I always say the same of you. 
Good. Thanks for helping. You have a talent it would take me yet another life to learn :-)
@melancon, I rewrote your text for outreach purposes. Do change what you don't like. I also had to move the content to a newly created event for technical reasons. @markomanka and @Luciascopelliti, please note that I have enrolled you.  It will be fun! Please click on the "attend" button. Same goes for @MoE and @dora and whoever is interested. @mstn? @maxlath? @danohu? 
No, @Nadia, I'd say no point in waiting. The text is final, except for very minor details. Let's get it out there, reach sold out, then get that news out again: it will energise the speakers, the community, the people interested in the refugees issue, etc. 
Thanks for adding the changes straight into the program, makes our lives easier.
once you share the final text?
@markomanka is this you? 
I'm a bit swamped now, as I have a delivery tomorrow, but will catch up this weekend.I kept working a bit on our stuff with @dora, though, we now can get the different languages for each page too (not sure it is the same solution which @maxlath mentioned; we used the langlinks argument from MediaWiki's API).Also, we started implementing a MongoDB client, to try use solutions compatible with what was used already and to figure out what is the best way to store the mined data, according to how we'll use it at MoN.In the repo I linked above, I pushed a few more scripts and the first attempt to re-organize the code in the form of a tool to ease the data collection step. There's still stuff to do, and much of the code is not polished, but better than nothing :)
Am at an event in Vienna. Email?
how about tomorrow morning/noon?
Hey @NadiaYou can usually reach us egg-heads easily through email if they are "corresponding author" for a publication they made (e.g. address for correspondence : David J. Spiegelhalter, Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, Institute of Public Health, Robinson Way, Cambridge, CB2 2SR, UK. E-mail: david.spiegelhalter at mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk), he is also on Research Gate. Citations oof https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995760_Probabilistic_Networks_and_Expert_Systems would perhaps be worth a look for @AlbertoMarc seems to be not quite eggish enough, but http://harleystreetchildrenshospital.com/consultants/professor-marc-de-leval/ can hopefully relay the message (he is 74 so I don't think he'll be there every day).If any of them agree to come I would love to hear if they have anything to say about the triangle of open care, the performance, and their respective research/experience, perhaps someone also has specific questions for them? @markomanka(Semi)-retired professionals are very often a great enrichment to a discussion... 
@MoE and @dora, Python is good because @melancon likes to use Tulip for network analysis, and Tulip is Python. Contributing coding skills to MoN5 earns you two LOTE5 tickets. Please register here. 
Let me know what time works for you?
@Nadia, let's discuss it - we can do it together
Hi everybody,  I finally took some time to start looking at wikipedia datamining, statviews, etc.I'm still far from doing anything fancy, but at least I'm getting an idea of what can be done easily, and how to use the info collected.I'm focusing on python only, for now, because I'm more familiar with it (@dora too), and because it could be an easy win, in case the data collected is to be managed via networkx and/or passed to EdgeSense.@Alberto, @melancon, @mstn, @maxlath, @danohu, thank you all for the hints you shared. They all made my job easier.so far I managed to fetch pages for a certain project (ie. Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine), gather general info about the page, tell whether links to other pages point to the same project or not, get pageviews.Though, I didn't managed to map english pages to the relative translation in other  languages (is wikidata a better interface for this?).I'm also struggling to find an encoding/decoding logic for pagename strings, which is generalized enough to deal correctly with all the special characters (I'm still figuring out whether I can rely on pageid only).I pushed some code here:https://github.com/FuturoAnteriore/visualizing-self-diagnosis/tree/dev-moe/src/pythonit's just a bunch of sketches, but if you think they might be handy I can send a pull request.Will keep you posted on any progress...
How's trix?Thanks for the heads up, not sure how I would reach them though?
Perhaps there are two people interested in here:https://youtu.be/F59Mog7K7GI?t=1468 Mr. Spiegelhalter and Mr. Leval perhaps? If you'd like it can nudge the info on towards them. Mr. Leval is Belgian so perhaps I could also mention LOTE or some other opportunity for you to meet. His academic publications seem to have wound down so there is hope he has some time...
Well done @melancon! Let's all make sure the code and docs get pushed to GitHub. No urgency, obviously.
Ok, just to report on what I have been able to assemble this week. Thanks to all, @Alberto, @maxlath, @mstn, @MoE, @dora for helping.I am now able to process a query about, let's say some keywords, find related wikidata entities (using maxlath's package), then grab relavant pages in any given (or all) languages,and then obtain pageview counts using tomayac's package (aka Thomas Steiner). Thomas' package however only offers daily counts -- simply because wikipedia does not offer more through their API for the moment. So, as @mstn suggests, we may use a DB that would store these counts (and I understand there is one).I plan to use the daily counts and the code chain so a user could query the counts concerning some disease, for instance. I could then use the count data and feed it back to the user through a d3 visualization.I will certainly have time to wrap this up in the coming days (although I have other code to pamper with a deadline for next Wed, so it may only be ready by the end of Jan).There are tons of other things we could do. It all depends on the task we are supporting. Building wikidata entities into a graph could be useful to guide user towards topics to its initial query, for instance. I'm sure this will be a subject of discussion at MoN4/LOTE5.Best
@mstn @maxlathWow, thanks guys for coaching me and being so reactive and helpful.Guy
to get Wikipedia urls from a Wikidata entity, you got to look in the sitelinks section of your entites. To do this from the API, make sure that you do query sitelinks, either by having "props=sitelinks" in your query (or props=sitelinks|claims|info|...) or no props parameter at all (then you get all properties).So for instance, for Ebola (Q51993), you can query just the sitelinks like so: https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbgetentities&ids=Q51993&format=json&props=sitelinksand get{  "entities": {    "Q51993": {      "type": "item",      "id": "Q51993",      "sitelinks": {...        "dewiki": {          "site": "dewiki",          "title": "Ebolafieber",          "badges": []        }...It's then up to you to rebuild the Wikipedia full URL using those data: "https://#{2 letters lang code}.wikipedia.org/wiki/#{title}"
Hi there, I have a bunch of code I wrote during C3 I should push on gh. I am a bit overwhelmed by other nasty things. I hope to find some time maybe during this weekend.The general idea was the following:1. Fetch medical terms (aka page titles in English) from the Wikipedia project on Medicine. Each term is stored in MongoDB in this form. wikidata field is taken from wikidata by title "1971 Iraq poison grain disaster" (step 2). locales field is fetched from wikidata using max's tool 'fetch by OpenData ID' (step 3). Hours field is calculated using pagecounts (step 4).{ "_id" : INTERNAL_ID, "day" : ISODate("2015-11-30T23:00:00Z"), "wikidata" : { "pageid" : 4094969, "ns" : 0, "title" : "Q4284220", "lastrevid" : 248156717, "modified" : "2015-09-06T00:45:47Z", "type" : "item", "id" : "Q4284220" }, "locales" : { "en" : { "title" : "1971 Iraq poison grain disaster", "hours" : { "0" : 0, "1" : 0, "2" : 0, "3" : 0, "4" : 0, "5" : 0, "6" : 0, "7" : 0, "8" : 0, "9" : 0, "10" : 0, "11" : 0, "12" : 0, "13" : 0, "14" : 0, "15" : 0, "16" : 0, "17" : 0, "18" : 0, "19" : 0, "20" : 0, "21" : 0, "22" : 0, "23" : 0 } }, "es" : { "title" : "Desastre del grano envenenado de 1971 en Iraq" }, "ru" : { "title" : "Массовое отравление метилртутью в Ираке (1971)" } } }2. For each term find OpenData ID from page title. I built the request by hand without max's tool (but what I do is what the new functionality of max's tool does). 3. For each term with a known OD Id fetch OpenData details. In this way we are able to find titles for the same page in other languages. Of course, some languages could be missing. For example, there is no Italian entry for "1971 Iraq poison grain disaster".4. Dump pagecount data and update corresponding entries in MongoDB with count information (only for medical terms).All steps are implemented, but for (3) I am running out of memory and I need another smarter way to do it. I should split the pagecount file into several batches or preprocess terms we are interested in before.The algorithm could be generalised in such a way that pagecounts and terms are updated automatically. I use MongoDB to store (partial) results. Firstly, I need to store partial results somewhere because I can't process the whole thing in a single step and MongoDB is better than files. Then I was going to build a webapp backed with MongoDB with a sort of simulator of Wikipedia hits. I do not know if this could help for now. I will back soon with the code. 
-- Might also be of interest to @dora and @MoE (and of course @Alberto) --I've done quite  few experiments with @maxlath's code which got me comfortable with wikidata's api (and node.js and javascript in general). I do not see how I can easily manage to put my hands on a (the?) wikipedia page associated to a wikidata entry (in a given language) -- I actually do not see why there would be a one-to-one correspondance. One obvious, brute force, way to go would be to grab all html links listed on the right panel of a wikidata entry, but I am looking for a more elegant and efficient of doing things.Also, it seems the pageviews.js package only offers daily page count :-(Any help is welcome.
hi @melancon, nice to meet you :)I'm definitely interested in joining the discussion.I've been following this and several other posts and tweets in the last few weeks; enough to get an idea of what is being discussed and considered. We've been discussing this ourselves a bit, with @dora.At the same time, I admit I didn't have time to give it more attention, nor to start testing or researching myself on anything, just yet. I've been a bit swamped but I'm coming out of it now, hopefully :)Anyways just consider me in, reading and paying attention
Yep, I had located it and I plan to use it as well.I am new to javascript and I am learning as fast as I can to use jquery and ajax. I am trying to put up a small and malleable piece of code I could reuse and modify in the context of Mon4. One issue I cam across is the impossiblity to access out-of-domain content from a client. So I guess I have to design things splitted between server and client side.Your wikidata-sdk and pageviews code could be run on the client, while the server could grasp things such as the list of all pages titles, for instance.Any guidance on how to proceed is welcome. I understand you won't be with us at MoN4 and LOTE5? That's a pity :-)Best, Guy 
a lib and API that could be of interest for your project:pageviews.js : "JavaScript client library for the Wikimedia Pageview API for Wikipedia and its sister projects."
Hi Max (I assume I can call you by that name ...),-- @Alberto @MoE @dora might also be interested to join this discussion, let's form a team heading to MoN4 (apart from @Alberto, I am unsure who will be there with us) --I take "1% rule (aviation medicine)" as title of a medicine page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(aviation_medicine), part of the page referencing all medicine pages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Lists_of_pages/Articles).Using the code snippets you provide on github, I understand I get a URL pointing at the corresponding wikidata entity: https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbsearchentities&search=1%25%20rule%20(aviation%20medicine)&language=en&limit=20&format=20When going to this entity I get a quite disappointing result:{    "servedby": "mw1201",    "error": {        "code": "unknown_format",        "info": "Unrecognized value for parameter 'format': 20",        "*": "See https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php for API usage"    }}or using json format:{ searchinfo:        {        search: "1% rule (aviation medicine)"        },  search: [ ],  success: 1 }It may well have to do with this special page, or the use of the % special character (?). Things work fine when I work out the same snippet with other pages such as the next one ('1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane') for which I get:{ searchinfo:        {        search: "1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane"        },  search:        [                    {                id: "Q423029",                      concepturi: "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q423029",                      url: "//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q423029",                      title: "Q423029",                      pageid: 399611,                      label: "1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane",                      description: "haloalkane refrigerant",                      match:                        {                        type: "label",                                language: "en",                                text: "1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane"                        }                },                        {                id: "Q4545638",                      concepturi: "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4545638",                      url: "//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4545638",                      title: "Q4545638",                      pageid: 4337472,                      label: "1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane",                      match:                        {                        type: "label",                                language: "en",                                text: "1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane"                        }                }        ],  success: 1 }I still have to learn how to properly use javascript and jquery so I can have everything work into a single script, and hopefully output useful visualization of page count timelines, for instance. I am also thinking about a rougher solution, grabbing pageviews data over longer time periods, and then computing similarity measures between pages based on these time evolving page views.As far as MoN4 is concerned, what counts is we are in a position to easily manipulate tis type of data so we can react to questions people have, feed discussions with facts extracted from data analysis, build visuals supporting hypothesis building, etc. 
hello @melancon, I'm interested in knowing where you got blocked once you started using wikidata-sdk and also what to have examples of the urls returning empty results you where mentioning.On the question of the interest of Wikidata to get page view statistics, two things make it particularly interesting:Wikidata being structured data, it can be queried it in all sorts of way using the SPARQL endpoint (for which there is no helper in Wikidata-sdk yet): for instance, here is the list of all beers or subclass of beers in Wikidata (the result in JSON)every Wikidata entities centralize links to Wikipedia pages in all languages (see "sitelinks" in the API results)Wikidata ids are meant to be stable, while Wikipedia titles can changes, making the maintaining your project on the long run harder 
@melancon, I was thinking to combine WikiData entities and page count data as follows.Start from the list of English-language Wikipedia page titles of WikiProject: Medicine. for each page on that list, use @maxlath's tool to get the WikiData item from the title. For example, cholera: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12090use the item to get the titles of all the Wikipedia pages (in all languages) that are about that item. The item corresponding to cholera (12090), for example, refers to 112 pages (in: Acèn, Afrikaans, Alemannisch, Aragonès, Arabic...)For each page associated to the WikiData item, read the number of pageviews in the hourly pageviews stats data dumps (organized by page title and not by WikiData item). Notice that the test we ran at 32C3 (results) did not do this. We estimated 184,000 views to medicine-related articles in the sample hour, but that referred almost only to English-language Wikipedia. The one exception are names, for example the page "Louis Pasteur" has the same title in the Wikipedias of all languages, or at least all that use the Latin alphabet. Also notice that @MoE and @dora would also like to participate in MoN. 
I played with @maxlath code to see how we could use it to prepare for Mon4. The tool is great, thanks @maxlath. I am however unsure how I can use it in a straightforward manner and combine this with page counts, for instance.That is, I foresee the advantage of working with wikidata entities to properly index page content, but having access to the wikidata entities does not solve our problem of counting page visits in an effort to understand how people use wikipedia pages for auto-diagnosis.Maybe @maxlath, because he is the designer of the wikidata-sdk, can help us (or at least me)?P.S. I also have a few questions on how urls returned by running the various search routines can be used. I have unsuccessfully tried to access those urls with my browsers and I sometimes get empty content.
fingers crossed!
The generous @maxlath has just posted a tool that does exactly what we were trying to do in Hamburg: get WikiData entities by Wikipedia article title. https://github.com/maxlath/wikidata-sdk#get-entities-by-wikipedia-titles 
@melancon is a scientist. Rightly, he demands a well-defined question. Here's my take.We investigate the size and scope (both in physical space and disciplinary space) of the phenomenon of participatory diagnosis. Folk knowledge tells us use Wikipedia and other Internet resources to diagnose their own conditions, or cross-check a diagnosis made by a physician. The question is: how widespread is the phenomenon? By looking at pageview counts, we can already get unexpected results. I did NOT expect that 95% of all English-language pages in WikiProject: Medicine would be viewed in a randomly chosen hour. Nor did I expect that the top pages would draw 500 hits in an hour. As we refine the query with geographical and other information, we might learn more interesting stuff.But also, this is a rhetorical move. It is meant to draw attention of policy makers and health professionals on collective intelligence. Wikipedia is built by a community, and used by a community. Collective intelligence is already an important player in care: so, people should pay attention to OpenCare.
Someone else mentioned republica at #32c3, I've never been. Any idea what its like?
I've also some notes about the data structure, that I've to refine and put on github. Hope to do this by tomorrow (taking advantage of holiday in Italy).
I owe you a big thank. I realize I was looking at project counts, which use codes that do not look like page name at all ... Fail/Unfail is also about sometimes being a bit dumb -- but hey, learning is about doing things you never did before :-)We should then be able to put up a process to test a few ideas. I'll report on this thread when I have something new.
but that link lists the pages as, for instance, /wiki/1858_Bradford_sweets_poisoningOnce you chop off the /wiki/, you get the page code, and can look up:en 1858_Bradford_sweets_poisoning 1 19153  
but ... The thing is I'm am not interested in the whole wikipedia but only in the medicine page subset. Now, as far as I could see, I can put my hands on the set of all medicine pages by their names -- but not their ... code ...Since the page counts are given using a map code -> count, I do need the code for the medicine pages to filter out counts of the medicine pages.?
do you really need the whole map code  page?For a first attempt, I'd assume starting with just english wikipedia -- so you just filter the dump down to en, and interpret them as en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[pagename]
@AlbertoI spent time looking at wikipedia pagecount dumps to see how easy/difficult it would be to build a DB to get on with this project -- at least try things to see how feasible it is.I spent time looking for the wikipedia domain and page coding scheme. Reading about how page counts are stored, I understood pages get coded into shorter sequences such as en + Main_Page to stand for en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page. But I didn't find any place where I could access the whole map code  page.Anyone has ever come across this piece of information?
@Alberto I actually answer my own question ... I went on the github repository and read the document you posted. I see the line of reasoning you have, the strategy you envisage. What I miss is the information you expect to get from analyzing the data. That would for instance help me figure out a possible viz. Digg indeed is a good idea. But that all depends on what you want to find, or what service you hope to deliver from digging into the data.
@Alberto How are things going, is there a chance we could use this in Feb?
Well done Marco, @Irene Lanza & Henrik. And welcome on board to Irene, new Edgeryder.I've only heard of teaching echolocation "manually" via examples like Daniel Kish's ("Batman") school for children. And through handheld devices and more recently a mobile app (?), but those are mediating the environment, as you rightly point out. Kudos for the open approach, and thinking about community members who might be interested in this.Maybe Alison Smith from Pesky People..? hm.
So I'm available to better understand the project and participate if some activities are envisaged.
more to explore the event, participate to interesting topics of the program especially related to Opencare areas.We've never been to C3 so actually we'd like to be more focused on listening and learning,  taking notes on relevant things, asking questions and meeting people. bestZ 
The only thing I declined was Nadias offer of accomodation since I'm staying with my sister. 32c3 might be a good opportunity to collect examples of existing projects?I can make a presentation on quasi-markets, non-monetary (non profit) incentives for innovation and dissmination of knowledge (when the price system cannot be used, as in public sector settings).

Very cool.
Unfortunately I would still be in Warsaw that day, where I accepted to serve on a panel on research evaluation for the Polish Government.I am more than willing though to have a wide and wild conversation with whoever will go to Paris, about anything he/she might feel to miss, that I could provide.
...having looked at the agenda, it does seem to be an extremely academic-medical event, where I may well just not be able to keep up, and it really needs somebody like @markomanka to be able to discuss opencare in that context?
I'm going to be in Paris during COP21 anyway (wearing my OpenOil hat). So I could attend, though others in the community are better informed about the issues.I'll register anyway, but in the hope that somebody else will be able to join or replace me. [It'd also be a good chance for a face-to-face meeting with those of you I've not yet seen in person] 
It's really beautiful! Once data are open, people can do things with them. I am trying to involve in OpenCare some people I know in Italy who are committed to open data in health care. Of course, it's a legal minefield, but there you go .
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gaza-doctor-tarek-loubani-creates-3d-printed-stethoscopes-to-alleviate-medic..."A doctor in the Gaza Strip who was faced with the fallout of an eight-year blockade in the territory has taken matters into his own hands and created a low-cost stethoscope with a 3D printer....Doctors who have tested out the equipment have said it is as effective as stethoscopes by leading brands, despite being a fraction of the price.Audio tests have also shown that the Glia stethoscope was on par with the leading model on the market, the Littmann Cardiology III." 
Hi all,interesting example, the self-organizing of the greeks.I would push the concept a bit further.Some years ago, I listened to a talk by John Thackara about how hospitals and clinics were becoming unsustainable for many reasons and he explained how we should move forward and think about a distributed type of care, re-design care without hospitals. The talk I'm sharing with you is the one he did at Mayo clinic and it's worth a watch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRMYGBNIv_4(here's a infovis he shows in the video about Obama Care http://kevinbrady.house.gov/uploadedfiles/obamacarechart.pdf )He explains how ninety five percent of healthcare happens outside hospital or the doctor’s surgery - in the home, and in the community. Collaborative service networks are emerging- from child care, to dementia support - that empower people to work in equal and reciprocal relationship with professionals and without needing hospitals.He also gives the example of Cuba and how they spend on 5% of what americans spend and reach the same level of health.Then shows how he applied design thinking in UK working on Alzheimer and dementia and starting from the point of view that health and wellbeing are properties of social-ecological-context and not a something you "deliver" like a pizza. Communities need to be nurtured and supported and it's by being "in them", not by doing things "to them" that change happens.I didn't have time to look for documents of his research, but im sure there's something more on the topic, we could collect.bestZoe 
It's such a simple idea. Why isn't it everywhere?
Although "practical" is perhaps not the right word. Maybe they were too practical...The mode of operation for many organizations is far from entrepreneurial, and generally their structure and interaction/decision modes reflect that. So there's a good chance that some were interested, but thought that interfacing would be a major pain. In some cases possibly true. In many though probably not. ER is probably more flexible in this respect than they believe possible for a respectable organization. :) Perhaps one should put in a slide addressing this at some point, or just highlight that we've worked successfully with the UN or some such.Generally though, even if your presentation is received well - it usually won't look much like that (see my other comment). Absence of bitching is some of the highest praise you can expect (directly) in many such instances. They may very well have tagged you on their radar and will now follow you for progressive/future evaluation (what I did was very similar). If you're still around in 5 years you must be doing something right. Unfortunately this is not necessarily a helpful (or innovative) mindset with respect to something like the refugee situation. In the health system I would actually expect this risk aversion to be particularly pronounced.What probably won't hurt is call up 1-2 places that made a goodish impression to you to see if one can find more common ground. If you like I can help with that.
Particularly in the school context, where this can be found increasingly as you go to the lower levels. Perhaps part of this is because traditionally a career in education avoided many of the uncertainties you would have to face if you "went out into the world". So it often attracted these kinds of people (notably among others).Of course this does not apply across the board. Big groups are rarely as monolithic as they look. But in general I would go in with Ton's assessment. Of course @Alberto has a point too, particularly for sub-currents that may make up most of the edge. They may vehemently want to distance themselves from the mainstream. Generally though I believe operative the term is "(semi) consensus democracy". Basically, you only move when everyone agrees. Or when there's only a few shrill voices left, ignoring which won't cost you much authority (in case they were right after all). That way you avoid making punishable mistakes. There are certain circumstances (and levels of authority) where the system can switch into another dynamic though. E.g. reunification, Fukushima*, and now the refugee situation. Usually this is when there is consensus that there is no consensus - and waiting for it to arrive would very probably be very bad.I believe at such a time the normal channels become much less relevant and the effective deciding bodies smaller, and less restricted by convention. When Merkel did a 1 h talkshow this was the signal (in case you had missed it) that we are in "Neuland" (uncharted territory) once again.*This is not strictly true, but that is a long story.
@ton@ton, I had no idea this was an issue. It's counterintuitive: Germany clearly works somewhat, if that was their standard reaction would it not be completely paralysed? 
The workshops for the different presenters ran in parallel so I couldn't go to any of the other ones and get a sense of interest/participation. My impression is that it was very much a "give me some tools I can go to the office and use tomorrow" kind of crowd. I can say that no one from any of the organisations with whom I can see space for collaboration participated in my workshop. Not sure how to interpret that. Some options:a) the contents where too new, abstract or badly communicated.b) my presentation did not give the impression I am credible enough to engage withc) the contents of my talk were not practical enough so they didn't think they could get anything actionable from itd) something else
I found doing presentations / workshops on creating change in policy areas like education and administrative transparency in Germany often resulted in "yes, good ideas, but for that we would need to change the constitution, so it's not going to happen", even when talking about small scale probes/experiments (like what a teacher can do in her own classroom). I interpreted that as a fig-leaf for inaction. Curious to hear if you encountered any of that. Or, hopefully, it was a crowd more vested in doing what is already possible now while eyeing the more fundamental changes to come.
Personally, the politics label would scare me most. But then I'm from Germany, so in your shoes I'd have been a bit apprehensive to say the least. I'm sure you did a good job though (which is something you won't be able to read off this crowd easily).There is a nice joke on this, but it is of course not PC and doesn't work as well written down... Next time we meet perhaps. :)
I hope (and expect) all went well! :)If you have some time @Nadia it would be cool to know what kind of crowd you ran into there. Also I heard there is a twitter account up now? Would you like to get a bunch of links you can retweet? E.g. things like this: http://www.nature.com/news/consider-all-the-evidence-on-alternative-therapies-1.18547 this should tie in well with our thought on the placebo thang.
Hello all,The outline/narrative arch of the keynote presentation is now online.  I need your help: how to get certain points across simply and convincingly?https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-hXaTOV6-PI1OKi4WLFIsAO8zmxCNyM2A6YuzgG1Rlc/edit?usp=sharingPlease go in and add images & help with content by adding information to the speaker notes. 
frame the potential impact of OpenCare approach and be used as a practical example because a lot of people have been in touch with the issue.It's one of the field where bottom-up solutions can be developed and co-designed by a wider audience, involving families and specialists.I'm not sure if it can help but I've just read an article about a recent Dementia care conference, here's some interesting bits:Peter Rabins — director of the division of geriatric psychiatry, school of medicine, at Johns Hopkins University - says that in US, it’s projected that about 16 million people will have Alzheimer disease in 2050. Today, every 67 seconds, a dementia case is found. It is estimated by mid-century that that will happen every 33 seconds because of the aging population.Between 60 percent and 90 percent of people with dementia also have behavioral or psychiatric problems that come from the disease. And about 98 percent of people “want to live at home with dementia,” Rabins said, “Not everybody can. "The goal in Alzheimer’s disease treatment, he said, is rehabilitation. “What do rehabilitation specialists do?,” Rabins asked. “They figure out what can the person no longer do, and then we give them an aid. If someone needs a cane because they’ve had a stroke and they are weak on one side, we give them a cane. If they need a walker to be steady, we give them a walker. “But equally important, they also figure out what can the person still do. And our goal here is to maximize the person’s functioning independence.”----------------More than the distinction between commercial / non-commercial , i'd use the distinction between profit/not profit .  Open doesn't mean free.I think that public health is like public transportation, if the focus is profit, it doesn't work properly. In the world we'll have 75 millions with Alzheimer disease in 2030 and 135 millions in  2050
is about:https://edgeryders.eu/sites/default/files/688670-OPENCARE-Evaluation%20form.pdfDoes someone else have a better wrap up for people who are new to this but want to help?
I would like to leave the event with 1. a SWOT analysis 2. understanding of how to position the OpenCare project in commercial and non-commercial contexts3. preliminary handshakes with a number of potential clients/funders Any suggestions for a good strategy for keynote and workshop? Here's where I am working on the slides. 
With regard to general care and rehab I reached out an nudged a couple of people. There is one promising mid-career health professional who will likely be interested - and this would probably coincide well with an upcoming career move too.However I believe language may be a bit of an issue, as I believe she speaks only German on a proficient enough level (she can probably read English fine, and perhaps also has the listening comprehension). If we can "buddy her up" with someone appropriate I'd think it would work out. 
You are looking for high level tools that help foster an open conversation on the subject of care specifically, or rather more generally policy making?The way I read the above it sounds like the talk will be more general, but the results of the workshop should come out with a specific focus. Perhaps a bit SWOT-analysis like?
Nice to see the event coming along @Nadia and @Caroline-paulick-thielI've been working (my ass of) on a few things the last months that you might find interesting- MethodKit for Cities (soon done)- MethodKit for Workshop Planning (CC -> Working docs or the cards in beta to print & test)- MethodKit for Public Health (already released)- MethodKit for Informal Settlements (upcoming CC kit)The new site releasing on wednesday is there -> http://methodkit.wpengine.comBtw, thanks for supporting me on the Toolbox/How thing today Nadia.
I think it is a really good idea. However, we need the "meat" of the talk. The OpenCare proposal helps, but we'd probably need to collect some cases of community driven care services. Also ping @Luciascopelliti.
I've given a bunch of presentations and like to critique and fix them, I know a bunch of people in the scene, and I will very likely be able to arrange for private accommodation in Hamburg for a couple of people.Most of my personal interests are currently not really in a state that lends itself well to a presentation, but if I can use this as an opportunity to finally go to C3 and help someone else - even better.Apart from that, I was playing with the idea of getting a couple of not-usual-suspects to join as well. Specifically I was thinking of a couple of techie women from the UAE and perhaps also someone from the cultural/gender field there. I think this could be an enriching perspective and make for interesting discussions. What do you think?I already have an idea how to dig up a couple of potential attendees/speakers.
Jaromil wanted Amelia and I to do something together but I thought it was a bit vague to be honest. Plus the dates conflicted with my stay in Athens...
@Costantino and @zoescope to go. Maybe we could cook up an OpenCare-related talk with @markomanka? But wait– were you not supposed to do a talk with Jaromil? 
I know, right @Alberto? I used to live in Poland and this was a real issue there. Women had to travel to Germany every time to get an abortion. I was so surprised and it seemed to be such a  hypocrisy considering Poland is in EU and so progressive otherwise.Like people would sin in every possible way - getting drunk, lying, cheating,etc and then go pray on Sundays in the church and consider themselves righteous Christians. So how come abortion is not legal I would wonder?But it doesn't surprise me any more, religious hypocrisy is the same everywhere - also in Armenia/Georgia("cradles of Christianity") and Morocco(a 100% Muslim country).
Thanks @trythis I relax by checking my friends' news feed on fb...i guess i follow the right people ;-)
Whaaat? This is genius... 
It is an extremely good example of the moral and practical challenges faced. And it addresses an issue that in not so far on the male side of the spectrum...Thanks for that - how did you find it?
Here is how drones will be useful in Poland though I know it's not relevant. Sorry not sorry :P
Some inspirations / remarks from our experience:IMHO, the bias introduced by transforming verbatim speech to third person is much bigger than the one by asking questions during an interview. The first influences content, the second only topic (if done right). We had this same challenge in the Future Makers Nepal project. Then @Dipti Sherchan pioneered a solution that consists of first-person speech for the answers of the interview, and first-person remarks and introduction by the interviewer, all combined into a nice narrative format. See the interviews in the Future Makers Nepal space done by Dipti and Annu from our team so far. Could fit for a book format as well.
Also, we need a high quality portrait/photo of each person/people and surroundings for each case study. 
This is important when we write the case studies down. The interview framework is there to be coherent throughout all the case  studies, but how to then write it down is important too. Not only for readability, but also for analysis.And I had some doubts what would be best: all in 1st or all in 3rd person. 1st person is interesting because you get sucked into the narrative of the person self, you experience it from their perspective. But then I thought: that person wasn't the only one in the room. That person was asked questions by another person, and that other person has their on bias which they bring into the room. The same accounts for the person taking notes. And even though the end product will be the result of collaboration between the interviewer, subject and notetaker, for the reader this may not be clear. It may skew our results as well.So what I propose, and let me know what you think, is that we do a combo of both. Almost journalism style. Where the larger analytical and introduction parts are being narrated by the interviewer, and larger other interesting chunks are first person narrated in quotations. As for the final analysis (book), we should introduce all the interviewers/engagement managers and other people involved in the cocreation of the case studies as well. Show bias, to avoid bias.
Easy does it :)I think the "special edition community call" will happen but not as next step. I'll try to assemble some info into a really short pitch - perhaps multiple pitches.Most likely what I'll do is something like a presentation of 10-15 slides with narration of project concepts, and some more explanation in the appendix to get people who are new to the topic onto the same page.If I get the impression we have a fighting chance to reach "critical mass" for some sort of project (with various ways and degrees of participation), I'll try to frame it in a more orthodox way. I'll try to shoot for something that can start small, but demonstrates potential impact, and a path to ramp it up.Regarding "gender / other peoples perception":I'll take one step back.In my opinion drones are at the point where many of the non-innovative, technologically skeptical, and clueless parts of society have decided that drones will play a significant role in the future*. I am not sure how large this part will actually be. I think it is a pretty complex problem, but that is a story for later.Now of course some actors smell a bigger market or faster ROI than others. These are likely to push for funding and policy changes (FAA & EASA), which may end up making alternative routes of development difficult or impossible. As drones have been largely developed in a military environment, this defines the perspective of many of these early players (to some degree) at least.However: We're about to introduce drones into many of our everyday lives - not just over the heads of an enemy army. We need to bring diverse public interests to the table. And we need to involve people into design decisions somehow. The reference to gender was because my impression has been that the female views don't seem to have a lot of traction in this. Nadia gave a good exception - but it has very few views. Here I am not talking so much about a lack of female engineers working on drones (quite a few do). I am more thinking about the global (especially: informal) economic activity that represents a large fraction of economic activity in developing nations. Also, I am thinking of female equality / empowerment / safety aspects which could be addressed more effectively if their voices were represented throughout the process.*Outside of the military.They will definitely play a role on the battlefield - probably an important one. To be honest this is a field I am interested as well, because technology can often make military conflict significantly more "humane" or less "humane". And it often indirectly influences general power structures significantly over time. I think it is worthwhile to look at this - but I also think 99% of the time, 99% of the drones should be busy doing something less ambiguously beneficial. That is what I'd like to concentrate on in the context of edgeryders. If we can tap into bloated and headless defense budgets to do this (and save social budgets for other projects) it may merit a discussion.
@trythis I am just catching up on this thread. It seems to me you are progressing into an initial writeup/pitch. How can we help? Pro tip: I am not sure the community (myself included) will completely understand your hints. What does it mean to "hear other people's perception on this", and "expressly into the social/gender direction"?  For example: do you want to organize a "special edition" community call, taking some time and effort to evoke the "right" people? We could probably help with this.I suppose I could attempt to connect us with the Italian govt. I even have (exactly three) high-level contacts, but they are all in economic policy making, not in defence. I can shoot an email, but I need to tell them what I am looking for. Can you help me understand?
Will get in touch with David Windestål, thanks looks interesting :)Ashley Dara does hardware in extreme environments and has done work in Nepal ping @Matthias. (thank you @Jean Russell for the suggestion). Another one  is Emily Jacobi https://youtu.be/sf-2J0crYTQAnother lead came through a Swedish connection, Will Slackfield https://www.facebook.com/willsackfield
Those were blips that did not make it on my radar before - perhaps because they are more coming from an architect/design/society angle to this. I'll try to see if I can get a quick look inside the book somewhere to judge whether it is worth the money for me. Did you see the BAE ARGUS surveillance video I linked to somewhere? If you used that for city planning/zoning it would be a very powerful tool - for good OR bad. I have difficulties believing we will collectively abstain from it on some moral grounds, especially in large cities. The more security concerned (but bottom-up) side is covered pretty fairly well from here (though the blog slowed down a lot). It still has a lot of good recommended reading.What I'd like to see is more info from the sustainable development and agri crowd. I know of "the reforestation project", but I am sceptical. I am particularly looking for the less formal and organized (lobby) voices. 
This dude is probably one of the ones you'd be looking for:http://rcexplorer.se/about-me/If he has a connection to Saab Aerospace - you'd probably cover a lot of ground on that basis. I have an old Saab connection but it is probably too old (also as in senior) to be worth much: http://www.lighterarena.se/media/177375/pontus_nordin_saab.pdf
although not available for free, these friend of a friend's fictions and reflections on how drones might change culture, behaviour and our relation to physical space in the near future might be good food for thought. I find the urbanist/architect take particularly interesting, since considering how soon-to-be-inconspicuous drones might build/change the function and meaning of a living space feels accessible (both in imagining it, and shaping it, since there's no drone policing/governance yet). 
Ping @hexayurt maybe also @LucasG. I'm quite curious about this and can maybe look for some stuff in Sweden. @Asta has looked at space debris, but maybe she knows of people exploring this. Possibly @Smari will know of people doing relevant work.
But it is a good example of things most would not think of. It also illustrates to what degree a technological "arms race" can influence society, and policies. Apparently they needed a mobile sensor to scan the environment for transmissions into the classroom.
Just came across this article about how the Chinese use drones against cheating during exams. 
I have some 150 pages of recent high-level talk of the established stakeholders at the German government, which I'll start to go through (conveniently linked to from here). I expect this is where we'll most easily identify typical organizational blind-spots and see what the motivation of each of the stakeholders is defined by.If someone could do something similar for France, or Italy (or Britain, or any other place really) I'd be happy to compare our findings.I've also begun to dig into the blog scene of people who know about the military (including technical details) but have remained very critical of it. There are a few and they seem relatively tightly networked - though there's not much commentary. I did another skim of DIY drones, and have lots and lots of technical detail, and a large collection of US defense industry talks which will help understand better how they work in general, and again, provide blind spots, as well as arguments á la: If THEY received THAT amount of funding for this BS, it'll border on criminal neglect not to give us seed fund at least.
@Matthias yeah I am tired of hearing what good drones could do but never seem to get around to actually doing. For example Nepal is not terribly far away from Pakistan where we know there is lots of drones loitering around. Many of them could have hopped over to Nepal with at max one stop-over for refueling in no time flat. I may have missed some (thanks for the link @Alberto ), but so far I haven't seen many of the unambiguously beneficial uses exploited a whole lot. And some of them have been blindingly obvious in the last couple of weeks, and really not difficult to get at least working on.I don't want to belittle the fact that there are many small initiatives all over the place, and in most cases there is a LOT more work going on inside than meets the eye. One of the problems I have though is that if large sums of government money are to be spent on such a technology - that obviously has a significant and very complex societal impact - we don't seem to bother to discuss it in an effective manner. Such an attempt would include the people that make the tech, the people that operate it, and - very important - the ones affected by it. Before we produce all the facts. With drones we are looking at a very wide range of outcomes we could end up with, some of them very difficult or impossible reverse. Also we should be aware of a problem's roots, even when we feel compelled to fight the symptoms. We need to keep track of the externalities of a technology, and stay realistic.At the moment all money pretty much goes exclusively to the usual suspects. How can civil society, at least parts of the "global south", or women's voices be heard and considered in such a process? When would this be done if not in the early stages of making the concepts? Are the current practices established in industry conducive to such a process (large mil ind complex organizations elbowing for money)? How is their track record of managing such programs, that need to stay flexible and permeable to tackle a field full of unknown unknowns (and un-unknow some knowns in the process) - to say it with the words of Rumsfeld and Žižek, respectively.Of course it won't be simple and it won't be without friction, but if I weigh this against the societal cost of opportunity, and ER's chance to help connect and guide many center actors through a very dynamic edge - the problem has our name written all over it. I would love to hear other people's perception on this before I publish the next steps I could envision this taking. I am not only looking at @Marc @francesco210173 @Baptiste Labat but expressly into the social/gender direction (@noemi , @SamarAli , others - it is not super urgent but perhaps you know someone you can nudge when you are a little less busy than you must be now?)
… it's about time drones save some lives and do some good. As for uses for drones in Nepal:Example of drone recon in Nepal after the earthquake (quite drastic HD footage near the epicenter).When we were in Bhorle village in the hills this week, an idea of using drones to connect the villages crossed my mind repeatedly. Their problem is: they are on neighboring hills with a valley in between, just 20 foot minutes or 5 bike minutes apart if there was a straight way, but instead it's 2 hours walking and climbing on rocky terrain without proper tracks or even stairs. I'm pretty sure drones are of no use here and it's just a first-world pseudo-solution … but I still hope they could be used to distribute medicines, small tools and parts etc. between the villages. With longer-range drones, it would be useful even for the very remote villages here (which are 4 days of walking to reach the nearest car-navigable street).For illustration: Photo one of the kids in Bhorle took when we were there. The next village is barely visible in the top right corner. Deep valley and river in between.
The issue of data protection and its breaches in healthcare is rather complex, and not exclusively technical.It would be very interesting to witness a debate sprouting about the sense and scopes of data protection, but what we mostly have is a polarisation around data secrecy, and data sharing.It is not possible to devise a set of rules (arbitrarily complicated) capable of consistently operate across all settings of care and life, remaining aligned with the reasons and goals those data were produced for in the first place.
That page seems to be a sort of fairly abstract description of what any project ought to look like. Its categories are very abstract: "Create spaces", "Map interests", "Create structure" etc. Each comes with deadline and deliverables. Each person running a project would fill in these fields as appropriate – in fact, quite similarly to what happens with European Commission-funded project (they have "Excellence", "Impact" etc.). Also the process people have used in the periscope case is similar: work on a GoogleDoc, then copy-paste into the Sensorica form. The point of copy-pasting seems to give people a way in to contribute (and be rewarded accordingly – kind of like Github + accounting). This is all reverse engineering, I am not actually seeing the accounting (no fields denominated in € or $ or whatever), but that might be due to my non-logged in status.We have a similar system, except no forms. You have a project, you post it as a group on the platform and receive your basic tools for cooperation (wikis, tasks etc.), loosely coupled with what the whole community is doing. This is meant to maximize the chance that somebody you don't know will randomly walk in and turn out to be exactly the person needed for that project. People are encouraged to find their own ay to share, under Who Does The Work Calls The Shots – doers decide.A problem in ER is turning out to be how to reward the quite difficult and not always fun activity of making the sales. Not rewarding encourages waiting around for someone to walk in with a contract; rewarding it seems quite awkward, at least before you have some hard data on what it costs to do that kind of work (accounting for all the failed pitches). How do you guys do it in Sensorica? Does your accounting award a commission to people making successful sales? How much, if I may ask? 
a comment to show interest and followbeen learning a lot since I joined this community :)
So I followed your link and couldn't really make sense of what the contents of that page want from me as a visitor. Are you trying to sell me something? Am I expected to post something somewhere?We are looking at the same problem from different angles. I saw there was a need to put together an overview of how you actually generate revenue because for a lot of people it is kind of a black box. Then you can plug those skillsets into different contexts that operate under different rules. Your Open Value Networks Concept in my mind is one such context: I am looking at all the stuff that happens before a customer arrived at your door stating they want to contract you to do x thing for y amount of money.The background story is that I had a meal with an Italian civil servant who has become friends with three homeless-ish guys in Milan. One of the guys is an Italian aristocrat who spent all his money. The second is a skilled Senegalese metal worker who lost his job as a factory worker. The third is a Maroccan guy who lives out of his car, and is not really specialised in any area.Guess which of the three is doing best?
Hi all, I got captivated by this thread, because this is precisely what we are trying to do at SENSORICA. @Nadia "I am looking at collaborative ways of generating revenue for people working on the kinds of projects that pop up in this community and others. They rarely fit comfortably in existing categories (various mixes of startup, social enterprise, art project, activism, research etc etc) and they often require engineering different kinds social contracts which the same people to move between multiple roles e.g. user, consumer, cobuilder etc. without fear of exploitation. It's tricky. "First, what is the value system? We need to map it first and that will determine how to set everything up for value to be created, distributed and for the benefits to be shared among participants. Second, there is a choice to be made about the type of environment we want to create. Is it about creating value in a corporate-type environment or in a peer production environment. Nadia's words above suggest that something like the second choice is preferred. People like us need to be free, want to contribute to different projects, want to be able to influence and take ownership of processes, want to share... So how do you set up an environment that allows value creation and its distribution but feels like a network and is build on openness, transparency, decentralized processes? This question is at the core of my activities since 2008 and my answer is the Open Value Network (OVN) model. There are a lot of hybrid models that try to go in that direction but preserve some of the old stuff, and I think that is because people are not ready or can't go all the way. Within SENSORICA  all projects are open, everyone can perform tasks, no barrier to value creation, and we use the value accounting system to redistribute the revenue. Networks that have projects formalized as a company, incubators and accelerators for example, don't have a lot of co-creation or exchanges between these entities. Within a value network projects are open and are only loosely formalized. If you have a system to track contributions you'll get a lot of value flows between projects, synergy increases, there is a lot of recycling and sharing of tangible and intangible resources.  We are now prototyping services. A client makes a request, a group forms within the network and use the infrastructure to deliver. Here's one example http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/products/offered-services/barda-periscope-project
Let's build the tasks for people to complete together? When should we schedule the first group call for, next thursday morning work for you?
Yes, I completely agree with the remix.I looked at the way the course is going to be structured. This is indeed great, I like very much the idea of peer-to-peer feedback, and of weekly calls to state the advancements. We were doing this with the crowdmentoring programm that we organized with Babele in October, and it really works :-).My remark regarding the course is that this is great for ideas that were not implemented yet, but it would be fantastic to adapt them to already existing ideas. For example if they already have an MVO, they would still need to figure out if they satisfy needs and if somebody is ready to pay for their service because it's creating value, but the focus, the questions, etc, would be different. What do you think?  
I am looking at collaborative ways of generating revenue for people working on the kinds of projects that pop up in this community and others.

It's tricky. But maybe you want to build this together Ruxandra, as a join Babele Edgeryders project? Here's where the course is being shaped, feel free to jump right in: https://edgeryders.eu/en/how-to-build-a-revenue-stream-to-support-your-activities-p2p-course
Hi Nadia,yes, great post. What you are saying actually is indeed the fact that there needs to be value creation for social purpose driven initiatives.For it to be value driven, there need to be people that are ready to pay for the service.The whole concept of testing with a Minimum viable product (MVP) or Minimum viable Offer (MVO) it's the ideas behind the lean startup philosophy.Test something from users, learn how to identify their needs (because they do not always express them directly) and how to create something that satisfies their needs creating enough value for them to really use your product/service. Etc.I believe there is much to learn from the whole lean startup philosophy for people that want to change the way our world is driven. This is why we were organizing workshops on lean startup and collaborative business modeling (as the one organized in Stockholm). However, there are also limits of the lean startup principles. For example with Babele, we received the true validation of the concept only in October 2014, so 1 year and 2 months after having launched the platform. And we started selling services with the platform only in February 2015 (so 1 year and almost 6 months after). It takes a lot of patience in building professional products and services, and sometimes the lean startup philosophy invites people to give up too soon because they were not able to receive proper validation soon enough...
I have resisted doing this for a while out of time constraints, but it kept popping up as a need. A few minutes after this post went live I started getting emails from people who want to sign up for the course. Perhaps I should have set this up earlier, but as always...time time time.  
What can I say, having learned quite a bit just by watching you work your magic :)@Ruxandra wouldn't this be useful to your Babele team? 
Interesting article of yours, just read it. Thanks for writing it! So, to be a bit heretical, one could say: Political rights are overrated. The only time you need them is if you need political change because of the current government being incompetent or corrupt. And given that the next government in Europe is usually just as incompetent and corrupt as the last one, they are of little use then either. The human rights record of democratic European governments with respect to creating a humanitarian crisis in Greece is also not that good :D In fact I'd like to see some statistics about what caused real betterment in democracies: Election-induced changes, or extra-constitutional changes?However, it's not yet decided. The latest Greek developments and the upcoming Spanish elections make me hope that elections can indeed (at times) be the peaceful, orderly revolution that we were always taught they are meant for. And where this works out, it's just great, literally a lifesaver.I'm taking too much though. Good night!
On the subject of things being in the process of improving in Ethiopia, I have written my own account of that journey. I was stricken by the "Chinese syndrome" of a technocratic government with a fairly poor human rights record which is, however, quite accountable and successful, and enjoys a high degree of consensus. For a Westerner, this can be unsettling! 
Just read up on modern Ethiopian history, since I didn't know anything about it. Interesting. The civil war story is sadly the same mess that state politics is everywhere from time to time :( (Newest European example being Ukraine.)"Here and there, what we think of as religious and or ethnic conflicts are often intimately tied to underlying conflicts over resources like land or water." – To the point. Religious and cultural affiliation is often simply a lobbying / collective action tool for mundane interests.
just realized I left the tab open without writing a comment here as I told u @Noemiwould like to learn more about the process of community "managing"  and get a clearer picture by joining the team :)------from the 1st of August I will know more about how to manage my time to put more into this .looking forward to "continue" collaboration with you
need a few moments to maybe make a flyer for this!
This is fantastic work, [Noemi]. Thank you so much for taking the time to write it. I posted a link to it in the e-mint mailing list (watering hole for professional community managers). I absolutely love it for its freshness and simplicity.
Hi Noemi :) I would like to help with all this (of course)I also enjoy a lot doing this, and I have learned a lot about the cool things about community 'management' in edgeryder's style :) with you over the last weeks and months :) but I would like to learn more and we are always learning by doing ... and I would be very happy to be more in touch with yourself as part of the package :) Hugs :)
There is a growing :) movement in Poland, that originates from urban food cooperatives (buying food straight from local farmers). A natural step up is to get into long-term relationship with one of farmers and combine her/his proficiency and land with enthusiasm and labour of cooperatists. In most developed cases (Freiburg, Germany for example) the cooperative owns the land and some of cooperatists are professional farmers, running the production. In Freiburg (http://www.gartencoop.org/freiburg/) every coop member spends 4 days per year working on the farm, plus some support for food distribution, plus paying share of cost coverage.As a result they set up a well-balanced system, where, without commercial relationships, everyone has their needs covered. The completely excluded State and City Hall from their loop, which personally pleases me the most. ;-)Anyway, going through the model of Community Supported Agriculture seems to be a way to lower the treshold between guerilla gardening and serious food poduction. And you need no-one to give you anything - it is purely a win-win system.
The "Protestant work ethic" of the working classes sounds like a typical form of authoritarianism, in which the resentment of the powerless against the powerful is sublimated instead into resentment against those who manage to evade their power.
My uncle occassionally writes for a magazine called The Idler. From their wikipedia page"[a] characteristic of the idler's work is that it looks suspiciously like play. This, again, makes the non-idler feel uncomfortable. Victims of the Protestant work ethic would like all work to be unpleasant. They feel that work is a curse, that we must suffer on this earth to earn our place in the next. The idler, on the other hand, sees no reason not to use his brain to organise a life for himself where his play is his work, and so attempt to create his own little paradise in the here and now."His life is suspiciously like a big game and he is a pleasure to be around.I think that its very important to enjoy yourself :)  Also, like apparently many other Edgeryders, to stand back and think what it is you really want to do/achieve in life, rather than concentrating on a "good" well paid job with "good" career prospects.
There has always been work, in the sense of transforming human effort into subsistence. But that's only been organized in the form of "jobs" for a comparatively short period. And the main reason for that was that the shift in the First Industrial Revolution from production primarily with general-purpose, individually affordable craft tools to production with extremely specialized, expensive machinery in factories. The result was that only associations of the very rich could afford the factories, and then they hired propertyless proles to work the machinery for them on terms set by themselves. Today, with open hardware micromanufacturing, permaculture and open-source information production, that trend is being reversed -- most production can be carried out now with individually affordable tools. It's mainly patents and copyrights, and other state-enforced monopolies, that enable the corporate dinosaurs to retain control over access to the means of production. So we need to destroy the power of the corporations (by ignoring their monopolies and rendering them unenforceable) and the concept of the "job" along with it, and shift work into household self-provisioning and the informal and local economies.
May be the point here is "job" VS "meaningless job I hate".Rushkoff has a good job.
have no holidays :( 
thanks for your comment! I agree that the first step is unlearning our mindset and get rid off the values that tie us to organize work in jobs. I certainly will read the work of Rob Black for this. to be continued...grtz Carlien
Yes, you do have some good pointers on existing ways to achieve data interoperability. Yet as a coder, I mostly have to agree with Alberto: data is still sooo messy these days.The only thing worse than no standards is too many standards, and we seem to be in this time of evolving standards. People are trying out new data formats and richer forms of representation, and that's ok - it will take some more years before the mist clears up.We could be faster with this cleanup if the first thing everyone does when involved in an open data related project is agreeing with the global community on a common solution before implementing something own. But then again, grassroots decision mechanisms for agreeing on global data standards are missing ... . So far, a standard confusion cleanup happens mostly when one ingenious and hard-woring single project's group produces the biggest and best data set in their area, and others take it over.In our startup, we're using Freebase as one source of open data (in this case, about products, but they also deal with everything else). Just one example of the standard mess, as they develop their own data structures - but it's one of the larger examples, so maybe some of their proposals will be accepted as industry standards one day.So, there's still a lot of work before we reach full data automation :)
Found this just now and thought I'd add a thought to the mix :)The "job" concept is just one of the ways how a society can organize the distribution of resources and work. It's the most petty one of all. Apt for those who want to profit from eymployees in a mechanical way which does not have to imply any generosity, care or adherence to society as a whole. This petty joy-based accounting of course also binds much resources just for accounting itself ... and for checking that the employees work ...But now that "we" as Western society have taken hundreds of years to develop and refine this accounting based system of paid jobs, and all of us got raised in it, I doubt it could easily change on large scale to something like the communal work found in some African tribes. Or just to basic income - we have that discussion again in Germany, but it's stuck in its infancy. We're infected with a renitent meme and have no quick way out (as a whole society, not as individuals).But the first step is unlearning this mindset and these values that ties us to organize work in jobs. Once, I found a great classic article that really helps to do so. It's quite sharp and exaggerating (and hilariously funny), so everybody take it with a grain of salt. But for recognizing just how much my own mindset was tied to the job idea it really helped:Rob Black: The Abolition of Work
Hi Darren,A couple of thoughts:(1) At Access Space we have put active thought into how t include people who are UNLIKE us. We have a protocol for greeting newcomers (the 10 second rule) and we concentrate hard on trying to accommodate people who come from a completely different mindset. There are all sorts of reasons why it's clever to do this - a diverse social network has greater perspective and greater collective intelligence (see James Suroweicki). However, the action of doing this over an extended period is REALLY hard work, and needs to be done well.If you'd like to understand the Access Space formula, check out our comic book "Grow Your Own Media Lab": http://bit.ly/GYOML(2) Artists are particularly interesting people in demographic terms - their lifestyle, outlook, and society's perception of them allows them to connect vertically, linking people from different socio-economic groups. The biographies of many artists show that they hang out with princes and paupers, bankers and beggars. As well as running Access Space, I am an artist, and I wonder whether this gives me a particular license to link with diverse people.I hope this helps!Best regards,James 
These mass movements appear to cut across many social groups and although often not as visable as they were continue spawn various projects that build social infrastructure
Two examples immediately jump to my mind,Although I'm not sure how much either one cuts across different social networks.Transition (Towns) Network - Often is accused of being white and middle class.Co-operative Integral Catalonia - which is, I guess, primarily attracting people with reasonably radical political views.Also some community food projects attract a reasonably varied demographic - one I go to often has children who have been excluded from school participating, they attend with a teacher/social worker during school times - some keep coming back after they have left school.I guess its natural that any new 'initative' will, to some degree, tend to get caught within the demographic of the people who initiate it - Not only who they know, but also how they look, how they speak will effect the amount people can relate to their project./end/after thoughtGuess I should of looked up what homophily means before writing this reply :).  Now that I have I can't think of any really strong examples.  Possibly some activist (political or issue based) networks - where people have a strong shared interest in co-operating?   I suppose its always going to take effort to connect with people that you aren't familiar/comfortable with.  
Yeah Alberto I've done some bits of data masssaging and it can be very time consuming.Some stuff is automatically interoperable though.A while back I noticed that this mapping site - http://sharefoodforest.org/ (which appears to use mapquest) was showing the same data and using the same icons as this Incredible Edible google map - http://s.coop/rh1x  I was thinking that sharefoodforest was somehow pulling data automatically from the google map but I notice looking now that there is new data on the google map that is not replicated on sharefoodforest. Having just looked at the Sharefoodforest map again I notice that if you click top right of the map their are KML files you can tick on/off- I'm guessing these have somehow been downloaded from google maps - not sure if this could be automated??  Guess it should somehow be possible?There is also this http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Maps and there are other efforts that I've seen to make mapping data more interoperable but I forgot to bookmark them :(Obviously occasionally you get data that has been entered incorrectly etc. and I can see that human intervention is likely always to be sometimes needed (if only to update entries). If the entry process is designed carefully errors should be less frequent.  I like the wikipedia model - open up the editing process, then if people find a tool valuable they will share the work of editing dodgy data rather than it all resting on the shoulders of a few admins. 
...
"Automated" is a very big word in these contexts, Darren. Even the better standardized examples tend to be quite messy. I participate in the open data movement, and in principle everyone is all semantic; but at the end of the day you always have to do manual work to mesh up any two datasets. In fact, you very often have to do some manual cleanup even to use just one dataset. The more interoperable dataset is not one that is designed according to state-of-the-art specs and then left alone, but one that has somebody who cares for it standing guard. That person can help anyone who wants to use the data make sense of what is not immediately clear, will patiently check new data as they come in to make sure they stack well with those that are already in there, try to keep the dataset up-to-date etc.I don't disagree with you: you should still try to plan for interoperability to be built in. But even with the best plan full automation is likely to be very difficult or impossible.
Hi Brewster,your post has been at the back of mind for a while. I find it difficult to craft a response that accurately captures my thought on the topics you raise. Essentially I am asking myself whether it is possible to contribute towards building social infrastructure that makes everyone more resilient in a society- how to weave webs of empathy and trust that cut across different social networks. That don't tend towards homophily :) Actually Im looking for examples of this in action to learn from...
I guess its best if coordination can be as automated as possible, saving the necessity for individuals to have to work hard pulling things together.  Also I guess giving some structure to interactions / work makes things easier.Examples of interoperability -http://www.w3.org/community/fedsocweb/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_webI follow this stuff a bit but I'm not a coder or data cruncher so I guess others would have a better handle on this stuff.I'm involved around the edges of Open Source Ecology.  As far as I can tell it operated largely on the huge efforts of the founder and love of those who liked it - until recently when major funding started to flow and, I think, individuals were recruited to help with the organisation / co-ordination.There have been a few efforts to make the organisation/co-ordination more stream lined by using agile / scrum software development methods.  The adoption of this has been a bit bumpy and is still under development, but to some degree, it appears to be working.  It needs some work to organise and educate about the methodology and the time and self discipline of individuals to ensure that there is really good documentation (comprehensive updates of work done / work that needs doing).Here is the 'working' page on the OSE wikihttp://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Flashy_XMThe great thing about this methodology is that, if done right, it facilitates swarming on the work load.  If people see value they can take on and complete tasks.  Tasks are made as small as possible so its easy to complete.Get enough people intersted in your work, organise well and then be amazed at how quickly things happen.BestDarrenPS that is the second time an Edgeryder has mentioned 'Project of How' to me in less than 12 hours.... guess I'm going to have to take a good look.
Hi Darren,I'm interested in this interoperability thing, mentioned it during the better support session at #edgecamp. Do you have example of those kinds of initatives?My guess is that the coordination and facilitation cost for a useful outcome is often underestimated. Because it is sort of invisible- you see the outcome in the end but not the value of the contributions that made it happen. Which is why I think Ola's approach with his project of how is interesting. And I think it's relevant to understand in our case what kinds of invisible efforts and participants in are essentional to the success of projects that contribute to the common good. I wonder for example about the Open Source Ecology project- where is the social glue coming from...is it just the shared purpose that drives it or is some solid work going into the community building and who is doing it under which conditions...I seem to remember Elf mentioning personal projects aimed at achieving tech interoperability between different initiatives to better enable us to support each other's projects. I wonder which ones are working and what the main challenges are in building more technical interoperability: http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/travelling-moneyless-berlin-reflections-road
I've been bookmarking mapping tools for some time now, particularly those with a focus on food, alternative economics and community development.  There are a lot of them about - which in some ways is good, although it means the data is dispersed - pity they aren't all linked together. Semantic web technologies and interoperability between various mapping platforms will eventually mean that data from different mapping tools will largely be aggregated and we should be able to search any area and find results from many different mapping tools.  There are various efforts in this direction.With this in mind I like to favour mapping tools with open data, also open source mapping tools as they open more possibilities in an 'open' direction.My bookmarks -http://www.diigo.com/search?adSScope=my&what=gis&sort=updated&snapshot=no 
Just disovered this food mapping tool which may be of interest to those interested in my report above:http://www.foodmapper.org.uk/If you live in the UK and know of initiatives, projects and land that are not listed, why not pass the information on?
Yes - that all makes sense - look forward to discussing it in person, which I find much easier! I'm very interested in health, and in terms of policy rather than practive I am maybe better informed than on food (perhaps, anyway) - but from a anti-privatisation direction, rather than a treatment / resilient-to-emergencies perspective...I haven't seen "the long discussion following Vinay's "War" post touched, among other things, onto the difficulty to sell resilience", but will seek it out. I'm not so sure about the difficulty 'selling' the concept of resilience... it seems to be almost everywhere at the moment (almost as ubiquitous - and approaching the level of confusion over meaning - as 'sustainable'). I'm not keen on the language of 'selling' things either - how about 'get people excited about', 'inspire', 'enthuse', 'educate' or 'teach' - do we have to use the language of markets and marketing? I don't want to be a snake-oil salesman for 'resilience' as a concept or policy - I want to live in a resilient neighbourhood/locality/community/country/continent/world! Yes, that will involve policy, but more importantly, it will involve people!
Yes Luca, we need more time to speak better of this importants themes! However think that you are speaking in the specific of the health care theme and it's an important discussion with experts. I worked as volunteer in many emergency field and I saw any problems about the logistic, organizzation and security. But I undestood that the first problem that during a lot in the time is the comunication immediatly after the disaster, the comunication tools for the citizens and istitutitutions to collaborate and restart and rebuilt and also the trasparency of the comunication. It's true that there are many instrument active as these you show me in the precedente post and these are ok for the international crisis, but there are many national crisis where the comunication don't work, the problem it's worst at local level. For exampke it was a terrible problem for the earthquake in Molise and it was the same in the earthquake in Abruzzo or for the floods in Liguria. the people could not to spaek with anyone: friends, parents, security, policy, istitutions, they are isolated. Then, when the comunications started again there were many problems to administrate the prioritys for the istitutions and also fot the citizens it was a problem to understand the situation and to get the right comunications.so I thought or I dream :-)  a software system with tecnological tools to install in the emergency filed useful to adminisrtate better the situation and also the security and specially the psychological status of the people. Also only a call of a friend, a think or a specific answer at a request of the peolple it's very important, I touch with my hand.So Luca I'm at completly disposition to built anything is usefull for our objectives! I hope that we can meet and learn by the experience and vision of all.Come on!Ciao

I'm eager to learn about your findings.I can imagine information and knowledge flowing to where it's needed, but it's very vague at the moment.I read somewhere that it's a good idea to have some "silent time" within the session, so that we can each write our notes. That way, each of us enriches the set of useful ideas, increasing originality.We'll see, I hope!
Hi, Emiliano. I hope you're better rested when you read this.Communications systems that are deployed quickly are helpful in many (or all!) emergencies, and from what I've been reading (Haiti, frontlineSMS, open-source mapping systems, crisiscamp, etc) they are being used more and more in rapid emergencies.This makes me think about the nature of an economic meltdown. A person becomes unemployed in a day. But for a community the process happens gradually - or maybe there are "jumps" when compensation mechanisms (help from families or from unemployment funds) themselves fail and, almost with a noise, snap broken. So, in fewer words, I don't really know how quickly this will play out.In any case, that's one potential difference between economic meltdown and other crises: speed.Another difference is how much communication is needed, and at what distance. In a forest fire, it may be enough if a few teams are interconnected by radio. Within the team, communication may happen via voice.For societal resilience in the field of health, maybe much of the communication that's needed is within shouting distance? Or much of the communication that's needed is long-distance? I hope we'll be able to look into that via the analysis of networks and health.If there's not a phone for each person (share!), maybe we'll need to walk more. Which is healthy if you can walk. Or maybe we need to have the younger ones use their bike and visit the ill. Or some communication is inside a building, if people can talk from window to window.medic.frontlinesms.com comes to mind ...I'm starting to see this "health resilience" experiment as a point in a hologram: I feel I'll be learning about other kinds of crisis too.(But we need to design something, and I don't see it yet.)
hey Luca ciao, for me it would be an honour to have a role in this project, because I also wrote somethings as your project, but more of the comunications. sorry if now I don't write very well or undestrand but  I did an hard trip: I started from stoccolma at 3:00 o'clock, pass for Berlino, Baden Baden, strasbourg by train and the berlino airline lost my bag....So if it's possible I would undestrand better the project and the works to do... I wrote something similar but more of the comunications. I thought to improve the priority of the comunications between citizens and istitutions during an emergency in a field (as those of the protection civil) with tecnological toolmand software to install in the field!the speed it's all after the first hours of the natural disaster.... I saw with my eyes in Aquila and Emilia Romagna!  
I am so in on this, and have been doing a lot of heavy-lifting-thinking about networked approaches to health and a networks understanding to resilience... TBC at the conference :)
Hey James, I hear what you are saying. All of your points are sound, though I disagree with the final one (will come to that in a minute).We are facing two constraints here. The shape the session takes is very much a function of that.One: 2.5 hours means we have to choose a subset of a subset of a subset of an issue, or it will be unmanageable. Health care in  a financial meltdown was suggested by Vinay as a means to (1) connect to the upcoming Greek elections (next week they could find it very hard to pay forn their national health service as the public sector runs into a liquidity stonewall) and (2) take advantage of Lucas's expertise. Now of course, with you and Simone, we have in the session two people who have hands.on experience of permaculture, and the session could be rearranged around food security (for example: how can a 20K inhabitants city in, say, Northern France achieve self-sufficiency in food production?). I am good with that, but then you have to take the lead!Two: the selling argument. The long discussion following Vinay's "War" post touched, among other things, onto the difficulty to sell resilience. #LOTE is after all a big governmental setting, so people will be looking at us with a lot of skepticism. We thought it would be a nice chance to hone our skills at pitching resilience as a sound, sensible policy issue. So, tactically we stay away from "zombie apocalypse" narrative and try to impress the audience with our pragmatism and technical smarts.Now to the point of contention:No, this does not look much like business continuity planning to me. Reason: we are going to stay clear from linearity assumptions (see my Too linear comment below). Once you do that, you refocus on needs (a very different thing from demand), and the business side of the equation melts away. If the exercise were just about how to float a downsized version of the same system you already have, then of course you would be right. But there is probably no way that's a defensible approach in a financial meltdown, so we get to be radical and realistic at the same time.Makes sense? 
Actually, we shouldn't really look at how much medication we've been using.We should look at real problems, whatever that is. The old issue of "silent high blood pressure" vs "obvious need for conversation".Could networks filter what matters? I wonder.
If someone with chronic bronquitis stops smoking, he (it used to be a "he", anyway) will still have chronic bronquitis.We need to do both.Both without much money, but with lots of other ingredients. which we should look for, and cook well.
I too think "resilience" is about a variety of threats, not always one at a time. "Interesting threats" (speaking Chinese here) - say climate change, peak oil, bad pandemics, etc - all have a tendency to be locally not-easy to predict, and then fluid when they evolve. So, for example, a financial meltdown can start out bad or worse, and may later conceivably morph into, well, war. If the threat is (or becomes) bad enough, domino effects start to happen, and then it almost doesn't matter what started it. Resilience that keeps a broad view, but that's also locally specific, is - I think - the way to go.Now, we only have 2.5 hours, so I think we need to do like when we eat spaghetti: select where to stick the fork, then spin the fork once or twice depending on how big our mouth is.If we go for "health":1) We could use a strictly limited time to look at a few "worst impacts in vital areas". No need to cover it all, and no need to agree on everything. But we might "mostly agree" on a few priorities, like, I don't know, "young diabetics would die without insulin", "baby delivery and heart attacks still happen", "what if I break my skull", "some vaccines are clearly useful", "we'll see the effects of current overweight and smoking in a few years", or whatever it is that we agree on.2) Then, we could look for ways to serve those vital, persistent needs - the system may break, but the needs stay. (Not with business as usual, because this is not about "saving the grid" but about "staying warm in winter". Focus on needs, not in old systems.) We don't need to be experts in technicalities, and I'd personally find it a good secondary outcome if we come up with a list of questions for specialists. But certainly we can use everything we know how to use: networks of people, lateral thinking, permacultural design, and whatever we all bring.I'm for it, and we'll see.
Don't have time to properly think about this before travelling but a few comments off the top of my head: 1. Financial meltdown? Resilience is about being adaptable and surviving unknown shocks - so wouldn't it be better to think about the resilience of a health system to a variety of shocks not just one?2. What are the problems of financial meltdown - we could easily spend (or waste, depending on your point of view) the whole 2.5 hour session identifying these, which would be a crucial stage if trying to design a resilient system to respond to such problems. I'm not sure we'd all agree either...3. Health? Ok I'm very interested in this, and it would be a key sector - but I feel it's slightly odd at a conference like this not to leave more room for discussion of what we understand by resilience and how we think it can be  usefully applied as a concept. This level of detail feels like it might suffocate valuable experiences people have had regarding attempting to increase resilience / thinking about how it applies to other sectors / more widely. The way the proposal above looks, the implication is given that technical knowledge of health is required?4. To me, this whole thing looks more like business continuity planning, rather than resilience, in short.Sorry - that probably sounds mean, but only because I'm stressed ahead of travelling and don't have time to comment properly. Happy to discuss more in person if we get the chance. And will engage enthusiastically whatever... 
Yeah, I agree. If you read the report, you will find that one of the sub-groups is on prevention. Prevention should be paramount anyway, but we all know it is not, and in truth health care top managers, ministers etc. care more about treatment, large hospitals etc. In a financial meltdown scenario, treatment is extremely difficult to deliver, and you just havve to minimize it by boosting prevention instead, just as you suggest.
Very captivating iscussion here.I may be a little of topic here but I'd like to bring out a few ideas i found in J.Galtungs book "Peace by Peaceful Means".He says that the word for "RESILIENCE" in human and social development is "SUSTAINABILITY". A better term is acual "REPRODUCIBILITY", capability of reprodcing itself over time by its own resources. This is not only aplicable not only for nature & for societies, but also for the human & the world level.Diverse components interacting simbiotically, here interpreted as not parasitically but as equitably, is the key.I would sugest we sould also focus on the things that keep us healty and in good shape on a dayly basis without the need of medicine. [food, living environment, risk factors, etc.]
Lucas, this is great but it has a small problem: it presupposes linearity. That means, if now we consume X mediation per week each, well, that's what we need. This kind of assumption defeats the whole point of a resilience exercise, which is built on the incompatible assumption that X medication is NOT going to be there for you. Linearity assumptions are particularly toxic for the resilience crowd since the Club of Rome predicted that we would run out of several major raw materials in the 1970s. So let's look at health, not medication. Instead of sleeping pills, prescribe cutting wood or long-distance running, for example (works a charm for me). Can we do it? You are the doctor.
"Synthesisable at the local level when the supply chain is cut" ...I've asked at my local pharmacy, and a friend who worked upstream in the supply chain. The repeated answer is "not much".I asked somebody in my twitter network who is into DIY biotechnology, with a specific question about insulin and he wrote a blogpost saying it wasn't doable right now, and there were things they could work on in the future - apparently it's not simple at all.I guess it depends. Some medications are generics (doable by several makers) and are already doable more or less in a distributed way, say a factory per 40 million people or less. (That would be a way to measure distributedness, no?) But some are really concentrated in a few working hands.Part of the trouble is that medications themselves have long and winding supply chains, which in some circumstances (a bad pandemic) are thought to be susceptible to disruption. Here, we're talking about a handful of countries being affected, with "maker countries" probably unaffected, or at least less affected. So the supply would be there, it's just that you can't pay for it because you're suddenly poor. If that's the case, then maybe some important medications should just be paid for with international solidarity money. How much and how that's handled, I don't know.Medications could hypothetically go into a spreadsheet, with how many are affected, how much they are affected, how much medication is needed (people x doses), etc. After appropriate sorting, the spreadsheet would give us 3 categories: "impossible" (impossible to do here, so we either import them, or we die), "possible" (we need to change how we do things, and we should start looking into "how" as soon as we can), and "done" (we already make them locally, so they are not really an issue).My guess is most medications go into the "impossible", but we'd need to ask real experts (world-wide) about "possible" and "done".For our exercise, we'd just have to consider the three categories, and asume each is dealt with differently.If there's money or if medications are paid for, transport is not the real problem, because these things are not heavy. Let's go for (I think) high-ish figures, and say 5% of the population need 100 grams of medication a week, that's ... 50000 x 100 / 1000 ... 5000 kilograms per million people and per week. A couple of medium-sized trucks per million and per week. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_classificationSo, factors are 1) production, 2) payment and 3) transport. (Maybe there are others, like quality control, local distribution, etc, but we can work from those 3 factors.)Just asking the important questions might take us somewhere - if not now, then later.Just my 2 cents!
Wow, really good points. The only one on which I feel I have anything to contribute so far is number 4: in my understanding we are speaking of human networks. I would probably try to design p2p diagnosis and trreatment through networks that minimize the reliance on large communication infrastructure - though you can hypothesize that there would be some nonlocal communication, even if lo-tech and with long lags between iterations.
I suggest we look at countries with effective health systems but which are "low cost" (as a percentage of GDP) as that may give useful insights on how they have managed without having access to certain elements in the international supply chain. Cuba springs to mind as an example.Some questions of interest might include:what is synthesisable at a local level when the supply cain is cut?How energy dependedant are health systems in these contexts, i.e. what happens with no petroleum?All health systems have mechanisms to allocate resources and decide not to save some people's lives - how would that work at a local level?When we speak of networks are we refering to human networks or do we hypothesise scenarios where there is state breakdown but communication infrastructure still functions? In the latter case what does this provide or enable?What lessons can be drawn concerning health systems from past crises e.g. WWII or more recently the change from Yugoslavia (effective health system) to the Serbian/Bosnian war zones? How did health systems behave in post-Soviet Russia?
Love it. Way to go!
helho,yes i'm still living in a small village in the countryside.In my opinion, i think crisis made grow up relations with land...See you Thursday!
Helho Lyne,I can't say to you the exactly number of hours that my parents or grandparents take to have their own farming.My parents have their jobs and they do these things on free time, weekends...I understand what you say...we grow up with these kind of traditions and maybe in larger cities isn't so easy...but...why not?why can't you have your own job all week and have a peace of land where you can plant?The projects of community farms are growing.answering to your questions...some food we freeze to eat later (peas, beans....) but there are some fruits and vegetables of the season that we eat fresh, for example lettuce, tomatoes, apples and so on.Yes it's possible produce more...if we have land and more time to that...we don't produce for our annual needs but what we produce helps a lot in our "home economy". 
No, Lucas, technofixes are not enough. The culture behind them, that's an entirely different ballgame. I think it might be a very powerful force!
I remember when I was little used to stay at grand-grand parents in the countryside, of course those people did not work much with money, they would rather exchange fruit, vegetables, eggs, cheese and other milk products for other goods, just like you say. I'll always remember taste and smells that I've never found afterwards, those of healthy life, in a sort of archaic way. I have a strong feeling some of those traditions aren't lost. You might be interested in this discussion on community agriculture as a way to strengthen resilience and increase well being. Also, an important question is: can this collaborative agriculture or growing own food be done in the city? apparently there are initiatives supporting it.. and the UK is in the avantgarde e.g. with the long line for public allotments.. Thanks Lenia for taking the time to share this, hope I get to read more about your life in the countryside - in that it's not clear if you still live there or not, and if not:  do you know if the relations gone unchanged with the crisis or growing hardships, or even with aging ?  what for the younger generations that at least now live so differently than our grandparents used to live, how do you see them taking care of those lands... ? My parents for example sold land when their grandparents died and there was no one to live and work the land.. they sold it and bought an apartment in the city, which in light of these discussions we have on resilience seems a bit .. I don't know, disapointing? And gone are my memories of that lifestyle and communion with nature. See you Thursday!
You should be talking to elf Pavlik. He has this idea that you can actually separate completely economics (the flow of goods and services) from finance - and, true to this principle, he has not touched money in three years! We are trying to get him to Strasbourg - a major headache because building security requires ID, and he refuses to use State ID because he does not believe in States either. Talk about living on the edge... Apart from elf's biography, he seems to imply that pulling away from state currency and onto a more mixed form of accounting is per se a major form of redistribution. You have the capacity (for health care), you have the need... how hard can it be? Just supply it, the people you are keeping healthy will find a way to keep you doing your health care. The free rider problem can be kept at bay with variuous accounting techniques.
Hey! I think you raised some really interesting points and I can actually relate to some of them. I have left home which was in Romania to come and study in the UK and as you said most of the times people don't move back to their home towns. Career and independence has also become much more important, particularly for women and it makes it much more difficult for them to settle down. On the other hand the way in which one has been brought up has a major influence on each individual's decisions so for example if one has lived in traditional family sometimes you can't help it but wish for that kind of family yourself. So I think there is, at least for me, a struggle between wanting to embrace as many opportunities as possible offered by the age and the place I'm living in and the desire to follow the example set by my family and achieve that sense of normalcy.
Hi Alberto, I really liked your blog (and was glad that you wrote it in both english and italian, because I don't read or write italian). Where basis income is mostly regarded as a distribution method in case of high unemployment rates, it indeed can also be used to set people free in order to make a contribution to social innovation. More in general basic income is a way of distributing resources (human capital) towards things towards those areas where resources are most needed. Because we are failing to do so at the moment I believe. People are being fired at nursing homes etc because of cutting back budgets but the call for health care is the same. We are losing so much energy and time in budgettary and other kind money related issues instead of working on the problem itself. 
Hey Carlien, it is always a pleasure to read you :-)Rushkoff's post is a little blunt (for example when he dismisses a centuries-long theoretical discussion on wheter human labor, in the face of rise of automation, can be reallocated to inventing, making and maintaining the machines as "it never really works that way"), but the issue is definitely there. Many people think the problem is now income, rather than employment.What I think about this is not particularly important: it s a fascinating topic, but not one that I ever thought I could make a difference, even a small one, about. Since you ask: it seems to me that the numbers add up in the aggregate, i.e. we are now producing enough wealth to be supporting everyone in a dignified lifestyle (by "everyone" I mean everyone in the West, conveniently leaving it to the Chinese state to move 300 million people away from subsistence agriculture and illiteracy and over to the cities). But the redistributive plumbing is not there, and I really don't see how we could build it by democratic means.Basic income just makes sense. At a social level, it has zero cost, because people need to eat and take shelter anyway, and I don't notice anybody starving or freezing to death in the Netherlands. Even the poorest eat more or less every day, and they go to sleep somewhere at night. With basic income, the resources to do so would come from the State rather than others (charitable organizations, or families in the case of  young people); not much difference, it is the same population supporting the same poors, with the added value of more human dignity and a better sense of security. I have even argued that basic income might be regarded as innovation policy: promise a young person her bills will be paid for a year or two, and that person will (with some probability) use the time to build something of value: voluntary work, a company, a work of art. No brainer, right? Wrong, apparently.It would be incredibly important to get beyond the job paradigm. Realistically, however, I don't see it happening any time soon - unless by the semi-autonomous nomadic tribes imagined by Bruce Sterling in his visionary book Distraction (recommended). So, I am not fighting this particular battle. Did I make the wrong call?
In the countryside, the tradition of food production does not seem to have been lost. You seem to indicate that it is still very present in your father's mind. Multigenerational families or close relationships with family members also must help at keeping food production traditions.In the larger cities, the family and neighbors ties are not as strong.Do you participate in food production yourself? How many hours per week do you evaluate it requires? For those not familiar with food production, do you think that it is complicated, a difficult thing to learn? Do you make jars or transform some of the production to be eaten months later, or is it only to be eaten fresh?How much food do you produce, compared to your total annual needs? Would it be possible to produce more, and what would it require?
Hi, I've enrolled on the Resilience theme (wanted to look at the Commons stuff too, but felt the pull of both my academic work and my fears for the future!). See you on Friday 15th, if not before...
Hi James, this is really exciting stuff. It sounds like you people are making a stab to rewiring your local community for a more resilient economy.Can I recommend you join Lucas, Vinay, Simone, myself and others in the Resilience breakout session? Join the team, there is a discussion going on as to how to make the most of it.
Hey Alberto, it's a fantastic news. Just what I thought it! :DFor me it should be an honor to stay with you in this project!Thanks very muchCiao
Emiliano, breaking news: Wikitalia, an NGO I am part of, is deploying a small suite to enable coordination around catastrophes and reconstruction. It is shaping up as we go, and if you want to be involved I'll fetch a link for you. For now it's been only a volley of emails, but I think in a matter of days there will be a mailing list or something. Hang in there. :-)
http://crisiscommons.org/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_camphttps://twitter.com/#!/CrisisCampMay I suggest something? You could try and get in touch with local people who are into free software and flexible communications: linux user groups, wireless experts, hamradio operators, etc. Ask people if there are other invitations to make. Tell them you have only partial answers (we all have only partial answers) but also a few important questions. Link the global with the local and create the space for local action.It _may_ work. :-)I plan to go to the unconference for many reasons. One is I want to see how it works in real life. I think you could perhaps gather a group of five to five-thousand people (kidding, 5-20 is good enough) to talk without an agenda, about how to improve resilience in this and other regards.If you're coming to the conference, it will be great to meet. If not, please consider looking at the resilience session. http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/resilience-sessionTO MODERATORS: Can someone please tag this whole conversation as "resilience"? This is not "help build the June conference"! In another iteration of the software, maybe we should be allowed to "tag" or at the very least "suggest tag" for posts.
Hi Lyne and thanks for your contribute and this important news about the Declaration. I don't knew it.So however I would to think at new possibility to improve the possibility of the poor people in those terrible moments. During the last earthquake I saw the cofusion, panic, fear in the face of the every person and this face worse hour after hour because they haven't anyone with speak and ask help until arrive the Protection Civil, the firefighters and when the municipalities can organized a little bit better.But also when the autorithy are a litlle bit orgnized there is a problem of congestion of the request of help and informations. In the emergency fields there are sites of the Protezione Civile and municipalities but they haven't the right istruments to work wery well and answer at the problems of the peoople. Often there are this confusion that the autorithy don't understand the priority and they have serious problems.So for this reason that I think to buid a web-site that can contain all the right instrument to set in this needs.Therefore to have a right instruments for the autorthy and also a emergency field with monitor, tablet and personal computer with the App of the emergency to write in the emergency site all the problems, so the autorithy can decide the priorithy and have all the situation in one DB, and also to have a site for the citizens where read all the information and comunication. I think that we schould work to do a procedure and strategy to regularize the situation after the first moment of the natural disasters and also for a right management of the tile of the emergency.I hope that it's all clear! 
Creating networks is one of several strategies for increasing resilience to earthquakes.Networks need to built at all scales. The presence of support networks helps keep the issue of safety current. Networks ensure that people do not feel alone. Networks help disseminate information and promote learning as well as information sharing. Moreover, networks create a benign form of disaster subculture. Therefore, networks contribute to social solidarity.According to the Geocataclysm Declaration of September 2011, "Istanbul Declaration on natural cataclysms", "Large-scale negative effect of natural disasters in recent years has shown that humanity is not prepared to enter the era of global natural cataclysms, either technologically, economically, legally, socially or psychologically."They proposed the "creation of a unified international educational system for preparing the world’s population to act before, during and after natural disasters, with extensive use of the Internet and other information technologies."Would you like to consider extending your tool to other types of natural disasters?These consist of observed disasters throughout the Earth including its core, mantle, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, ionosphere and magnetosphere. Avalanches, blizzards, communicable diseases, cyclones, hurricanes, earthquakes, famines, floods and landslides, heatwaves, lightning strikes, volcanic eruptions, storms, tornadoes, tsunamies, wildfires and busfires.I honestly do not know what happened to this declaration, if any international organisation has picked it up and is following its recommendations. If you find out, let me know: I am interested in learning more about this Declaration and the reactions of the world leaders, what the countries around the world are doing to face the increasing number of natural disasters.It's good to know that one's project is aligned with the recommendations of the best leading world scientists, isn't it?!
 Every round has been extremely different from one another which means that the players have the power to transform the game themselves and also this has given us the necessary feedback to evolve it.The two main points that I would like to highlight areFirstly, the more specific the role of the players (ex. Owner of the Chinese restaurant at the corner of street A  e.t.c) the better they perform in negotiating with the other players.Secondly, there is always the danger that the players will resort in reproducing the same social stereotypes and stop thinking critically and innovative. It is important that the players are given information and resources prior to the game in order to have deeper understanding of the issues and parameters of the area.  
this sounds really interesting! I'd love to play it!! How have the first rounds of the game gone, what if any insights have participants gained through them...and do any of them map onto the discussions we have been having on Edgeryders? I wonder whether some of the insights gained might be of use in putting Vinay's post in perspective, or even challenging it: http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/practical-resilience/mission_case/europe-risk-war-what-should-we-doWould be super interesting to know more about the actual conflicts and which solutions the winning groups came up with !
Perfect!! I m coming also on the 13th for both conference and unconference!! Can't wait to go there and meet all these interesting people and make some magic ***
Ciao Luna,I'll be at both the conference and the unconference in june (I'm coming on the 13th what about you?).And I'll be happy to meet you, let's stay in touch.Right now Day 1 (the 14th Meet the policy maker) is looking quite interesting, I cant wait to be a part of that.And I have a feeling that the uncoference will be just as good and intense as the official conf.--Medhin ☮
Washington consensus economics?Weberian rationality?Party politics? Whoops... I forget you are in a party - albeit a pretty strange one :-)
Fascinating story, indeed. I wonder what of our modern orthodoxies will look as strange as religious law looks to us now, given our history in Europe of ever-increasing freedom from the whims of the organized church and discinplinary State...We forget, sometimes, many of us at least, how repressive the regimes of the rest of the world are, and how damn narrow most traditional cultures are when you actually look at their practicies in detail.What do you think is the next orthodoxy we will choose to forget :-) ?
Really interesting! it's so important that boys and girls of second generation become the real protagonist of their own life and issues that they have to face with! I hope that could be a good example also for immigrants and for other people..i can say it as italian citizen, and also as activist in a group that is trying to work in the matter of migration, racism and society... and i can say that as educator, this is my job...in this year with my group I've carried out some workshops in the secondary school dealing with issues as prejudice, discrimination, migration, ecc.. and i've known many people that are part of second generation... i'm thinking that youngsters are the most important part of the society and they can really teach us how to live together.Your exeperience is really precious to reflect together about a plural society, that is the best thing i hope for the  place where I live.. I hope we will have the chance to keep in contact!
Oh religion - I have many views on this subject, and not all of them good!! I don't understand how religion should be able to speak on family matters when religion hasn't really moved on with modern times - particularly in the UK, but I am sure the same could be said of many countries. There are some forward thinking sections, but overall you only ever hear of the sides that just hold back people from growing and loving in way that's right for them, which tars those who are doing good with the same brush.Not going to go in to this further, but might just have to blog about it (If I'm brave enough!)
Thanks for the details! I subscribed on the facebook group and I checked the website .. it seems very interesting initiative and I think Greece should be paradigmatised by it.. I ll do my best towards this way :) By the way are you coming to the conference in June? Have you checked its agenda? What do you think? It would be nice to meet you in person xx
Hey Missy! Really cool post, enjoyed it a lot! I have a lot of questions and still don't knwo how to put them :) Just wanted to leave a word of appreciation and say that all type of "alternatives" in our world will be possible when church will slow down a bit...and I don't see that hapenning soon...
Ciao Luna (nice name),Greece form what I know is the only Eu with a situation similar to the italian one regarding citizeship laws.Most Eu countries have a softened version of "Jus Soli", and by softened I mean that there is a condition to that.The condition being, that you already have a parent living regularly/legally on italian soil for a few years at the time of your birth.That's the rule in most european countries anyway (with differencies of course).Rete G2 doesn't have any kind of membership card.You can be a part of the larger network by actively become part of the discussion, you can do that by following and adding to the conversation  here http://www.secondegenerazioni.it/ and here http://www.secondegenerazioni.it/forum/index.phpor even on FB https://www.facebook.com/groups/41820491538/Then there is a smaller group of people (actual G2 members) who are the head and arms of the organization.A network within the network sort of.We do cooperate with different groups and organization in Italy, but not much yet outside of it.We've been invited to conventions and interviews by the American Embassy in Rome, foreign radio stations (Germany), and we've been asked for the content of the various material we produce from teachers from the US and other countries.Especially our radio program OndeG2.Regarding Liberaparola, that's a good service they're providing.I personally know many 2d generation people who do the same, since they usually speak two or more languages.By the way, my last vacation as a "foreigner in my own country" was at 17 in GREECE (beautiful).I almost missed it because I had an ethiopian passport at the tiime.I won't tell HOW I didn't end up missing my trip.. but it was epic! 
Hey Vinay,let me explain.Up until the second world war, Italy was mostly a country of emigration.With italians migrating to various parts of the world (Argentina, Usa, Australia).Only in the last few decades we became a country of immigration, with people from extra european countries coming to Italy.The law in force now is "legge 91 del 1992".It enforces the Bloodline/right of blood, or jus sanguinis, meaning you obtain citizenship as a result of the nationality of one parent or of another, more distant ancestors.As opposed to Birthplace or jus soli, meaning the fact of being born in a territory should be enough to give you citizeship rights.http://www.interno.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/sezioni/servizi/legislazione/cittadinanza/legislazione_30.htmSo the law as it is now is designed basicly to preserve the citizenship of those italians who migrated to other countries, so even generations later, their children could still be citizens, even if they were born and raised abroad and they never been in Italy.That makes sense, and that's not the problem anyway.The issue is, that now all those children of those extra-european immigrants, are left out of the equation.And as a result there are "italians living with visa permits in Italy".To answer you better Vinay let me give you an example, mine.I was born in Milano Italy, from east african parents.So since I was born on italian soil and my father was a foreigner but already a resident on a regular visa, when I turned 18 I had the chance to ask for my italian citizeship.I got lucky and I got it, but let me say, you only have a window of time of one year to ask for it. If you pass 19 then you'll follow the channells reserved for foreigners.I also had to demonstrate to have remained in the country for those first 18 years of my life.I'm only an example but that's obviously the rule for everyone.Changes we would like to see (on a political level):G2 is working toward a modification of  the current law, to make it more inclusive towards sons and daughters of immigrants.(Ius soli, with )Also we include in the discussion people who were not born in Italy, but came early on in life as children with their families.For them we ask to have a privileged route to get citizenship rights (they don't even get that chance I had at 18 to ask for my right, they're authomaticly excluded).If you want me to tell you more about the kind of work we do, I will.Medhin, who actually got an american visa because of her now italian passport (It only took me 18 years!)   l    
Medhin, maybe Vinay suggested this in mischief: the European Court of Human Rights is actually operated by the Council of Europe. I see it from my office's window, and you yourself will walk past it to come to the Edgeryders conference! I would suggest to enrich the mission report with a couple of links, perhaps?
Carlien, I am re-reading this and I really think it is one of the better mission reports on the past month. I am awarding you +150 reputation in gratitude for honesty and clarity.
Hello Medhin, I really liked your story and this project... It's funny because the last 2-3 years (and specially just before the national elections in Greece) they were a tons of discussions about the immigration and the 2nd generation immigrants. In Greece it's very difficult to get the Greek nationality even if you are born and raised in the country. I like the support and that Rete G2 seems to give to people. Do you provide kind of membership for the people who want to join or it is "free use"? Do you have any co operations with other countries as well?Some months ago, another Edgeryder Alessandra posted this mission report about Liberaparola and free Italian courses to immigrants. I don't know if you are aware of it or you have already read but I found it quite interesting and inspiring specially for a Greek person as me living abroad ... 
So I don't understand the situation.In America (where I'm most familiar with immigration laws, even though I'm British) if you are born in America, you're a US Citizen, period.It doesn't work that way in Italy, I guess? You're dealing with people who's parents were Italian permanent residents on immigrant visas, and their kids are left without any status in Italy?That's so strange, I almost can't imagine it hasn't been through the European human rights courts!Could you tell us a bit more about how the system works today, and (at a technical level) what the changes you would like to see are?Vinay, who's half-Indian, half-Scottish, and didn't *quite* manage to get an American visa...
Medhin, thanks for sharing this story.You see I'm trying to figure out how to relate to the space myself. Mixed, hybrid, multiple....whatever you call them, identities. There are several posts in here that somehow brush on the different facets Andrei has written a beautiful post about mixed identities and violent conflict  in Transnistria while Decida has written about her 2Faced1 project- a creative play with how we fear and want to be percieved by others. One of the things I admire about the way you all three communicate around the topics is that they don't feel like they are reinforcing structural catgorisations. Which then become prisons you can't get out of. How did you, G2, actually get started talking about this stuff? and what do you think was a tipping point for it to have become cool?  
Interesting insight. Let me rephrase: finance is designed for trolls and greedy people. Therefore... interesting.Did you know that there are at least 5-6 people in Edgeryders who are actually involved in designing currencies? See for example this mission by Matthias in Germany. Lots of interesting comments! You will see some from Jacky in Iceland: he has a mission of his own from which it is clear that he has spent a great deal of time looking at money supply statistics worldwide. Interesting bunch!
Hi Roberto, I recognize the superficial aspect. I never got the idea that my family was very involved with the spiritual ideas behind the catholic religion. For them it was just a way of life to pay lip service to religion. That makes is even more startling that my parents and their brothers & sisters all structured their lifes , including something so private as the choice for a partner in life, within the boundaries of what their religion prescribes. It is not like in Italy that everybody was catholic. There were also lots of protestants families living in the same villages. They knew each other very well, but they didn't live together. And from a certain point of view it worked very well, the communities were living peacefully next to each other for hundred of years. Sure, after the Reformation took place the protestant religion was the only religion which was accepted and the catholics had to go underground. But even that worked out pretty well because no one was bothering them. From a societal point of view the Dutch did very well in being so tolerant. On the other hand, the decisions of the regents at the end of the 16th century very much affected the lifes of individuals even almost 400 years later. And when you think about the crisis in our current economic system, we have to remember that most of the current system is based on financial innovations which were done in the beginning of the 17th century. The dominant belief then was that people were selfish and only behaved themselves in a proper way because of the fear for God. The religion thing we have settled in the last decennia, at least in most western countries. The thing about people being selfish we have to re-examine again in order to get the economic problems fixed. Enough stuff to write about in future missions!
Wow, Carlien, thank you for sharing this. I had never thought of backtracking to the religion wars period in Europe to look for the sources of our own ways of life! This might be because religion was always a non-issue in my native Italy: people are Catholic, full stop.Now, Catholics come in all sizes and shapes, but that was always assumed to be OK (-ish): just like William of Orange's contemporaries, the Catholic church wants people to observe certain formalities and pay lip service to religion, but it does not actually demand that they really spend their time communing with God and all that. Catholics have a pretty sophisticated way to deal with wayward sheep in the flock: it consists of administering God's forgiveness for one's sins. The price you pay for that, of course, is abiding the formality of the administering: only priests can get God to grant forgiveness, you can't get it on your own. It is very hard to argue seriously with people like that! No, "three strikes, you are out", it's almost impossible to get kicked out of the religion. Whatever criticism you come up with, very smart priests will happily agree with you and then tell you that your very critique proves that you are engaged with religion, and therefore, to some extent, religious. Being anything other than superficial Catholics in Italy is so hard that most people don't even make the effort. Consequence: to this day, most weddings happen between (nominal) Catholics. But you are absolutely right: if we tell people they are selfish, they will behave selfishly. Online community managers like to say "if you design your system for trolls, your users will be trolls" (though to be fair they think troll-designed systems attract trolls, they don't turn non-troll users into trolls).
We had a few exhibitions, and each time we exhibited, people brought us more computers. Being artists, we made them into "an art installation". (Other people might think, with some justification, that what we had made was was just "a huge pile".)This is what I like about the art that takes the shape of "pile of stuff" etc.: it makes people think, provokes them, calls them to action, like to add another computer as they did. And finally something very useful can emerge from all this that is ahead if its time: hackerspaces and fab labs weren't much around in 2000 when you founded Access Space, were they. The arts people found a way to start such a project even when the idea wasn't ripe for "regular", business and technical type innovation. Thanks, folks! :)
Hi James, I wasn´t sure what you meant by, or why you distinguished between health care and social care so I looked them up on wikipedia:"Health care (or healthcare) is the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in humans. Health care is delivered by practitioners in medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, allied health, and other care providers. It refers to the work done in providing primary care, secondary care and tertiary care, as well as in public health.""Social care in the United Kingdom is defined as the provision of social work, personal care, protection or social support services to children or adults in need or at risk, or adults with needs arising from illness, disability, old age or poverty and their families and carers. That provision may have one or more of the following aims: to protect people who use care services, to preserve or advance physical or mental health, to promote independence and social inclusion, to improve opportunities and life chances, to strengthen families and to protect human rights in relation to people's social needs.[1"I wonder how much of what healthcare costs is preventible and how much is unavoidable. And how much, as well as which parts in particular, of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention work needs to be done by professionals and why?
Hey James, speaking as an economist (and relatively fresh from reading The Book on commons, i.e. Ostrom's Governing the Commons), I would like to try to address your first question. Health care is probably not a commons. A public heanth care system like the NHS, on the other hand, probably is. Here is the reasoning. For a resource to be a commons, you need two conditions to hold. Both are properties of its consumption.consumption must be rivalrous: if I consume one unit of the resource, you cannot consume the same unit.consumption must be non-excludable: it must be impossible or very expensive to prevent someone from unduly consuming units of the resource.Wikipedia has a useful matrix that classifies goods into private, public, common and club according to the properties of their consumption: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goodNow to health care. In a private system, health care is rivalrous and excludable (you can only access doctors and hospitals if you have the money to pay for their services. However, a system like the NHS is designed to be non-excludable, so it becomes a commons. We all pay into it, it can come under strain if too many people use it at the same time, but we can't easily stop others from accessing it, even incorrectly. an often cited case is that of elderly and lonely people with a lot of time on their hands and hypocondriac tendencies, who go to see their doctor almost every day - and this increases the number of doctors needed to serve everybody.
Simone, here on Edgeryders, is the chairperson of the first really successful co-housing scheme in Italy. This is his story: I suggest you get in touch, I know hime personally and he is a very nice, helpful personal. 
(I think).I neither know or interact with my neighbours.This is wrong, I always thought it is deeply wrong.Co-operative housing would also need a different architecture ...don't you think space should be also conceived in a different way ?
I think I just used an obvious alternative family as an example there :) As for keeping an alternative family together, I think this is where co-operative housing may come in. I know very little about the concept, but to live close by, or even in the same apartment block might be a good answer. I know this may sound like just being neighbours but the thing with moving away from a community for most young people is they rarely know their neighbours. The man who lives in the flat above me I have seen once in 6 months - neighbourliness is something that is becoming rare, so re-creating close communities with plenty of involvement with friends might create family relationships that work? 
I agree with all your proposals, but I was talking about alternative families for hetero people, people who are attracted to the opposite sex, but didn't meet yet the right partner.These people can't use the same sex marriage solution.Friends are great if they are friends for life. But how can you actually make them stay  for life...because friends might decide one day to build their own family, so at that point they will be less present ...How to make it work ?
Oh I don't speak from any knowledge of the subject, but merely from my own understanding/upbringing/desire. To me, a home just represents a strong sense of belonging. I've been renting now for nearly a decade and it would be nice to know that my rent isn't paying someone else's mortgage.I would like to learn more about co-operative housing and how that works as it is probably something that I will understand as a good thing for my life and others and I fully realise that a homw of your own isn't the be all and end all of families.
Hold your horses. As the old man in this corner of the Edgeryders community, I feel it is my duty to say that the vast majority of people lived in rented dwellings up until the 1980s (in most European countries but not in America). The idea of mass ownership of homes was, according to historians, Thatcher's: she wanted more people to be ideologically tied in with the haves, or something to that effect. Apparently, her administration thought  that a society of home owners would be more invested (literally) in the status quo. They turned out to be mostly right.Anyway, my point is that before that time people did have families, and they did not feel particularly flaky, quite the contrary. So I would submit that the perceived stability of a familial arrangement has little to do with home ownership. Maybe an important factor is, rather, the rigidity of the agreement that binds it members together: practically indestructible in the case of parent-to-offspring, solid but less committal in  that of sibling-to-sibling, more instable in that of life partner-to-life partner, and even more in that of the housemate-to-housemate.
An idea I've been thinking about in keeping alternative families together is to give them the same basic rights that a 'nuclear' family would have. An example from a UK perspective is to allow same sex marriages. Yes, we have civil partnerships which allows the same legal aspects of marriage, but is still not recognised as marriage as it is not performed in church, and therein, any family surrounding that union will be treated differently in some way or another. Everyone should have equal rights in order for families to blossom.As for friendships, I know what friendships in my life are ones that I will still have when I'm much older, and as such, are very much part of the family I have created for myself. These friends would also recognise the same for me, and I think that creates bonds that would be near impossible to break, regardless of blood. There's a saying that 'friends are the family we choose for ourselves' and that is very true. How we create a familial bond in terms of law and social policy, I'm not entirely sure of yet but would love to look in to it.
I totally agree with you ...the question is how do you keep this alternative family united ? How do you give these people a sense of belonging and identity ? And how do you know that the members of this family  consider you a relative at their turn (even if there are no blood ties) and not a mere friend ? These are questions I've been thinking of for a while now as I am also a supporter of extended/alternative families.
I think the moralistic purpose of family is very much ingrained to the way the conservative party think on the whole, which is why it's so obvious at the moment. Although I'm not about to start wading in to politics and bitching about the current government - tempting though it may be :)It probably isn't necessary to own a home, but I'm just coming from my own personal knowledge of how I grew up, and how stressful I find not having a permanent residence. The flat I am in now is wonderful, as is my flatmate, but to have the comfort of a home that is your own that won't be taken from you must allow more risks to be taken elsewhere, knowing that you will have a home to return to - but again not necessary, just speaking from personal desires/experience.
Hey MissyK8, Thank you for your post, you're raising many really varied and interesting points! With the huge explosion of alternatives, family life can't possibly stay the same, and should not be defined in categories and tax brackets. Unfortunately that's what governments do, sometimes simply for ease of administration.. but I agree in the UK's case for some horribly twisted moralistic purpose that I personally find a bit too removed from reality.Is it really necessary to own a house to have a family though? I think family life can be based on insecure and treacherous foundations, provided the family members can create a certain resilience to that very uncertainty... I'm not speaking from experience though!! Anyone out there?Keep well!
I would find it hard to describe what my ideal family situation would be - it would almost certainly be based on friends having more input in to my way of life rather than just a partner, and it would involve people of all ages. I think what's important, especially where forming policy around family matters is concerned, that the idea of family is a much more fluid idea. In the UK, our current government are very pro-family, getting married, very traditional way of thinking, and this fuels their policies, so people in alternative families are being ignored which isn't right. I think as long as whatever family you have, regardless of its make up is one full of love, support, and one that is educational and wonderful to be a part of, and if that's a husband, wife and kids, so be it, but that can come in whatever form you like.
Is is based on friends or ...more than one life partner...or young people only ? I am really curios to learn & know !
Hi James! This project is great! And I'm happy to read it and find you now because on Edgeryders we want open a space to discuss about how we can translate the intangible social, cultural, creative value to a tangible market one?look at this link to read more about the proposalhttp://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/shine-some-light/mission_case/what-value-cultural-productionThere a lot of Edegryders who have similar experiences with collaborative processes, free and open culture, research of financial aid for creative and social projects often defined "cool, but too innovative", with a poor market value also if the cultural, social, creative value is very high.Are you interested? I hope so! :)
Hello James, I am Alberto and I actually used to run a nationwide community of 3.000 creatives working on 400+ projects  - while working for the government in my country, Italy. All I can think of is how cool would have been to have you in there!This is great, really. And replicable! And the attitude makes so much sense:Working as an artist, I saw that the city was failing to adapt to the emerging information economyI suppose most people would go "Say what?" when they read this line. :-)As an economist, let me go through what I love about this:(social, in your case) innovation is in seeing the world with new eyes as opposed to making a gizmo. You noticed an abundance of old computers in the midst of a failure to ramp up with the digital economy in Sheffield; the whole things grows out of an art project, then of a training program, so you think way out of the box with respect to how, say an innovation economist would.cheap space enables trying out stuff. There is a clear conflict between the interest of innovators and those of real estate owners. This is surfacing in other mission reports on Egderyders as well.skill, expertise and creativity are the scarce resources of development.fundraising is painfully slow.European grants actually helped (WOW!) but only because someone sheltered you from a "frightening" level of bureaucracy (BOO). peer-to-peer help beats the living daylight out of top down teaching.communities with a purpose are very diverse.the video is great :-)I am very unimportant, but I will help you if I can.
